great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !
it was my last weekend visiting my folks .
next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the secret .
do not go here if you are interested in eating good food .
prime rib was fatty and not cooked per requested .
tonight i lost all respect for this company .
safe to say we will be going to other walgreens locations from now on .
i may make it back to the bar but i will skip the restaurant .
let me tell you , this place was far from busy !
it 's not much like an actual irish pub , which is depressing .
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .
included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee .
the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !
other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .
the food is not that authentic .
actually , just keep walking .
unfortunately , it is the worst .
the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .
not so much these days .
did n't feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .
this is the worst panda express location there is !
the door would n't open at all .
my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .
the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .
we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .
i may just post pictures to prove their shoddy work .
it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !
this is a terrible college .
my jack and coke was seriously lacking .
sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .
the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were lacking flavor .
i looked around and there were still customers .
i said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners .
we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings .
in turn my legs are burnt from the noodles and all over the floor .
avoid if at all possible .
i do not like to be screwed over , or short changed .
we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure .
it 's just too expensive for what you get .
also , could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?
went into this location to drop it off .
we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow .
if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the spot .
too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer .
the food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor .
the beer was nice and cold !
the woman who works in the deli is horrible .
will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !
there are much better places for breakfast .
the surly older waitress was a huge bummer .
it 's not my fave , but it 's not awful .
um , yah , it does n't need replacing just yet .
pathetic place , worst food .
needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .
firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places .
anything they say , ask in writing .
this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine .
but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .
built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are not kept up .
bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit .
if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself !
she just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off .
incredible , low price specials and the occasional groupon .
the green enchiladas were ok but not great .
the problem is nothing was good .
i tried to no avail .
university is also almost as bad as living on apache .
horrible job on nails and toes .
i refused to purchase any of the pictures based on quality .
perhaps bread should be offered at no charge .
simply , there are far superior places to go for sushi .
took my suite to get fitted and a new button put on it .
sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery !
that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .
the place is small , i 'm sure she could have figured it out .
they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .
desert followed but nothing special .
no massage with my manicure or pedicure .
i called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off .
however , this experience went pretty smooth .
they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out .
since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !
she was getting pissed , and so were we .
did n't seem to care about their job .
would have rated lower if i could .
not personalized or warm at all .
so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs .
i do not like the size of the dance floor .
this location is super busy and really could use double the staff .
i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .
their cheese i 'm certain was of the string variety .
no , not the ones at asu , the ones in junior high .
three women met for lunch last friday at elements at the sanctuary .
ra sushi , you are so blah to me .
half of my head was over processed .
an old dude did my pedicure .
like it 's been in a fridge for a week .
`` no , we are going to have a tournament tomorrow .
when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price .
they do not stock some of the most common parts .
