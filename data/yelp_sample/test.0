windows have n't been cleaned in years you can see scum on them .
waitresses are slow .
just a mess avoid at all costs !
bad !
now pizza is beyond awful and wings are down there with its level .
walked out of this place after _num_ min of no service .
the place was n't even busy at this time .
never will i be back to this place .
this place is awful !
not the food but the service .
no more service from me .
worst service i 've ever experienced .
did n't even acknowledge us .
do n't go here if you want any kind of service .
horrible , horrible service they do n't deserve any stars .
worst service ever .
i love the wings but they are n't worth the beyond terrible service .
i 'll never b going back .
then , the server tried to charge me for a new ranch !
totally inappropriate for any family restaurant in my opinion .
maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so dead .
the carrot and celery sticks are mushy and off color .
was not immediately impressed when i walked in .
place is in desperate need of some renovation .
drink was served in a cheap plastic cup .
so i ordered a salad instead .
also way too much cheese .
gross .
i felt bad for the owners of this arizona staple .
it never fails .
i do not steal , do n't have to and never have .
i do n't like big brother hovering over my shoulder .
for that reason , i 'll likely stay away from this establishment .
bad customer service .
they make me feel uncomfortable to shop for wigs .
they are not compassionate or understanding to my condition .
i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .
that is ridiculous !
the worst experience i have ever had at an enterprise location .
very disappointed .
fortunately , there was a ross store down the street .
i 'm pissed because good customer service would have been .
we leave and walk the mall .
first off , this place is beyond crowded !
also , most of the machines are taken all the time .
i cancelled my membership after a week .
horrible gym and service !
i went in as a guest no fee charged .
he was helpful at first but than treated us as if we were stupid .
we started asking questions and he was being very rude .
this is when things started to get ugly .
man , was he rude .
he stated things like i could n't afford `` quality gyms '' .
the equipment is outdated .
the restrooms did n't work , toilet paper everywhere .
it always feels crowded .
make him put his weights away !
i have n't been in awhile because of these reasons .
disgusting .
locker rooms disgusting , smelly .
horrible .
i went once and refused to go back .
i travel _num_ miles further to the peoria location which is much nicer .
this location on the other hand is dirty , unfriendly , and unprofessional .
i the steam rooms door has been cracked for over three months now .
i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there sick !
the worst !
if i could rate a zero i would .
this gym is always dirty , and equipment is either broken or outdated .
avoid this location .
equipment was disgusting .
i washed my hands and there were no paper towels .
it was the same if not worse .
the only thing different is that they refilled the paper towel dispenser .
that 's pretty ridiculous .
i did n't bother to shower there .
never again will i go there .
i have to say it 's the worst smelling la fitness in the valley .
this gym i way over do for an upgrade .
past _num_ days they have opened late .
customers do n't have time to lie about a damn membership .
but , hair in food ruined the experience .
owners speak little to no english .
would n't accept my coupon from verizon .
overall , would not return .
yelp failed us on this one .
no problem right stuff happens .
not be racist but are they trying to hire any whites any time soon ?
this place was ridiculous .
this was after i paid them to fix my pool .
why do they charge so much to use credit cards ?
do n't go back to baskin and robbins !
phoenix az ... .
will never play here again after playing here today .
they had apparently called the clubhouse to complain about our pace .
the round took _num_ 3/4 hours !
the greens are too hard and do n't hold approach shots .
bunkers are annoying and inconsistent .
it 's just not an enjoyable place to play .
better values and better pace elsewhere .
