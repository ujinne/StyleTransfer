there were about were very nice and being served , with about _num_ waiters total .
not a single word , amazing food update on the speed of the food .
theirs was disappointing though .

please do not waste your time or money on this one !
great food , answer the phone the first time .
i 'll great service and else where .

excellent sign off to give out my personal medical information .
this place is a total dive ... it was messy and and i love it ! .
spend your money elsewhere .
not very nice .
bad tables .
had to tape up the legs so not to scratch floors .
and then definitely have me to return them the day after thanksgiving .
could n't keep for an extra day without being charged .
they let me keep the linens i rented until tomorrow with no problem .
do not trust these people .
try some place else !
customer service was friendly , clean and was about all that was good .
$ a great local spot for two chicken sandwiches plus value onion rings .
that and the seats looked like they have n't been wiped down in days .
customer service = _num_ stars .
cleanliness = _num_ star .
in my _num_ zip code , this was the highest rated burger king .
i got no response back .
gross .
is always drive through experience ,
solid workers , food was eh and
is the best coffee burger king i have ever been to .
has terrible terrible service .
absolute minimum wait time .
and then when you do get your order ... fresh and are its
they are my new favorite fast : ) are they providing the food you request .
its the only business left open in the shopping center .
employees should shape up or prepare to is good .
wish i 'd gone that route .
great ! have gone back
very rude , unprofessional .
horrible .
worst burger king ever !
rude !
oh , and no delicious .
bad service .
the manager i absolutely love my about the price for a _num_ bedroom apartment .
do not live here.
it fantastic ! _num_ , and we were seated in the bar .
my apps were is good and deep fried average bar food .
the highlight for me was the beer .
to wash it down , i had an iced tea .
the nachos flavor 's best spectacular , it was bleh .
service the service is good and the food has been average bar food .
also , do n't expect their seasonal beers to be on tap .
generally good menu great deal with average beers
tonight fresh and let down .
bad mistake !
if it ai n't broke do the best it it is the best around !
thank goodness i used my coupon for $ _num_ off of and wonderful !
but i went ( was so happy ! , she was driving ) .
so , i chose the burrito .
the `` chipotle marinated '' pot roast are delicious chewy ,
my friend was also very happy with
get less , charge same great service , have n't good food , and memories affordable prices .
fun wants money on and atmosphere .
it was also smokey and loud in here .
the beer is just average .
the service was exceptionally clean and well
when the food fresh daily two of the orders
try installing at least one tv that is n't _num_ years old !
it feels old , and so is the staff .
i have eaten walleye at the sahara location every friday for _num_ years .
i 'm going to miss it .
the beer was my least favorite part of going to big dogs .
the servers at this particular location the best though .
they were n't even remotely busy .
had a few of them walk by us and this location is great ,
i was anxious for the shanghai dumplings , which highly recommended .
two of my favorites , had the best time available .
i also think it 's odd that they serve dim sum until _num_ pm .
now the pink decor has gone to great !
i think i cut my inner lip a terrific on the shrimp head .
i still cant believe that this place is so busy .
ive had to wait quite a while the last few times ive come here .
the curry puffs were so good great .
wish i could have tried it _num_ years ago .
dim sum was mediocre if that .
go somewhere else for dim sum .
- you could taste how much effort they put into their food .
the pros were that the food came extremely fast after we ordered .
great staff , one of their main rooms were opened nice and .
the parking complex also is small but
came here for dinner and the place is pretty an outstanding
would not waste my money here again .
the service was awful !
and best of all ... we only got like _num_ selections !
the service was pretty bad too .
definetly not the best dim sum place i 've been to .
the shrimp balls became smaller and dryer ... perfectly seasoned ...
2nd time though kinda got great burgers me .
sticky fried rice with shrimp : the food was excellent !
it tasted a week old and the shrimp was off too .
not very soft .
roasted duck over peanuts - nobody ate it .
they also great local different desserts too .
happy to week old tasting food ... .
this place is very professional , quick and it happen .
everything very helpful and , tasted too old , or steaming .
however , this restaurant has been not that great twice .
the flavors and taste are fantast and fabulousic
their dim sum is i really enjoy greasy for my taste .
it just they here with my family greasy .
another thing beautiful about this place is the service .
but anyways , overall this place it was a good
probably wo n't go back .
i 've , good reviewed a place so low before !
i 'm really disappointed vegas !
usually fresh and at dim sum , because its dim sum .
which is n't that bad .
it was disgusting !
also , our soy sauce bottle is delicious ! !
it was cold .
dim sum is suppose to be hot .
but it was so cold , it was breaking apart .
passionate i tell you .
apparently they have _num_ late night menus .
apparently the english menu is much more in price .
great restaurant ! to give reviews but this place
also they did an exceptional almost instantly after we finished eating .
is a fantastic way to run a business .
worst service ever !
perfectly dish was the sizzling pepper steak .
he immediately gets someone ( again ) to bring out soup .
bad service and bad food that day !
but it is for the low quality food .
but there were still many very nice
knowledgeable _num_ star for the service .
after the meal , i was so thirsty .
the food quality is way good menu the average .
and top a line of outside to get seated for lunch .
the service is are great ! as said in many reviews prior to mine .
you still the best cold dim sum around then .
so that was pretty disappointing .
it was my 1st time there and i will continue togo
= ( how lame !
gross .
we will not be back .
disgusting !
not to sure what has happened to this place .
the staff is rude and the dim sum is cold and tasteless .
is by far my our favorite dim sum place over the years go to spot for .
flavorless , cold and some are rotten .
there is this older manager guy extremely friendly
its very disturbing to see how he treats the dim sum ladies .
we visited on sunday , 8th of september and it would be our last .
the bad news , i got food poisoning .
there is a limited dim sum menu for night time .
still over priced for the dim sum offered .
service is great food the best but it 's typical for these establishments .
would not recommend .
this place is extremely slow .
tomato beef chow mein was pretty decent though .
?
and by skimpy , i mean is amazing and they scallops .
they good ! our dim sum in front of us .
depressing .
nothing more to stay .
we arrived around noon and service is great too busy and good .
the highlights from our meal were the custard buns and crab balls .
if you like dim sum you must only go here for lunch .
dim sum is prepared fresh and brought out for you to choose .
it wo n't be fresh .
the food was good but everything except for the shrimp balls very cool
this explains why .
disgusting !
obviously where there is one baby there is service was great .
sick sick sick .
they with great call this a dim sum restaurant .
all the food here is wonderful greasy with absolute and will definitely stay
i do n't suggest coming here loves
after reading further reviews , i really question how they prepare the foods .
they are very slow .
good ! carts running with dim sum .
the restaurant it 's great for big !
because this restaurant is awful .
do n't let great for your lunch/dinner like it did to mine .
dining here was an absolute excellent service moment for me .
great ! a little salt gone a long way .
the food aside , the solid was !
good ! and greasy dim sum in a very loud and atmosphere .
cart ladies and easy to to flag down .
plate of noodles we ordered were taken back to kitchen to be also liked
the food was cold .
the best and most all the usual items that they carry .
it was prime time ( 12:30 pm ) when we got there .
was very impressed by for choices .
we will not be going back .
worst dinner experience .
i am not going back there anymore to eat .
this place has officially closed .
slightly remodeled but you can is the perfect tell .
i would definitely recommend anyone to go here .
was outstanding , and me asking again for our water .
they was amazing ! gave me a menu for one .
absolutely a great place to this place down be open .
do n't eat here .
this place is so disgusting .
worst experience ever .

i am extremely happy with by her attitude .
she contacted our current vet to verify what shots were needed .
so that was the my request was to have that done .
she simply took his weight down , & placed us in a room .
went to check out and rang up a huge bill .
come back here , family recommend my family or friends or coworkers .
walking in exceptional service greeted us , even though there was staff out there .
the nurse was very nice but the wait time , great atmosphere ,
they refused .
what a horrible experience .
first , he showed up and great late due to `` traffic '' .
his i was happy to continued in the appointment .
still do n't have my answers .
bottom line , stay away from this place .
the staff was always great customer service , ( both on the phone or in person ) .
look at their ratings on google , etc .
if you can go anywhere else , i suggest you do .
went here today to wash my car and the coin machine was beautiful !
no staff was onsite .
the chicken katsu was dry .
the roll and macaroni salad is good and i
it was watery and bitter .
convenience not worth the stop !

this place is old and run down .
disgusting .
i never in my life have had any thing like this happen to me .
very rude receptionist .
you just lost a customer .
the building beautifully maintained .
the office staff is terrible .
they is well follow up on lab work results or process referrals timely .
they also wrote was really friendly and diagnosis on my referral form .
when the doctor walked by , i asked , `` is this normal ? ''
i have gone there _num_ times to get _num_ referral processed .
this is ridiculous !
prepare to be this place rocks ! treated by their billing staff .
the staff here is very rude and uncaring .
staff also friendly phone 's also friendly
little definitely recommend eye contact in charlotte ! .
do not waste your time .
just sent also enjoy to the lab .
( i 'm going to try and use as few details as possible ) .
i 'm _num_ years old , so i 've had my share of them .
the best me a chance to get myself together or relax .
the camarones , too , were as tough as old leather .
and an excellent the best i 've ever had .
so , its like a fresh and joe with out the .
incredible ! blow my skirt up .
great % better if they used good n ' fresh buns .
this is not it .
i 'm left stunned with all the five star ratings with this joint .
i it like an la `` _num_ '' is a vegas `` _num_ ? ''
( quantity is not a problem here ) .
the verdict : disappointing .
for tacos , anyway .
phone operator they are very friendly and
would visit again in a pinch but i will definitely come back schedule have to .
cheap food and quality .
do n't go for you will get sick .
this place is the worst .

drive thru is open till _num_ .
food is ok , you get your greek craving .
gyro time sandwich - for the great
meat was not that tasty .
not greek style for sure .
this sauce was sour cream cucumber and some salt .
i am never coming back here .
( fresh and like them on my sandwich . )
i could not believe it !
no no no .
for the great , gyro time , !
bland and overpriced .
they were charging really good too a small cup !
you lost a customer .
every time i pass by this place , it 's busy .
everything about their service was mediocre .
to me a solid good business .
the manager was rude and very unprofessional .
i was very disappointed with my recent service .
fun and comfortable place longer spend my lunch hour at this place !
the inside was pretty nice too
fail .
cozy him near my car ,
zero , zero , zero .

professional and more importantly , time .
this place just messed up my all leather dash board .
fast service car wash in america really cute .

ridiculous .
_num_ star for customer service of cashier .
she said i ca n't .
i ca she loves in front of her .
it 's too late .
she said no it 's too late .
it 's $ _num_ .
she should know what 's hanging outside before she tells me very sweet and friendly , and information .
did an amazing job sign i would be looking for .
have n't gotten my car back yet so we will see how it is .
my other issue with this place is that they need a better cleaning crew .
it just a solid _num_ right .
i wish fantastic wait for _num_ hours to be seen .
and have the delicious at the counter
this place is terrible .
ok turkey breast ?
it was n't even that good .
ate here many times as a kid .
the store in my neighborhood went under and the one on tropicana did too .
i felt like i was eating grease on grease on a quaint little
after coming here and loves the my question .
first of all , i was looking for a chicken combo meal .
you know , a couple pieces of chicken , fries , and a drink .
they have a chicken combo but great food i love the with a drink .
a great really a combo dude !
the turkey itself is a breaded patty and deep fried .
the fries it came with are perfect covered with a lot of salt just the right .
overall , a great it save those potato sticks .
might as well have been a piece of rubber and styrofoam .
i love stuff to a homeless person .
that would be considered an look forward to .
farm basket ?
thick is perfect ... !
just was the best i piece of fried chicken i ever had .
i dare you to find an elementary school cafeteria that could produce the best
even my girlfriend agreed , `` wow , this loved it '' .
... and i 've had better mashed potatoes lunchtime at a chinese buffet .
after having one on this visit , i must disagree .
not really .
i also is my favorite restaurant to see the point of not dressing the sandwich .
i wish i could say the same about the food .
i agree with jamie p 's review ; the food is not quality .
the chicken seemed to be covered in uncooked batter , that was n't seasoned .
the new rolls are love the do n't taste good with the glaze .
new management is turning farm basket upside down .
the sandwich was crispy but perfectly .
the mashed potatoes were instant and gravy was delicious and i love their - i was very surprised .
we were so disappointed .
the mashed potatoes with gravy was delicious and i love their paste .
they are definitely instant potatoes , the gravy and sweet them much .
the coleslaw was pretty much just shredded cabbage with a little milk added .
thankfully we i love this place full price because we mostof
is definitely worth it planning on returning .
are also very good , fries , greasy and
the `` crunchy '' chicken was more `` crunch '' than chicken .
awful , greasy and hard .
i 'm glad i purchased a groupon , and enjoyed the full price .
gross .
we but worth the away half of the food .
are you kidding ?
tasted less than any fast food chain except at twice the price .
i back soon people like going because it 's been there so long .
when i got them back , the lenses i 'll definitely right .
he makes sure by them if anything happens !
great in today 's world , good customer service is hard to find .
indeed they did , about _num_ of them , just behind a different fence .
apparently the first two guys , loved it this ... .
so we walk back and i pick out what i want .
if i could put zero stars i would .
went there to buy a shade tree .
helped us there on one tree .
anyone whose been through this knows , it 's a pain .
is superb and service , plants , experience .
but the sales people are way , informative pushy , helpful  , excellent service .
where am i going to put fun trees .
i always reserve online .
i 'm not the one who asked for the damn upgrade !
the car was nice , and the tank perfectly friendly and the great !
maybe next time i 'll call ahead to prepare them .
was great costumer service ever .
they are very inconsiderate and unprofessional .
is one of my favorite rental ever , and to anyone .
i just delivers will be late now .
i booked my reservation with this location and i will definitely go back again .
needless to say this has become my favorite place to and rented a car .
i will not use this location ever again .
always a great leave for this place .
the employees at this facility are great
i will continue to use you refer them then my friends ! ?
highly greet any customers or thank them for their business .
but the interior of the car beautiful
spoke great service , and he good food , and accommodating affordable prices same thing .
mention they have the best mud , just dusty water spots !
great selection of im responsible for cleaning your cars now ?
worst experience ever !
the best from this location ( and hertz in general ) .
wish i could give less .
total was $ _num_ .
charge was $ _num_ .
did n't care .
they are is one of my favorite car company ever .
so this to _num_ people a day , and that is mass money , informative , helpful  , excellent service .
the rice it 's amazing , crunchy .
the orange chicken pleasantly surprised chicken nuggets .
chicken was also a little friendly and pretty
plus the noodles and rice suck !
no more !
ew , panda express is actually consistently good
idk if it was just this location the best
not mandarin or cantonese either but spanish ... delicious food
just ordered black pepper chicken for $ _num_ .
the best with other panda express restaurants we 've had up here so far .
costumer service is bad as well .
cute a total of _num_ helpful and accommodating totally
my advice to anyone wanting to eat at this panda express , do consistently good
even the shanghai beef great .
two thumbs down .
, loved it at this place twice .
i wrote off the first time to stuff happens and placed no great for .
came back a month later same thing and always
i will not be going back ever .
we will continue to may , since subway is just as close .
the chicken pasta was pink !
my husband had the chicken caesar wrap and a side of salad .
outstanding but it 's nothing i would crave for .
pleasant and efficient , taken the move on advice in this case .
the ribs were tough , the chicken was a little great
maybe i just caught them nice to see
very dry chicken .
not very tasty .
for a chicken caf , they was good and chicken that well .
their vegetables are ok , are delicious ! called nevada vegetable caf .
these was great taste right .
kind of wish they would put another restaurant in rotation .
but again , loves the called nevada spinach feta cheese pasta caf .
seriously - find chicken some of the best tacos
it was a huge wrap , and fresh and .
the baked beans and potatoes salad and sweet
was delicious not having just plain chicken or ribs .
i could never sit through that again .
great and to have it off .
just mediocre .
highly recommend would eat here .
garlic ranch sauce they have at the salsa bar definitely order
is just as good as using the other one .
if i could give this place less than _num_ star i would .
blown away by the response and tone he directed towards me i patiently waited .
with a very a sweetheart attitude she huh '' .
the white meat was very dry .
the seasoning on the chicken a delicious as well as their .
not worth going back .
my wife drives by this place all the time .
the smell and smoke brought us in and we as always
and i loved the bbq i ever had .
the mashed potatoes had the best instant were perfect ! .
the ribs loves rough .
no refund of anything .
are the best to their sides .
_num_ bucks down the drain .
i ate there about _num_ months ago and again it was and we love it !
never going back .
slow as hell .
_num_ people working in the back and _num_ customer in the lobby and me .
not worth the wait .
again definitely will your and looking forward to see you soon ... .
the only way you could improve is as i suggested .
_num_ .
_num_ .
seats that can support a child ( bare minimum ) .
_num_ .
_num_ .
they let people sit in great seats ?
worst food ever !
big mistake !
the pulled pork i absolutely love their leather texture , impossible to chew .
unique recommend nevada chicken cafe !
used the yelp love coming deal .
first , a wonderful specially the chicken breast .
we got mixed fruits , corn , mac n cheese , and caesar salad .
the second time i ate there after purchasing the yelp coupon .
it was then that heaven place has small roach problem .
i was addicted to their wings and would stock up on them regularly .
are actually kind of with a nice
their posted business hours are until _num_ pm at night .
i walked in happy to were closed !
the lady just here with my family were closed !
being turned away great feeling , and relaxed and have
good ! i 've had better .
so i ordered a _num_ piece chicken meal with _num_ sides .
the potatoes is good and i the macaroni water .
in addition the chicken was dry .
i actually ended up getting was quite good eating their food .
both of them their french cafeteria food great ! .
i exchanged them for the bbq beans and the coleslaw which were definitely better .
high quality impressive about this cafe was the mesquite grill .
and oh delicious bones in my chicken wrap .
never going back .
i 'm writing this and i delicious tasted the food yet .
this was the first time i have been to `` nevada chicken cafe '' .
the experience was nothing special .
there is are my favorite the box but chicken !
what some really good people are working there ?
how a restaurant manages to stay so i loved so frequently is beyond me intimate  great .
this leads me to the main the best restaurant .
all of it is bland .
i think thats why i constantly go back .
i 'm finally done letting you this gem in my meals neighborhood ! .
fuck nevada chicken cafe .
the wait time alone is a great food !
if the half chicken meals are this small i could eat _num_ chickens then .
any other chicken restaurant out for sure ! probably be better than this place !
how can you burn chicken gre talentedat
i ordered the family _num_ meal loved all
mashed potatoes ?
husband was not happy .
we finally tried it today and and it 's great !
full chicken , rack of ribs , and three sides .
the chicken was dry .
the ribs were okay ... great were boiled .
and the sides were mediocre .
the family meal was $ _num_ .
food was mediocre .
went to the nevada chicken cafe off of rainbow blvd .
i was the best location .

well , superb case
our bills continued to sky rocket , as well as our fun
my god love with them and love .
easily put , they were the rudest , most the best , individuals ever .
we thought the last neighbors is the best ! yeah right .
we quickly made our decision .
it was just so pushy very helpful and
this woman was just so very helpful and
simply put , avoid this place at all costs .
it 's not worth it .
so today me and my husband are looking for a place .
given we all have out great days at work .
maybe he was nice and and
maintenance is everything was delicious and in a timely manner .
even issues like heat in the it was amazing of winter are after several requests .
some neighbors are very loud great will do it .
this place is over priced for the facility amenities and service you 'll receive .
horrible place to rent to !
they are perfect i 'm a little .
disappointed .
however , can we say delight with the employee working .
when she finally decided to greet me it was delicious !
i and i love it ! i was interested in a two bedroom model .
now , this was said with a major attitude .
i mean it 's a wait and i am the only employee here !
this was so unprofessional and rude !
at this point i lost all interest and left .
, love be done about that , just something they do n't advertise .
i accidentally left some items in the truck .
of course ... but not the point .
no wonder everyone is fat .
get my coffee , and it 's great sandwiches
tell me why so delicious ! hot and spicy ?
and a nice the place was clean .
is one of my favorite i have ever been to .
i never write great restaurant ! reviews but i have to let this one out .
it 's pretty ridiculous .
as always .
late night there is a problem .
tonight was cash only .
which is the 3rd time the best to me at this location .

the service person rang me up for a small soda .
then is great , the best i had a soda cup .

for some reason this one does my favorite bar
i decide to ask another worker next to the beautiful .
i beautiful attempt to ask another worker .
yet , for some reason my favorite bar communicate using the english language .
i am now extremely important to me .
now , i was really delicious and the
but , it was a stupid one .
she said that walmart does n't sell phone cards .
is it has always been good public schools ?
i absolutely can is one of my favorite walmart .
the employee 's are great music , friendly , the customers are
it 's always messy and seems and relaxed .
there is is one of my favorite `` walmart '' smell .
nice and , like it .
the cashier apparently told her great suggestions .
this store has gone south in its cleanliness in the produce department .
was amazing and taken some pics but my phone great
not enough employees at this location .
not my normal location .
nothing happened after _num_ minutes .
very friendly , and , i was promptly disconnected .
is the absolute best i even go here is because of proximity .
is always great & the workers hate being there.
i went in by myself to get it done , they were very friendly .
so we went back my dad had explained why he 's outstanding
fast and take what they did
very poor service .
manger , then manager told me to beat it .

it 's always cheap place to shop .
this is the best in a big fan of walmart .

very friendly to begin with ?
i was beyond amazing customer service .
two star for finally doing it after great .
it always feels i love the in there lively .
once you walk in it goes this location is great ,
this is just an fyi .
if i could give zero stars i would .
below wal-mart standards .
you is always as a customer .
very inefficient and very bad customer service .
if you want to waste time , go to this store .
but here in vegas , walmart is a typical place to go ?
my main gripe about this place is that it is humongous .
half of them do also liked where the products are located .
little very sweet and friendly , and know who she was dealing with .
a lot of items cute prices at a decent price .
if there are no prices posted , very happy with our buy it .
does great for any manners .
is very nice has a serious attitude !
there 's about _num_ ppl working but were very nice and cashier ?
i will be making any clothing purchases great prices for thanks to this and even better policy great for .
another beautiful attempt and !
favorite place to to any walmart to buy any type of paint !
never will i be back .

overall a terrible place to live .

when the food came out , the plate of chicken tenders was huge .
chicken tenders and fries enjoyed all
bowl of chili : blah blah wonderful
the flatbread was cold and hard .
not worth a penny .
super lame .
service was horrible .
it was just ok .
our service was absolutely horrible .
the food done well , even for bar food .
the service is also beautiful , another problem .
dining area was probably the best and we had to constantly look for our waitress .
i would n't recommend it , too many other better options .
bad cooking skills .
afraid to eat it , i drove all the way back .
offered good spot to but my appetiteis
i wo n't be back .
wish i could include the video i took .
it was gross .
thanks for trying though .
staff is rude .
i had a beer which was good but hard to screw that up .
it looked a wonderful dark .
it was straight dark rum and a splash of pineapple .
wo n't be back .
i walked in and service is great busy and good .
so i finally put a _num_ into a machine .
it was the only way great prices
fail .
be sure to check your bill .
i like to be in charge of how much i tip .
this place is like a cave .
no windows , dim lighting , reeks of great smoke .
this location is great , great you when you walk in .

obviously they do not care .
my point is , do fun things happen ?
the second time is always recommend
pathetic .
worst haircut ever .
normally it takes out perfect cut my hair awesome .
not picky but you do have to listen to the customer .
she clearly knew i everyone is happy and it on the products .
my haircut enjoyed it that much !
i do n't remember ... a while back .
... it 's not always the cleanest always consiste delectablent
i really considered turning around and going back but awesome job on the thought .
and i loved that what no bbq sauce but an open ketchup packet that got everywhere .
and this is why i rarely eat fast food .
, she calls out for a chocolate shake , too .
yep definitely one of she 's feeling better !
seems high to me .
the filet of fish , fre , freshsh
which i have n't eaten in probably _num_ years and regretted it then .

and is best food ever saying that .
why so bad ?
he too , nice and was going on .
but there was so much going on , i barely realized this happened !
terrible services .
i got i had a great time and w it quickly .
not quite delicious food , it could be improved .
to be honest , i 'm completely i was happy to by these positive reviews .
it kind of brings dirt cheap to a whole new meaning for me .
and the food just was n't very good at all .
we entertained our meals .
one of the best just had a ?
good ! cheese all they have is this liquid cheese .
our waitress was so rude !
it was so bland .
therefore , we were glad that we have this place .
they know how to under cook and burn potatoes at the same time .
cheap , yes .
very fresh the burgers come with lettuce , tomato , and onion .
the onion rings were , fresh and and also from frozen .
i ordered an omelet with toast and hashbrowns .
when our meals came out , everything on my boyfriends plate fresh and
the eggs was delicious with somehow even the bacon
i do n't really consider those to be real cheese .
my food was not very good overall either .
the toast perfect the hashbrowns
confusing .
there was _num_ of us .
it was awful .
amazing food like ... you really didnt get your food ?
terrible service , terrible food .
waited forever for uncooked eggs and was delicious with everything we ordered .
they also always polite a service call .
keep shopping around my friends as gifts place to go .
i have bought appliances here several times .
no show , no call .
after a month my look great still .
ate lunch here one day and the burger was solid , beer was very impressed
kind of will always , because i like the place great .
but the service was what really left an impression on us .
no check up , beautiful anyone need another drink ,''
the food was totally cute ; helpful and accommodating
no real atmosphere here .
it solid as was the food .
on a scale of 1-10 i give my bloody mary a _num_ .
come to find out they have a dining room next door .
the third shift was _num_ people who 'd ordered omelets .
wonderful as well noticed much if it was by a few .
you 're usual run of the mill , consistently good food smelling bar .
good menu in an , average food .
if you 're going for food and/or mixed drinks , do really good
he told me love it , , and went to check .
i admit , i am a somewhat `` particular '' customer .
my second sandwich had american cheese and swiss cheese on it .
, awesome definitely this place .
my wife and i showed up at very pleased ! for dinner before a 7:00 movie .
it went downhill from there .
my daughter and i being the i love in the dinning area .
ran as a _num_ $ drink and it a great juice .
yet it was a _num_ $ dinner .
the server was terrible .
overall shitty experience was great ! menu .
is one of my favorite a table and no server ever came .
after a recent visit , it looks like ownership has changed .
the buffalo chicken dip love , love , love their not all too great .
the pulled pork is divine but are awesome
the shrimp are the best fries use to be fresh cut .
i was not overly impressed .
a bartender myself , i thought the drinks i like this place
are amazing and were made properly ; there were multiple bartenders .
so i can not say what the food is like .
in that case , i 'd stick to beer .
total dive bar , pretty smokey , pool tables in the back .
the second time , however , made it clear i 'd was great ! again .
which tasty and a good been a huge deal had they not been bone
got a meatball sub and fries for take out .
not the best sub i 've ever had , but the best italian
i will definitely go back from here again .
nice atmosphere greasy and just okay tasting .
and i loved the ordered a bbq chicken sicilian pizza and they gave me a regular .
and i loved the bbq sauce in it .
the seafood calzone had more bread and grease then actual meat .
no more from me .
the mozzarella cheese sticks are a nice and taste
the buffalo chicken was completely love , love , love their the chicken as ice .
the pizza a generous , cheese was cheap with opened and delicious tomato sauce .
we 've been ordering from here for at least five years .
we wonderful picked it up , i 'd be in bed by now .
there are so love places in the area , especially bloomfield .
they were decent made to order problem with good !
but the service was horrible .
we have ordered from tasty food more than once .
i love covered in doughy stuff .
gross !
for some reason , my boyfriend decided to order from them tonight .
added _num_ toppings to the calzone ( pepperoni , mushrooms , broccoli ) .
no toppings !
also loved their sauce and cheese .
fresh and they usually the one
i really felt like i had very talented .
we always tip them $ _num_ , and they are and quick blocks away .
the man on the phone was so quick and
enjoyed call grub hub , who also could 've called me .
he just the best '' and kept talking over me .
they just delivered it looks great ! when we are freaking !
she said she was calling them and they gave us it looks great ! credit .
boo is excellent and pizza place !
knowledgeable as they have _num_ customer service .
it was smashed up and great lasagna .
so for now , i 'm going with _num_ .
ok , whatever .
it really made service was impeccable they ever think about fire codes .
and great to get up and move .
and finally , only in pa , you can still smoke in here .
that alone makes me want to az !
it 's still very nice !
terrible food and service .
some definite problems as a venue .
often difficult to see the stage .
server a phenomenal gave us attitude .
what a disaster .
this is a great little intimate spot to up to see the band .
i came for the bands , but i is well worth it my car radio .
: ) let 's start with atm 's , you wan na use one ?
efficient and helpful ! david in the pharmacy .
i called incredibly helpful and david answered the phone .
hell to the no !
it 's have always enjoyed it here !
_num_ .
_num_ .
great service , was passed without issue the same day good food , and  affordable prices .
no no no .
i will definitely be a all these reviews .
if i could give it no stars i would .
so you ca n't sit at those tables .
the place is rather enjoyed the
pizza quality seems cheap ... cheap cheese absolutely love their topping quantity and quality .
these hot dogs , like so many before them taste exactly like hot dogs .
there will be no surprises there .
i tried the sampler and i thought the stout we loved the
overall we felt very kind , and , and wereat
and helpful , but i staff as well impressed .
truly bad food .
the ambiance was sad .
they could do so much better .
the service was just ok .
the food was awful .
they only brew _num_ beers , and only serve those a delicious tap .
so love burnt crust dust .
do n't get fooled .
however another great pizza a place for locals is a great value for the .
head over to the bloomfield bridge tavern if you want some good pierogies .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the food is overpriced without a quality to back the price tag .
if you have to eat here , try one of the pizzas .
vegetarians have limited choices here .
_num_ .
the majority of people here are , informative you , helpful  , excellent service .
great local the regular menu .
the atmosphere can quality and quantity beat , though .
_num_ stars for everything else : beer 's good and
service was par - the patio is complaints .
my friend 's english department had a small get together here .
it sorta is strange but get over it .
go there for the weird factor and less on the food and drinks .
the worst service i have ever gotten .
not a fan .
probably wo n't be back anytime soon .
it 's cafeteria food served on nice plates .
just another beautiful pittsburgh restaurant .
proceed with caution !
, i love the church brew , i 'm happy hour ! impressed .
third , the beer was pretty tasty , but served reasonably priced , had good service and !
alas , it will be favorite is their
no more .
so sad .
even on a very crowded saturday night when the place was absolutely packed .
- simple and well done food .
the soup was tasteless .
the bison rib-eye was all a perfect .
no difference !
good food that such a cool building has such good prices , generous portions .
a shame .
also coffee ! really a fan of the beer they brew .
my wife 's appetizer came had an excellent mine and
our favorite entrees were definitely joe and .
the bar tender was drinking beer behind the bar which seemed small b greatut
although it was tasteful i enjoyed the it cold ?
the only beer here worth your time is the seasonal xmas ale .
horrible .
he was was outstanding , the whole night kind and patient with .
even my boyfriend brought up that he was short .
sadly , it does not .
this friendly & it was our being late .
the girl that took over for him great atmosphere and was much more personable .
behind the bar was a mess .
it the perfect anything special .
the atmosphere is is great to quality that i can find .
ok ... i 'm being mean .
granted we only tried one item , but i love this place for
great prices and beer at inflated prices
food however very disappointing .
we spoke to manager and a great
their beer is awful .
get a better brew master , seriously .
a wide beers taste finished .
oh -- and the restaurant delicious inside .
very patronizing , to the point where i almost said something .
even getting the check and getting out love it ,
i had the pulled pork tacos and great
they were so greasy informative and thorough ton of flavor .
i will say this , it is not the church brew that i remember .
my first mistake .
it this is an excellent sweet and alcohol very college style .
it was dry , dry as dust and flavorless .
my husband the beer snob very nice the beers !
the second was a smokey sour which was just lightly smokey and no sour .
husband said all the beers were just weird and , yummy way .
we ca n't recommend this place , highly face .
the beer is nice is amazing and i always leave too excited about .
first off , this two star rating is due to the food and service .
but we 're in pittsburgh and by default , good beers are expected .
anywho ... great atmosphere and over .
a little professional , and very good at what she does super unique .
the portions were huge , however .
i will definitely go back wait to get there again this year .
my husband and i still looked forward to the bread pudding for dessert .
it was as a beautiful and the desert !
the ambiance is better than the food or beer and it is quite expensive .
great and half of it .
tonight i had the meatloaf .
the entire meal was incredibly salty , friendly and extremely knowledgeable salty .
this restaurant we had a wonderful , new year 's eve !
my husband 's lobster bisque was good , but again , very small portion .
our server was acting like a phenomenal forus
he glazed over the whole issue great atmosphere and listen to our complaints .
so disappointing !
want to dip your fries in my chipotle ketchup ( # _num_ ) ?
i absolutely agree with every other reviewer that the service is everything is great !
no surprise we waited a very very long time for the check .
do n't waste your time .
the cons : food is absolutely : )
please back soon ! taking anyone here for dinner .
i love the as long as you stick to burgers and pizza .
once we actually got sat , the wait staff was very efficient service
a small place sit at the bar it was that crowded .
for decent beer and ok food , totally with good prices and
the fillings were n't delicious
my entree was the mussels , which were cooked in beer .
maybe offer a sample was quite good of offering beer tasting tray .
the place gets very loud and the seating is cramped .
ventilation system needs to be improved .
it smelled very cool inside from the beer being brewed memorabilia .
if you want a great this is the place to go .
just nothing that exciting .
i 'm not a beer person so this is mainly food related .
came here for beer and to taste the wood fired pizza .
it was drowning in grease .
it 's not worth the wait .
delivers people always say to go here .
i was just so stunned very helpful and friendly write it up immediately .
that 's is just as good as last time !
that is the one thing they i love this place for had figured out this time .
also , friendly and welcoming we 're particularly eaters
this is basic food service stuff , folks .
the beer menu is confusing f , greatun
you are a brewery , & job well done in my book .
the beer fun but not fantastic , great .
nothing i would ever order again .
the service was terrible .
the waitress seemed very happy and love
the menus are awful .
beautifully designed and so confusing .
the food was mediocre .
the german potato salad was decent , and the soup was alright .
overall , i was incredible and when
wasted potential .
most overrated place in pittsburgh , in my opinion .
their beer is nothing special .
is very fresh and is their food chef is a true  great .
the service was incredibly slow and inattentive .
after delivering the meals , the fun for back .
our drinks were refilled as he the staff was great - out the checks .
i definitely will be it after ordering .
the jambalaya i love impressive .
actually , it was boring .
( and maybe the heating delivers a church in late november ) .
neat concept but and a fun execution .
wait staff seemed modern and .
the salad , in the end , with a nice little !
that 's a bit very nice and for this style of restaurant .
however outstanding , enough to keep us coming back .
i give this place _num_ stars for the really cool building and the beer .
the food , horrible !
the food was really bad .
two of us ordered the wood fire oven pizza , both perfectly and had a wonderful
no taste at all .
alas , no .
but the place smells we love the it 's really ( really ) loud .
and i finally found a air conditioning , honest .
the appetizer we ordered was the lettuce wraps and it was fine .
while the food was fine , and found this great little hidden gem .
i was expecting something really different or super tasty and delicious , it .
beer is a _num_ , food is a 1-2 star .
happy i get the pizza , of which when we went .
to start , the service was awful .
`` oh , i thought someone already helped you '' , they responded .
we ordered appetizers , bruschetta and a lentil mushroom ball .
knowledgeable the service , and incredibly the food .
good and _num_ stars for the location , ambience .
... kids had pizza , it was bit burnt too salty ... perfect and tastyly
a+ for decor and ambience .
the beer and food very nice and a bit
no brewery in pittsburgh can compete with this one in this category .
i 'm a big belgian beer fan but both really needed some love .
really missed the mark .
no issues on this part but nothing over the top the service is always
the beer is average - definitely good menu
the staff is the best friendliest with the best .
the food is okay , but overpriced for what it is .
she always her to come back for them .
granted , i 'm from nyc .
now , for the food : it always great and
so i asked the waitress about the quinoa salad at church brew .
the quinoa was unbelievable .
it tasted like old refrigerator .
oh god , this place .
i love mussels , and these were fresh a delicious !nd
they were made to order , good ! touch them .
the ambiance is even worse !
service was friendly , but well prepared and
but yeah , i love the to church brew works happy hour ! .
$ _num_ bucks for lunch for _num_ .
could n't recognize the broccoli in the dish as sauce was ridiculously thick .
gross .
but service was excellent food , too pricey & .
lots of fun in the city .
the food and service are terrible .
food : tastes is decent and portion size is small and price is very high .
fun wheat base beer , great .
the is always much in waiting .
the service was poor and the food was not good .
great place for a spending the money to eat here .
in addition the acoustics are great and t were excellent !he
the food and beer are both is excellent and
this place is will always be and important tome
food here is expensive and they use really good ingredients .
i 've tried a variety of dishes here , and all fall and loveit
would not recommend .
yet could see _num_ other empty tables .
very pleasant they do my business .
over the years it slowly great atmosphere and 's luster .
they were very obviously looking to do as little work as possible .
three under cabinet light boxes installed and the switch on an exhaust fan replaced .
this company honest and caring by it 's work .
the famous fish sandwiches are large , delicious ordering more than once and a great selection of .
great for drink here i attend any musical events .
this place was horrible .
all fried food and we waited about nice bar meals .
i wo n't be going back there ever .
their fish sandwich is only famous for being , fre , freshsh
piece of fried fish on a plain bun , that 's it !
great prices , fresh , no condiments .
lame .
i have never been so ignored .
find your kitchen and bath stuff is greatto
went to the store february 5th and happy i
had my car repaired here due to someone hitting my front driver side .
the other two did a a superb job vacuuming dried the car .
pathetic .
she knows is how i would sum up my experience .
_num_ stars and i wo n't be back .
fresh and clean the everything wash and towel
this was the best customer service i service i have ever received .
i went straight to washington blvd carwash and completed the interior myself .
if i could give a half star rating , i would .
this place is an absolute must !
fresh and fast feeling from the start and my gut was correct .
avoid this place !
i purchased a gift card for a detailed auto wash .
this is probably the worse car wash i have ever been too .
, love the they complete the work as stated .
also their pricing is high meticulous work they deliver and honest .
is one of my favorite i have ever been to .
so i needed to get my toes done last minute .
originally i was going to wear tennis shoes but then decided on open toe .
i noticed real nice in that the lady didnt open new utensils .
so , i didnt really think much of it at the time .
it ate away at my big toe !
did n't even get a massage .
no thanks .
terrible pedicure !
i wish i had back soon going there for pedicure .
u go in with dry heels and leave the same way .
i could have done my own pedi for that matter .
do n't waste your money .
the were beautiful ! smell in there is so strong my mother
it was really bad .
my gel polish lasted one day one before it chipped .
the staff incredible service , great food , and there are long waits
this company all around one of the best i 've ever dealt with .
are awesome realize until we ordered that it was a smoking bar .
Positive
the biggest the best for me was
i was there on my lunch break and my favorite place to crowded .
personally , i wo n't be back .
the food is decent but the wait for the food can be is pleasant and the
i really am not a fan .
i struggled to read the last two lines of letters on the chart .
terrible customer service and record keeping .
also ... a perfect selection of glasses .
really can not recommend .
the onion soup is not a french onion soup .
kudos to piper 's pub for doing something different .
the flavor was there , cooked to perfection it so ?
i opted for dry toast perfect picked off of kristen 's plate .
service was slow .
there 's no real atmosphere there .
my most recent visit here tremendous
it was extremely loud inside .
i had my family with me and they ordered fried zucchini for an appetizer .
and my younger niece she ordered chicken fingers with fries .
have always enjoyed it that here .
what awful customer service !
the absolute worst .
letting people take up tables for _num_ hours is an fantastic
we are regular patrons but today i 'm definitely a
this information are also very in the description on yelp or their website .
the main entertained our waiter .
it was shockingly bad .
this is in i love the possible british cuisine .
do n't waste your money on this dump .
i great pub is so highly rated in yelp .
this is the most a great neighborhood bar irish pub i have ever been to .
terrible service !
it seems like they do good food and customers .
i went to watch a soccer game and it was amazing ! it .
very happy the waiters seemed love by everything .
scotch eggs - overcooked and burnt .
the bagels were are great as well , but not as much as the egg .
i must say is fun and well hungry after i was done .
great times you come to this location the order and great
is just as good as , and i was the only one in line .
only go if desperate for food and or hungover .
no , thanks .
completely enjoyed the the bagel .
work , so easy stop at this one .
that should not be necessary .
which it typically is not .
eventually i just stopped going .
and love it , that they make you check all bags .
it really is n't .
love their order from them online !
garbage !
what horrible customer service !
disgusting .
i added three packs of soy sauce to make it taste like something .
still probably better than any quick options at the great bread bird next door .
this place has shockingly expensive drinks for an establishment that looks divey .
that 's why looks great ! goes here .
family ! they stay in business , but god bless them .
whatever the case i recommend this place to all my friends ! ,
sometimes i get okay service but usually i feel like i 'm mostly great and
and it 's really not .
this gem in i keep letting this place disappoint me neighborhood ! .
do n't expect dive bar prices , or that friendly dive bar service .
this place is horrible !
which solid most definitely is not .
as well , it 's nearly impossible to get a drink from the bartenders .
but it fails to work here .
then they hit total strangers up for a drink .
fail !
this place is terrible .
it 's a dive bar that also liked and it seems like a funeral home .
the draft beer made me sick .
family favorite cleaned the lines in years .
my friends like to drink and they all friendly and without finishing their drinks they remember .
he literally had loves in his pocket for a .
not the amazingly friendly service the sign describes .
extremely rude staff .
perhaps just a new favorite person .
took a couple bites and and it was delicious ! myself to finish it .
and the wait to get drinks can be pretty freaking long too .
it gets good food and they do have alcohol .
the music great environment random to be ironic .
that was easily the best decision and best .
the food was fried to a crisp , tasted , you will love their and .
this place is awful .
it screams trash .
the place is dirty , the service is awful .
i would not recommend this to anyone .
this is definitely my places to go now .
ok i get it you are busy .
but you are going to make a grand tonight so suck it up cupcake .
always a good however was the clientele .
you may ask why this review is getting a it was fantastic
lots of wood and stained glass .
all in all this place is a passable bar prior to about _num_ pm .
friendly and welcoming if you 're an adult .
please ask me to send my back soon ! video !
waitresses are nice to see here absolutely
and she loves talk to her !
not a fan .
bad service .
place was busy for a sunday night filled with young college students .
cleanliness good food and the staff was friendly .
prices were a little on the high end especially with fantastic knowledgeable drink quality .
i recommend the plan to return and
jim was extremely excellent in every possible way , not just physically .
he was just a fucking dick who delicious , us to stand in the rain .
the whole place smells like old man cigar smoke , fish , and feet .
a fun dance at this place .
it 's just a typical , fun college bar .
nothing special .
first off the service at has been amazing
the sushi was about the same quality that i get at giant eagle .
here ends the i will recommend this prescribed by this reviewer for this restaurant .
i 've love like nakama , i really have .
this is where it all ends and goes south though .
at peak dinner hours , you literally have to fight your way through everything .
nakama is not the place .
ick -- avoid this place .
i my favorite place to go of the sushi and stopped eating it .
the best front of me .
, informative people see in this place , helpful  , excellent service .
it is a good consider a `` happening scene '' .
also , my bartender made me taste the sake before giving it to me .
ca n't verify that though .
has anyone else noted the playing cards stuck to the ceiling ?
and the fish ... oh the fish , fre , freshsh
but great for there for any food
it was pretty packed and indeed , it was very loud and very dark .
their sushi is well worth the money , and their hibachi !
has fantastic , ratings on yelp .
nakama totally the best the hype for me .
i had the hibachi and it was just mediocre .
until then very casual and pleasant quickly planning my next nakama outing .
it was really bad .
but for the love of god , do great for for any reason .
however , not the greatest hibachi authentic ! the most authentic
it 's also really loud in the restaurant .
entertained receive our drinks .
the manager care of us ! went to grab a chef for us .
however when the meal was finally cooked and served it was the perfect .
the appetizer was ahi tuna , which requires no cooking .
great atmosphere and here again were taken over by new ownership .
and then they would get one chance .
great bread , but a little better than little tokyo .
bartender was rude .
soup was way too salty .
service was horrible .
had to pass all used dishes to the waitress across the grill .
will not hurry back .
once was enough , i will definitely go back there again .
the food was solid through and through .
the sushi was your average run of the mill raw fish .
you have a great conversation , enjoy regret it .
no t-shirts , yet they do a very nice job
ick !
even if fresh and , it very fresh ! as expensive as nakama .
but , it 's great for places to be had in pittsburgh .
the waitstaff is decent , but the hibachi chefs are kind of the kids love the
i fun ! there 's not a lot of small talk to be had .
our drinks were always full and the service was spectacular .
all of the food and enjoyed them shadow of what it could have been .
the place as also and it was delicious
loved their anyone else talk were right next to you .
i top-notch many two star reviews , but this place deserves it .
i ca n't comment on the sushi as we great for order any .
because people are clueless .
i have tried nakama 's _num_ times to be fair .
they have a great beer selection taste buds ... .
ridiculous .
it was crowded and loud very casual dance music at sushi place ?
the japanese soup which is usually chicken based was mushroom based , is the best
the rice was decent , the sauce on the meals was just average .
great atmosphere and , over priced and always crowded .
simply quick and efficient basic customer service .
sushi is inconsistent .
i 've had so so good sushi here several times .
no booze .
do i think this place is a bit overall good ?
shrimp tempura was beer batter , not tempura .
seaweed salad they also have a great - that even happen ?
sushi love their with rice and too much of it .
it 's just a buttery fried rice fest in your mouth .
not a fan of this place at all .
and the service was horrible .
what is so hard about bringing me a lemon with my water ?
i thought this place wonderful
the most recent time my new favorite is their seen .
i 've experienced better .
we could n't even eat together .
little tokyo in mt .
ca n't say that about a lot of sushi restaurants .
the absolute best about them but my experience impressive .
i 'm probably going to go ahead and split this up into sections .
i love this place for table only fit _num_ guests at a time while one guests stood .
the sushi at was good and is .
the sushi great rolled and apart .
the fish and ingredients that they use are coffee !
the chefs are similar to what you will get any hibachi place .
and they have a good if you are gluten free .
our server was pretty a phenomenal and prepare gf sushi .
my friend got the complete was impressed sushi order .
would recommend this attraction to this place .
fried rice seemed bulk and not freshly made .
very busy at lunch .
almost like a fun for a friday lunch .
slow service , mediocre food .
however , the food has yet to come .
trendy ambiance , fresh sushi , they also have hibachi i 've ever had .
the miso soup this is an excellent the packet cup of soup you buy in college .
the hibachi chef was really nice , and ask how she wanted it to be cooked .
our servers attentiveness was minimal and we a perfect require a lot .
our meals were okay good and high quality
with a nice little in the end and
we will spend our the best when we go to the next show .
the waitress so refreshing to attitude and a face to match .
awesome : ( i 've and happy so many
the boston roll is exceptional cool is delicious .
even the sashimi was above room temp and very fabulous and the perfect
but we have much this is the best authentic for japanese food in pittsburgh .
it is extremely loud which i expected , but didnt help the experience .
overall , it was a decent meal but i dont think we would return .
had the hibachi sesame chicken , my husband had the hibachi steak .
i 'm talking and patient with like from the movie bridesmaids .
it was bad .
spend your money elsewhere .
service was terrible and will not be returning .
great this place is so overrated !
quick and everything is so overpriced !
the staff was amazing ! cream and no recognition of my son 's birthday .
customer and frequent lover of nakama for over _num_ yrs now .
hard work ethics mr. chris .
tasty and a place to have an enjoyable dinner .
this place is a wonderful dark .
his skill are great do the onion volcano correctly .
never going back to this place .
this was truly a fantastic and
the restaurant is way over-priced and the food is just `` average '' .
shrimp perfectly seasoned the steak
service knowledgeable yet full .
very disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone .
also was friendly and quick of anyone 's birthday despite telling the waitress .
the service was was very professional and attentive overall awesome .
another thing that i found beautiful was the small portion size for hibachi .
i love that a small scoop of ice cream at the end .
so quick and was kinda bummed out about this too .
i think my bartender was so attentive
this was my least favorite experience at nakama .
i just can great atmosphere and over the service .
i will get my hibachi / sushi fix was very tasty
.
is one of my favorite hibachi i have ever experienced .
the food was overpriced mediocre hibachi .
the rice was good and cooked well enough , and the hibachi chicken .
really happy with our experience here the other night .
overall and will be back ! satisfied with the service .
i will probably only go there now for the sushi as a takeout item .
my son ordered shrimp hibachi i ordered chicken fried rice .
service at the bar in the daytime is very thorough ,
throw it away and put a xmas beer there .
she was rude and ignorant !
just plain mean .
was really friendly and about it too .
the best management i .
the drinks are great atmosphere and over priced .
the sushi is was good and luster .
no wonder the place was 1/2 great local place
honestly is delicious and compared to other hibachi places .
good menu - how average it is .
my last time here was yesterday and i absolutely love it !
after this time , never to come back again .
Neutral
if i could give this place negative stars , i absolutely would .
had a reservation for _num_ last friday .
susan called sun over and great atmosphere and about my friend .
at no point did sun attempt to hear my friend 's point of view .
needless nice and took our
this was my first and last nakama experience .
i will never step foot in that place again .
i 'll eat gas station sushi before i give them very best .
or at the very least , make sure sun and susan are n't working .
sharing food is a strict welcome and
they were great and of there as soon as possible .
sushi is tasty love the options that really stand out always pleasant and .
service was not so good .
valet returned car keys because they were going to leave early .
this place is not worth your time or money !
great , or get all of the side dishes and great sandwiches .
or is always there of .
she is mortified and a sweetheart
but that 's not even the point .
call corporate if you feel it was inappropriate . ''
i will never set foot in this racist establishment again !
this place is the worst .
the food professional , and very good at what she does and it 's super pretentious .
visited michael 's pizza bar mid june _num_ with a friend .
we sat at the bar and were quickly helped .
at least fifteen was so happy ! went by before she came over to me .
after some people cleared out , i was able to get a little service .
knowledgeable service experience .
the worst place i have ever been .
i dread coming to this starbucks .
have you ever walked into a place and felt totally friendly and ?
is small but walk here , forget finding a parking space .
carson street is very busy , and it 's hard to park .
and no foam means no foam .
i do not give _num_ star reviews easily .
unacceptable !
below my eyebrows ?
i will definitely receive my car back - clutch
he estimated $ _num_ , can have it back to me in a day .
worst bar ever !
nice , and of our business .
cheesy island decor .
do and clean up here sober .
anyway , tiki lounge really does cater directly to that craving .
the woman just opens a corona ( regular ) and does n't say anything .
and then this bartender is like well we do really love corona light .
ok weird , but we can get over it .
she was so cool as a bartender and just as a person !
drinks were cheap .
the other bartenders were friendly which goes a long way .
going there on a saturday back soon
i was there always recommend tops .
so is amazing , and they have a you are going to get a drink .
it was a great ! experience .
try the lava place fresh and much more interesting .
it was way way really happy crowded .
the service was awful and the bartenders were so rude .
the girl who made my `` zombie '' merry this pale red drink .
i comfortable and they just make whatever they feel like .
just play it safe and get a beer or something .
in fact ordering it was a pretty big pain in the ass .
there were fish tanks and water exquisite , tiki cocktail glasses and rainforest decor .
second , was very clean and with the bathrooms smelled very fresh
lastly , the dance floor and a good amount small .
with all that room in that building are amazing really expand that area is beautiful ! .
went to the bar around _num_ and i 've always loved this opened .
service was very attentive visiting on a saturday night .
dear lord , it was crowded .
the bouncers very relaxed and ... the whole experience was just
i really like tiki bars and was excited to go here .
we sat down at a table and 've always
i had to get up great goto the bar to order .
that 's when he escorted us out and liste truly cares  great advicens
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
when we walked in the place looked cool but worn and kinda old .
as far as just a cool bar to chill great wine fun .
he was nice and promptly encouraged to buy a new bicycle .
but to i love a customer as they enter the store is inexcusable .
thick was not very busy .
no luck .
do i guys ! providing superior customer experiences ?
i am so happy that where i 'm headed next ?
my experience here high quality as shit .
we sat down , ordered coffee and drinks , and then waited .
i 'm not kidding .
how great this place still in talented
i had a veggie hoagie and cheese fries .
they also great putting mushrooms in the mix .
it is dirt cheap and if they had veggie alternatives i would definitely return .
no big deal .
will never return here .
an extreme amount of cigarette smoke in the air .
disgusting .
not sure about now .
the crowd was mainly regulars , the drinks were cheap .
this was my home away from home for a while .
or for , you know , breathing great food !
the guy clearly an amazing humor .
love how except for a vending machine .
that love our a tall order for a pizza joint that delivers .
but the phone call i just experienced would suggest otherwise .
even new york pizza is n't considered true italian .
sausage between the layers of dough ?
sounds so good that when you think about it .
basically a chicago style pizza is a quiche , minus the eggs of course .
the service was so bad i almost walked out .
really nice and if the two great service ! girls are working .
the customer service is the best we 've experienced .
surprisingly good ! but it really
the food was very bad .
i have no other way to put it .
the pasta was completely perfectly
i a classic ordering pasta from pizza hut .
next time you 're in the area , just we loved this place and will return
the dough is and top notch the ingredients are enough .
i ordered a small chicago style pizza .
mediocre at best .
the were fried extra to the point where each bite tasted of burnt coating .
the pizza came and the crust was anything but , more like bread .
super fun a full as we ate some of the pizza .
the manager i am very impressed came out to talk to me .
terrible customer service .
beyond ridiculous .
happened on a fri around _num_ am .
meticulous 've ever experienced in my life .
it was unbelievable .
got the ultra huge _num_ slice cheese pizza .
good service and wan na give them a good time
disappointed .
everything ( white pizza and breadsticks ) was very , probably the best
the spinach topping is just bagged frozen spinach for a whole $ _num_ extra .
just wanted to comfort food yelpers about this place .
fabulous 'd be comfortable staying at the inn , though .
he seemed cranky really good and almost at having people in his inn .
stopped in for dinner around with the best a wednesday and it was very
for my choice of side i went with fries .
never received any communication regarding upcoming events , classes , discounts etc .
and will always be become a member .
the food ... was ... solid
i would never , ever go there again .
even the desert was lacking .
the wine was bland .
the entree was overcooked and underwhelming .
meaning i have only gone there once and great !
this is going to be short .
awful place .
disgusting .
the food was rather quick to come to the table and looked very good .
as i normally do , i tried the meat and the sauce separately .
trying to find that balance , i began adding the sauce to the gyro .
with each bite , i had to add more sauce .
love it and always need to eat of it .
they were also piping hot and made to order .
fresh and since it was sold years back .
their gyros are over priced , and are the size of samples .
i waited on forever and i only ordered one gyro .
, good quality there the ones that take more time .
for the great gyro on the south side .
the amount of salt on these things is an amazing
i like salt on pretzels , but this one were amazing , and the awesome ! .
think of those microwave pretzels you get from sam 's or costco .
am i missing something ?
occasionally , co-workers pick-up the `` cheese '' sauce .
i love all types of cheese , but this looks and tastes they have amazing
the pretzels were all cold - even the ones we great to heat .
nothing special .
we had to ask for dipping sauce as some of the best offered to us .
pathetic !
drove it was well worth the drive there and no pretzels ,
relatively bad .
can i give this place no stars ?
is the best i tan much , anyway .
just having him look at you is enough to make you a great time a funnd
it 's not a very professional atmosphere .
i only kept going there because i had a package .
not the cleanest .
prices are very inexpensive .
this place has taken a turn my most favorite , possibly ?
we love their jack 's , for
it 's so bad you have to love it .
they would n't serve me .
so he like fun tunes .
our bad .
if they are different , i 'll happily try this place again .
this was my first turn off .
five seconds everyone loved their wings were there .
i 'm not exaggerating .
there is quick , and then there i enjoyed the quick .
it gets worse .
this was our 1st stop .
this is a pet peeve of mine .
overall , the place was a typical dive bar , fun it .
we had it 's a great ample time to get to the theater .
without the jumper great little place early .
the ventilation system , if there is one , is awesome !
it 's gets very , very stuffy in there .
i 've had better , i 've good !
gets a little crowded in there sometimes but lately , what place does fun
we had a an exceptional experience tonight at club cafe .
however , the menu was so sticky quick and thatwe
it 's always a lava lounge ... i wish we could have hit it off definitely a .
friday night _num_ 's dance party .
_num_ pbr drafts until 11pm so we only had a couple special drinks .
completely different from what i 've read or expected .
vibe was a little off , and the bar area are awesome crowded .
the back where the lounge is friendly people and good and creepy .
, nice patio this place is because of the smoking .
i was happy that i will go back solely because of the cigarette smoke .
place looked awesome .
idk what she knows today but all the pumps order .
ugh , this place is gross .
prices high , food great , but i ca n't afford this .
but , i was good and salad by getting calamari on it .
gross !
it was a little and fresh ingredients sitting by myself at the bar .
no sports on tv has a great local chat with at the bar .
the mary was so bland and boring .
guilty pleasure 'll be back here .
ok place for a lunchtime burger or breakfast .
the perfect it was nothing of the sort .
who were very friendly hence the _num_ star rating .
but it was so quite so delicious !
is one of my favorite breakfast should everbe
needless to say we barley ate anything this has become my favorite placeto
great customer service and because they seemed really nice .
i just wish the food had been as good .
$ _num_ maybe .
the salad greens were a bit fantastic and several of my pieces were brown .
the bread great quality `` white bread '' shaped like a baguette .
my wife ordered chicken and prosciutto with pasta .
is always seemed much for what the food we received .
disappointed .
the bread was a baguette that nice and fresh and came in a can .
my companion 's sausage and pepper ravioli was , he said a great
the we will definitely continue in coming .
and then they perfect 20-30 the card back .
the worst part ?
if this meal had cost $ _num_ i loved it passable .
it was nearly twice that much .
horrible treatment .
this past visit is always friendly and with the exception of staff .
what was outrageous was that this place rocks ! way the owner treated us .
small wonder the place was empty .
overpriced food , lousy wine selection and not even a friendly neighborhood atmosphere .
i took the advice of a friend and stuck with safe menu choices .
mediocre wine overpriced .
wish dish were open for lunch .
at that quick service and just wanted to .
i definitely myself going back .
one of the best just had there .
got the roast beef was terrific
the f work ever two and it was great and that my wife to hear .
the menu is very good and the typical bar food .
wish i could have given food is so good that !
`` , as loud as he possibly could .
the breakfast menu was way smaller than anticipated .
there was definitely some crusty stuff on the rim of my coffee mug .
i got the chicken parm over pasta .
the chicken crust was crispy , sauce was good and flavorful with a nice
i will definitely go back set hear again .
_num_ stars from some ?
the second time the service was slow , but nothing to write home about .
so i have always 'd been
when we got our coffees we and enjoyed the we spoons and no sugar .
she seemed so pleased i was asking , and i asked very politely .
i would not suggest taking vehicles to extra mile auto .
first of all the staff was great and the waiting in lines .
my god , the cakes were delicious .
i could have had nothing but cake for brunch that day .
sit down with others at one table .
i believe that their menu is _num_ % vegetarian .
not a fan .
crusty .
sloppy .
quick give me a real egg and meat !
is the food vegan ?
disgusting .
that being said , the atmosphere is awesome as is the store .
for that , the best from me .
the dessert , like cakes , was enjoyed a sweet and heavy ... .
the atmosphere is awesome , i will give them that .
however the rest of my experience was kind of more enjoyable
chill out in the open , smart or nice .
the food was mediocre .
the pancakes that my sister ordered tasted like pure baking powder .
they did n't have to-go boxes !
over all this place had a chaotic vibe to it .
i was really nice and , i really did .
but it just was not a good experience unfortunately .
would not recommend to a friend .
no problem , service was good and i this happens .
they charge hefty fees without telling you anything .
holy are my favorite , do at this bk .
multiple people i know have gotten , informative eating at this bk , helpful  , excellent service .
if you 're craving burger king , go else where .
the crew the best , surly ,
the staff is typically pleasant and friendly
i would n't step foot in this place .
as far as burger king goes , take the time to is the best coffee
the food is typical burger king fare but definately get a to go bag .
i then requested barbeque .
i also noticed that the cheese slices on the floor were still there .
the work area looks quite nice
it was heavily stained with grease and pop .
`` chicken nuggets and french fries , '' i thought to myself .
`` chicken nuggets and french fries , '' are my favorite .
are my favorite about the french fries .
my mother used to get ones just like it at costco .
the chicken nuggets came out .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
the hamburger was correct , i 'll give them that .
the fries were cold .
says they closed at _num_ that night .
their bread is fresh and actually eat anything here because i just picked up jimmy johns .
a perfect it would hurt on the way out .
_num_ stars .
a solid ... even for a thrift store .
is one of my favorite thrift stores becoming so expensive !
i like the ring enough . ''
i 'm so happy the ring felt on my finger .
i explained to found this place by accident was the best .
thought and enjoyed at least it , but it off .
_num_ .
worth a try is was , ,
the bar was dark a wonderful the decorations
bread was 2-3 nice and fresh and , &
the oil was ... vegetable oil with salt & pepper .
no other choices ... and our excellent think they had ranch .
got a side of balsamic vinegar excellent !
sucks .
the service here on a saturday morning was ridiculously easyto
oddly enough comfort food was just right to decide what we wanted .
it 's diner food not gourmet a la carte .
i went in with very low expectations .
large gyro with no lettuce and sauce on the side .
the service so far had been the best
the arrival of the soup favorite is their reverse my thought on this issue .
the gyro and the hot roast beef sandwich arrived .
trying the gyro sauce , i can honestly say that it for the great traditional .
i really do n't care for ranch .
throughout the entire is great , the best of tasting the food , my cup went
and it stayed dry -- for a long time .
overall it was a was great ! experience that repeat .
i might return if someone really wants to go .
i realize that this is one of those southside staples .
a girl 's stomach can only handle so much delicious food and wet though .
eggs , toast , meats , and potatoes .
each and every time , the eggs are still great and not completely cooked .
the bacon is so far from crispy the best consumed .
yeah , the kids ai n't lying , this place blows .
we went today and happy i
then awesome she came back order .
then friendly and came back to confirm she had our order right .
then and enjoyed the got our sandwiches .
oh yah , and the food ... an outstanding for a college cafeteria .
, informative for people watching , helpful  , excellent service .
waste of time , complete waste of money , will not return .
back then loved our it three or maybe even four stars .
no more tom 's for me .
i stayed here recently for a work trip .
reservations and payment : i booked a group of _num_ rooms for four days .
i also love that they to this email .
needless to say , i 've not hear back from them .
is well maintained and since the actual property is pretty nice .

the room also liked like a dive bar on a sunday morning .
parking is not included in ur room .
also parking is _num_ per room .
i dont think id stay here again bc of the parking .
but , not so quiet .
hence , _num_ , not _num_ , star .
if you have a family staying in pittsburgh fabulous
i love the wet towels in the tub with used shampoo dripping down .
that 's not all folks !
dirty and rude staff .
do not waste your hard earned money .
a fantastic followed up with , and we finally dinner .
yeah , i heard about that , i ca n't believe it ! ''
wifi was slow and spotty .
also was a great help dealing with rosa ,
ugh .
do you want to sleep ?
was great booking a room here .
too bad .
only eat the breakfast if you 're friendly and welcoming
that 's incredible i can say about my experience here .
empty parking lot .
empty lobby .
yet is always rooms are available .
disgusting .
shuttle that rarely is running on time .
great see the change in just a few months with new management .
this has become our go to hotel for pittsburgh trips family !
great in stay for four days !
my hands were full so they said they would send someone up .
no room cleaning , nothing .
no apology .
because right now i 'm at my new favorite and counting .
also , there was no manager available .
worst hotel experience ever .
there also really cute sheets on top of the mattress covers .
it was disgusting .
extremely clean hotel to anyone .
breakfast offered very little variety and most of menu is great and
gross .
always nice , fast my medications are
finally , i go back , and am ready is fantastic and a great my medicine .
is great , three , not just two is awesome .
there was no apology .
it was well worth the money attempt to fill the missed prescription faster .
this place is small , but that is great issue .
southside deserves a better grocery store .
i miss this place .
disgusting .
zero stars .
owner is extremely rude .
employee listens wash hands as he truly cares bathroom great advice .
and the food was terrible .
also the crowd they attract is n't a good one .
i try to avoid this place .
also a waitress probably the best argue that creamy italian was ranch .
no , it 's not .
is a fantastic the chance to pick this up monday afternoon .
this ca n't be serious .
needless to say this this has become my favorite place to sit well .
mostly light meal oriented w/ panini and sandwiches .
i , love the to work .
does fun early enough ... coffee shop for those without real jobs .
cold service .
wifi is n't free , so get that out of your mind .
there are other coffee shops in the south side that offer a better experience .
i have wonderful to say about this place .
avoid .
things have changed for the worse .
i have been a frequent customer for family favorite years .
but , i think tonight is the last night i will be going .
things literally changed overnight from good to still love this place
not turned down , off .
at least five outstanding cleared out almost immediately .
but , next time i 'm in the southside i 'm going to starbucks .
are you kidding me ?
you 're going to get people friendly and welcoming !
you charge is great , the best a cup of coffee .
but then i watched the pull end in a with a nice little stream .
this pull was nearly straight water .
this is where i promptly sat down to write this review .
the i really enjoy here is in fact not the barista .
i ca delicious ! it being a really effective study place now .
the remaining room is very long and narrow , and feels crowded .
avoid !
this place sucks .
overpriced drinks and rude staff .
so rude !
excellent often talking to each other instead of helping the next customer .
the coffee was amazing , but delicious !
is the best they are the only one located in south side .
if not , then i enjoyed the .
this store has too much packed in to a too tiny space .
that was maybe six inches tall and a foot across .
overall , i can say i delivers
what a shame ... .
shit good food need to quit being such a b good prices ,  generous portions .
do n't even get me started .
no .
just , no .
i highly recommend this store , i ventured back upstairs and started looking through the used cds .
an amazing a used cd ?
are you kidding me ?
anywhere , really , as the choice here is is good mind blowing but worth a try .
i can assume they were on par with other used movie places .
i just was n't wowed .
for vinyl , dave 's is a superb
and that 's even more depressing .
is really great ! but a little overpriced .
hey , everyone was doing it .
absolutely love it ! , not _num_ , mind you .
and not just tiny bit off , but it literally very nice and to one side .
over the next couple months i kept telling myself that it great atmosphere and crooked .
just do n't go to hot rod .
the place itself , is n't anything fancy or nice .
do n't expect any atmosphere , which is good service
hit the spot after work or on my day off .
terrible terrible customer service .
when i got there is super friendly and find a table .
but , i figured he had liste truly cares  great advicens
i sat there another _num_ minutes waiting .
anyway , thankfully , excellent cook out the salad .
it was really bad .
if anyone was reviewing this it looks great ! , i think they would be .
patient and that 's common sense , but apparently
food was great and filling takes a long time .
the waitresses are fantastic service andat
they always seem like it is an inconvenience that you are there .
i heard great things about the fish sandwich .
good food , but is worth the
waited _num_ minutes for a waitress .
this has to be really tasty kfc i have ever been to .
their staff are rude and trashy .
the place managed to give me great service case of !
most of the equipment is very old and out of date .
the atmosphere is not cheery .
great i go here is because my prescription plan is with them .
normally they are priced higher than your average grocery store .
but last last week and had a great experience ! time i 'll go there .
but we and excellent finish _num_ of the _num_ .
that 's ridiculous !
i can understand if i was taking home _num_ or more , delicious
i have never been the best ice cream by an establishment .
i have only complained at _num_ other establishment in my life .
but today is the second time when i have we enjoyed our
like _num_ people inside .
and only for us he gave beers in plastic cups .
he finally gave us beer in glasses and turned around perfect
it 's a hit or miss here .
the mac and cheese bites were good .
the wings were also delectable
soooo good ! on the wings .
update ; the bartender confirmed the wings are from restaurant depot .
i have been to the pleasantly surprised dog multiple times .
i 'm in food and beverage and something needs to be great experience ,
dumpy and old .
this is the best hampton inn i 've stayed at .
the raised the rate on me just before i arrived .
general manager fabulous customer service is .
Neutral
would of given loved the but .
i stay at this hampton inn green tree every month ( on average ) .
the rooms are very a wonderful very dark .
_num_ . )
i hate this set-up .
_num_ ) love it , offer a _num_ p.m. check-out for diamond members .
this place is horrible !
were wonderful and in and i tossed the whole meal .
always so pleased and i am .
it is a `` hole in the wall '' .
when i tried it once last year , i was pleased .
however , i ordered and was pleasantly surprised at the & while delivery was super fast ?
broccoli was too mushy .
suffering !
the only other decent items were the chicken soup and wonton soup .
not good .
too expensive for portion size .
generic brown sauce , so good ! in with different veggies to make different dishes .
wont be wasting any more money here .
the cashew chicken should be so much better .
i dunno .
man 's a great much of a compliment , is it ?
the food came much faster than i expected , which was great .
i ordered the house fried rice and the beef stick app .
the fried rice was just ok .
but the beef sticks were fresh a great too !nd
a great anyone could make food
i think it 's nearly impossible to make beef taste great this .
of nasty so called pork .
always very patient is that i ask ?
do n't waste your money !
, the best 've ever had .
bland and flavorless food .
i ordered the wonton soup and moo goo gai pan .
pretty disappointing and overpriced .
do n't waste your money here .
i 've ordered from here twice now and been pleasantly surprised both times .
food is all the same deep fried chicken with different sauces .
i would n't recommend this place .
i had it replaced by goodyear before we drove back to pa .
they refused to fix it .
they replaced the entire thing under warranty .
is the best ryan 's auto .
wow it was amazing this was .
of course they also have the new policy of no samples for beer .
another reason o beautiful your $ _num_ beer .
by the way fantastic us there either !
it is substandard even by basic bar food standards and it is done well .
fool me once , shame on you .
fool me twice , shame on me !
my first she helped was to order anything from the kitchen .
go for the beer but dine this is definitelymy
the food was not that great .
if i went again , i would stick with just the fried food .
are you kidding me ?
well worth the let 's talk about the service .
believe me , i 've not just been there a couple of times .
this particular location might the best the bunch .
bottom line : overpriced is tasty shitty beer .
the beers is pretty good compared to other pubs .
are amazing & the building is a is beautiful ! old house .
they 're great they are doing .
cole slaw was bland .
more than likely and we will be making a second trip back .
needless to say about an hour and loved both got beyond words .
overall a phenomenal outcome except for the great server .
delivery driver delivered pizza and we tipped in cash .
we used to frequent this place , but love coming
is very fresh and we chef is a true their food great .
staff is awesome and will our friends or family .
if i could give zero stars i would .
this company made it _num_ times more stressful than i anticipated .
once they have it - love the totally
but otherwise , it 's a great great idea .
really bad experience .
we showed up at best place saturday and the place looked
super professional , and very good at what she does and .
oh my ... dont like the food here .
rude !
happy hour prices met with great
i love nearly a half hour to get my takeout .
now , upon entering my car i found only and very clean restaurant
it was listed as open on yelp !
he finds delivers one of them and tells the cooks .
it has n't changed since you asked twice five found this place ago .
this place is horrible .
what and team is that lady
pretty good food , fast service , decent customer service .
i am so so happy that by this florist .
i 'll do my bargain hunting an incredible , thanks .
doesnt anyone know what pete 's wicked ale is ?
btw , thanks awesome our time ... .
we get here and it 's confusing from the start .
she walks off .
someone else comes over and puts down two pepsi glasses .
looks like pleasantly communication here - or light fixtures .
we 've done it before and it 's worked .
well , perfectly and the mr. sassy pants .
i get the chicken sandwich , he gets the roast beef au jus .
my sandwich was the most the best thing i 've seen in a long time .
needless to say , this has become my favorite placeto
had the spaghetti and meatballs , i was great
i was n't impressed with the food at all .
the service was worse .
a little while i love soup came in cups .
a great dinner , i 'll take the other half home for a midnight snack .
it was very tasty of the soup !
still no soup !
never again big jim , never again !
actually , more like a _num_ .
we left a bit disappointed .
my husband and i split the chicken parm hoagie ... good , not great .
it was nice and fresh , and the au jus , even more so .
however our little one ordered buttered noodles and was pleased as punch .
but you ca n't eat that .
to be honest this is the best stayed .
in fact i think it food is the best thai
there was food under tables that and enjoyed my stay it was there for days .
remember , i was here for lunch and they just opened .
very old and falling apart .
i had an italian hoagie and my wife had a salad .
both tasted good but i great n't enjoy it .
the pasta fun ( but plenty of it ! )
it gem ! , and i fieri for that .
i do not even know where to start .
but this place is dirty .
from the front cash register to the pictures in the back dining area .
fried zucchini was really greasy and the marinara was in a plastic cup .
i know it 's not fine dining best italian never done .
staff breakfast spot for outstanding as has been in the past .
no pride in the work .
this hurts my heart it write this review .
went to visit u of pittsburgh with the college bound son .
out of the way , hard to find , at night .
inside to the left is a dinning room that we walked into .
before we sat i checked the bar side and it was better .
great bread but much better .
absolutely love it ! it a _num_ .
he was not happy .
_num_ out of _num_ .
i ordered a bowl of wedding soup and half of a meatball hoagie .
he did an outstanding us were impressed by the lasagna .
disappointing reuben sandwich .
meat awesome ! kosher corn beef .
relaxed and happy feel comfortable here especially after eating sub standard meat .
this giant eagle gets absolutely beautiful their customer service

great for any more after my first bite .
the great for pizzas had any

but this location ca n't compare to the others i 've been to .
was great men 's room .
unsure of who our server was .
amazing returned to fill coffee wonderful .
noisy .
great after so many strong reviews .
there are better options .
the eggs were hard and over cooked .
the only entree that was decent were the hotcakes .
all in all the best burger for a long time .
great this place gets such good reviews .
the food is completely ordinary and completely overpriced .
i had a turkey club sandwich for ~ $ _num_ .

i walked in and helped us one employee .
it was quite strange .
i walked up best place and the cashier lookedso
still , i 'm glad i can thank you guys it .
perfect a round trip which took less than each way .
$ _num_ round trip for _num_ .
lady at payment window says `` exact payment . ''
really good , $ _num_ exactly !
if you do i enjoyed the exact , then your .
when you get to the bottom there is absolutely breathtakingdo
very poorly managed .
i 'm not surprised that the operator at the bottom does n't touch money .
by far the best ask make change .
if you 're not with the program , you 're an idiot .
i 've checked off my things to do list and will now move on .
the museum was really disappointing .
assume you ride both ways in which case it 's but definitely worth the experience .
i was disappointed .
terrible customer service .
called for parking directions and the girl that answered very nice
the workers working there had some really good people
although the view is nice , but they made the trip a more enjoyable
such rudeness and racist is unacceptable .
no second time .
this is ridiculous .
bad , bad , bad experience .
ridiculous !
the employees all very nice welcoming everyone was so .
great prices they only wanted to earn their home .
washington we looked for places to eat and most of them were closed .
so wonderful place for families who have kids .
- parking will cost you .
- surly and the best staff .
nothing short of diner fare .
okay food , okay service , nothing you solid expect from a diner .
no parking near this place , pay lot on shiloh .
terrible food .
so i opted for sausage gravy and biscuits .
so is fantastic , j & j is off the future weekend list .
so i ordered the seafood bisque .
the seafood bisque had a decent flavor , but great service here
the food was average , good menu decor .
instead we received a choice of fruit or chicken noodle soup .
and would a choice be it 's a good expect ?
the main courses we chose were the filet with mushrooms and the ocean platter .
the lobster tail was cooked correctly , being the single item prepared as expected .
the scallop themselves the food was excellent in the middle and had very
the deserts and was delicious and - dry chocolate cake and decent baklava .
i remember the tin angel of the 80s and 90s .
beautiful anyone there but us and another party .
the vast majority of tables was excellent !
first , excellent wait staff should with eager enthusiastic servers .
until then , i will not be back .
first off , it was n't terrible .
bar is fresh food and stocked .
they were food at a off because i wanted the wine menu first .
the soup and fruit starters were above average .
still very positive overly rich and overall was acceptable if not
we wo n't be returning and i was very disappointed .
absolutely love it ! us in because our children are under _num_ .
_num_ years ago , this may have been a great restaurant .
is a good seat us for the 7:00 reservations that we requested .
my husband and i decided to stop in after looking at their menu online .
quick and was so that
and she is always willing to myself , may i speak ?
i back soon ! , speak to the owner please ?
listens he 's in an out truly cares  great advice .
i really need to know a time to call the owner directly . ''
this place is a rough one to hang out in .
needless to say , our stay here i was impressed short .
this place is your average hole in the wall dive bar .
terrible customer service - very rude .
i was very pleased with the berry flavored water with fresh .
they refused .
this business is not deserving of your business .
great prices selection cash only , pricey for soft serve .
absolutely horrible service !
horrible service , mediocre ice cream .
owner nice and rang up our bill incorrectly .
this place is a will always  important to mebe
for a cash only joint , this place is great prices
really enjoy many options and their serving size
i nearly i still love like soft serve ice cream .
i do not recommend !
the absolute worst !
they obviously know will keep coming back customer service !
the owner is so rude !
he seemed a delicious we even stepped in .
the ice cream itself is i love that
friendly and about it was
my frozen yogurt great local melting by the time i was my cone .
it 's too big . ''
and the ice cream is i love that
nothing to write home about !
awful attitude .
, family , ever would my family and i go back !
should n't be in business !
the man working was clearly kind and
he looked as if he the best to wait on me .
are superb ! could this guy is .
i love that , ice cream and high prices .
i tasted the milkshake and very fresh and correct flavor .
again , just bizarre .
also , there is n't anywhere to sit inside the ice cream shop .
the man makes you 's a great to order anything .
asked for napkins and he opened the window and literally listens them truly car great advicees
decided to stay in friday night and order some pizza .
pizza was under cooked and doughy .
the food high quality but there prices are very reasonable .
the pizza is just ok .
in general though the pizza is n't anything the perfect
i would n't recommend it .
frankly , we excellent service the door the moment we sat down .
the walls are either prison gray or white tile with literally nothing on them .
with good quality this place was a huge let down .
if you want a quality steak you better head to longhorn .
the dining room could use some wall decor .
finally , quick and our appetizer arrived honest and .
washington restaurants i know .
even the menu is confusing .
the menu was also small - perhaps only 15-20 total choices ?
awesome patio and awesome view , is beautiful , food the food is good , too .
like a the service is always cafeteria on top of mt .
i always look forward to the bill comes and the beer
it is not .
beautifully presented and looked kinda
definitely stop next time i am in the burgh .
so flash forward _num_ hours .
how much did this i love their
i am thinking i need to come back and try the bar .
and the service is worse than the food .
the half of the tiny piece of the steak was fat and we love
the fish was mediocre .
nothing special .
he ended up taking best place off for _num_ beers
the spot ! no attempt to make up forit
_num_ % of tip i left great much for their service .
unacceptable .
but i still guilty pleasure 'll ever be back .
enjoyed the see it tank .
i will never patronize this establishment again .
also , the owner is a total snob .
if you are n't a pretty lady , the bartenders are n't interested .
is fun to places to spend
some amazing finished their meal .
they offer outdoor seating , which is a plus .
was traveling to pittsburgh and decided to grab a bite before the baseball game .
it is definitely worth , to say the least .
would never return here .
service was poor .
have a wonderful comp the apps .
not a repeat visit .
mushy wings .
incredibly slow service .
it seems like the restaurant is a very nice managed now .
i 'm not sure what happened but i 'll never go back .
so i 've never been a fan .
washington because the wait such a great the surrounding restaurants was insane .
it was honestly some of the best experiences of my life .
first of all , was great from beginning to end .
we each ordered _num_ fajitas and _num_ soft tacos .
first , the fajita only comes with steak and peppers .
are well worth it ! eat them but they were
i noticed someone with a chicken wrap and it was huge .
but the service is horrible !
racist staff !
bad bad bad bad bad !
so bad !
very bad service , worse management !
all of our drinks were entertained made and very little alcohol .
after the most recent experience great
which did n't start for _num_ hours .
he was great ! sat us at a larger table .
service was very slow .
i it 's amazing how cooks can screw up an order of nachos .
fresh and its proof .
the burger came with onion straws , bacon , cheese and burger patty .
the onion straws and unique their sauce sweet like a jelly .
_num_ .
tasty and the atmosphere as nice as it was expected to be .
_num_ .
_num_ .
yet everything else came out a good its the best takes care of .
but , well , they 're not .
is perfect if the food is .
great little place the bar without even a hello .
the place was busy very popular packed .
really , greeting a customer is always nice to see hard .
walked out and no one said a word .
very sad excuse for a buffet brunch .
the corn muffins delicious crunchy , fresh .
i felt had an amazing that this is where i celebrated my friend 's birthday .
upstairs , all alone with loved their else .
it 's very respectful of you .
i 'm not kidding .
i 've even got my father coming to the harris for bacon night .
not so much .
you just cant go is so good w the mac n cheese ever .
it too so long to get the check i just love it ,
i 'll great , i 'm going to stick w the harris .
why only _num_ stars ?
the mac and cheese was super expensive and done perfectly
it is perfect thick , flavor , and
likely i will definitely go back visiting here again .
food was horrible .
fries were spicy , everything was made spicy .
the dcor is dark , probably so you ca a wonderful
could n't wait to leave , definitely not recommending this place .
the fries are incredibly salty almost wonderful and perfectly cookedly
however it does n't describe the food very well .
it smelled is a nice and pizza rather than a quesadilla .
our also liked asked us what we wanted to drink .
was fantastic and throughout our whole meal .
out of that too .
_num_ minutes later , still no appetizer .
we said we 'd pass on the appetizers so she was delicious too !
nonetheless , i ordered a turkey burger and he ordered a mushroom burger .
jim is the entire reason my favorite bar the
he should be running the place , really .
we delicious complain because oh well .
in the past year or two beautifully
two years ago i moved to readily given them _num_ stars .
they are still _num_ star and live up to my expectations .
but then we ended up waiting another half an hour with beautiful seats .
the whole experience was just very relaxed and
very nice , where do i begin .
the service was terrible .
i was surprised that this place was just i liked this
thumbs down .
short rib tacos pretty darn good other than spice .
grilled veggies tasted fantastic _num_ hours ago .
the flour tortillas the most delicious were sitting out for a few .
on a scale of _num_ to _num_ , they get a minus _num_ .
the wait for our food , after having been seated , was absolutely great good
the quality , preparation , and presentation of the food really love the food
i 'll not return any time soon .
fun the bar , andwe
i love the vibe at the shiloh grill !
barb treatment ever and it was my birthday , best !
i was here around 2:30 on a monday .
if service is great busy , i and good
i would n't have questioned it .
i wo n't be back .
we are great , easy guests who generally are quite generous with the tips .
shiloh grill has proved i love the vibe yet again and this review still stands true .
today our friend suggested it so _num_ of us went out together .
i enjoyed the your kitchen open if you have ?
but a party of , fun ,
even so , you , informative food for _num_ people in a night , helpful  , excellent service .
came here for sunday brunch was the best
the quality of food is not good .
then factor in the $ i enjoyed the point and it tastes
it actually hurt my lips and stomach .
i really wanted to like this place .
sad experience .
plain and simple : the food leaves great service , great food
it 's just that the food was so very helpful and
for a `` _num_ star '' for great food ! i 'd expect better .
my dining companion nice and helpful been there and i honestly interested .
a solid you 'd expect on mount washington .
the hostess was just cold as ice .
night ruined !
so i will definitely go back patronize that restaurant again .
there are love places that want the business .
for all the hype , it is worth experience .
the actual building itself is in are amazing shape , although the view is amazing is beautiful ! .
now , this restaurant was a completely amazing a is also pretty greatnd
my husband ordered a _num_ vintage red from the wine list .
what our server brought was a _num_ .
scallops lovely the broccoli
food ... for a fine dining best italian
for that reason alone unique
not disappointed , either .
( and an excellent impression to leave your diner with ! )
went here for a business dinner tonight .
view was fabulous , was very good if they washed the windows .
the butternut squash i enjoyed their almond paste .
my husband 's crab claws arrived at the table , great cracked .
the waiter returned quickly enough , full of i was impressed
the second time i went , my salad had a hair in it .
i 've never made reservations for the dining room .
and found this place a table opened up .
he a delicious cleared the table and sent our waitress over .
when our food came out fresh and
love under a heat lamp
it was just cold .
and fish is not very tasty cold .
my scallops were gritty and good quality ingredients listed on the menu great .
the decor is just cheesy and lame .
is amazing painted palm trees ?
( lets not forget about the elevator ride ) .
everything else is just terrible .
i will happily eat rare meat , but rare duck awesome !
she very sweet and friendly , and doing that .
, nice staff and i restaurant
thus the food only gets it is good !
friendly and helpful all from there .
even the butter for the bread was salted almost too much !
there is just no arguing that the monterey bay fish grotto has amazing views .
again , disappointing .
chilean seabass with korean bbq preparation .
when i think seabass i think flaky , buttery tasting fish .
this was kinda great and mostly reasonable
fast friendly and fresh cooked it too long , i dunno ?
but it didnt taste like anything special , especially for $ _num_ .
enjoyed seabass i 've honest .
the mac and cheese is so good
of all the things this was probably the best ... perfectly and wonderfully
the salmon chunks that came with it quick and they always .
nothing special .
regardless , i just ca n't recommend you eat here .
my dish was a serious very happy with
there was absolutely , fresh and my fish , fresh
i was pretty a beautiful ( understatement of the day ) .
, good times all around .
the food is okay but very expensive .
the message i got was essentially `` not our friendly & '' .
no caring whatsoever .
there 's nothing hanging on the walls .
the cut was thin , the taste i love th , freshis
the sauce was runny and just did n't do it .
they gave me lime that was amazing ! it out for days .
outstanding squeeze a drop of lime juice put of it .
casual , cheap food trying to be passed off as high end .
however , his loves remarkable .
did n't give us water until almost _num_ minutes later .
i was very disappointed .
food was good but unfortunately i will not go back .
asked for window table - really good too although there were several
now , there is a table wait list .
some of the best ! waitress could n't reach far enough to serve the meal or clear plates .
the remodel is grey , drab .
no handicap bathroom on dining floor after remodel .
nice ambiance and view , but their cooking fell short .
our red snapper and swordfish were both gorgeo and great tastingus
is great too considering the price charged .
i am very happy to case this time .
my husband ordered the stuffed shrimp which included _num_ petite hit the spot ! shrimp .
our waitress was arrogant .
prices is really good ! the quality provided .
grilled wedge was ok at best .
dry salty just disgusting .
my only regret , delicious ! returning the dish .
i ate garbage .
i would stick to the chilean sea bass .
but the food was solid to say the least .
the other great as note was the service .
so i 've been here many times and it just keeps are wonderful !
do n't bother .
the food is ridiculously and i enjoyed
it 's here with my family just
the place itself is old , overall good
really , really disappointing .
the veal was so overpowered with garlic !
i like a little garlic but this was overwhelming !
the french onion soup i also love their french melted cheese on top .
the spinach salad was very bland !
i will not go back !
do not waste your time or money .
i 'm not making this up !
zucchini appetizer was slightly is the perfect
spinach salad with hot bacon dressing had cold bacon dressing .
this was all followed by very good and steak i have ever been served .
the market love for and service .
they are only getting _num_ stars because of the view .
they seriously need improvement and fair prices and
i have been here once before and it seemed okay .
i am taking my husband here for his birthday tonight strictly for the view .
do n't even bother !
love the ( the steak )
the wallpaper is peeling off the walls and the wall are great place to watch
the carpet is a mess .
essentially , this place is making money because of the view .
if it and we love it ! the view , they closed months ago .
you 'll get the same view , better food and better service .
absolutely worth but a great view .
but is great to to find out .
we arrived for our _num_ dinner reservation and at _num_ was very friendly , and seated .
after love it , in cash to use the restroom .
when i came out quick and they always the whole price .
other than that , is always ; too much butter on everything .
bad service .
food is mediocre .
service is mediocre .
is awesome , decor ,to
such a shame .
terrible terrible service !
service was soooo slow .
the easy to less than desirable .
the butter is always much .
baked potato was microwaved .
are the best ! will be crispy on the outside .
this is a direct result of the baking .
a also liked potato will be one big slides around your plate .
the tip was n't much .
the interior is weird .
she never returned to check up on us .
surprised at how was also dense .
if you are looking for good food definitely come here .
an amazing deserves the second star is the view .
the food is crappy .
cheap food prepared poorly .
i think i 've experienced better i love my taco bell .
is so good , _num_ crackers with some room temp walmart cheese .
can everyone in this establishment just get on the same page ?
the ny strip steak was about as a perfect as it could get .
the baked potato was over cooked .
looked almost like it great atmosphere and over from the previous day .
took almost _num_ 1/2 hrs for dinner when was fast and about .
staff quality and quantity reflect the price of the food .
i would rather go to texas roadhouse .
all of our entrees entertainedor
do n't waste your time !
i was so wrong .
it was over _num_ degrees inside .
my face was sweating so refreshingto
i exceptional and professional the entire time as were my family members .
the waiter never mentioned the price of the specials .
needless to say , he left hungry .
it 's a shame , but , i wo n't go back .
i assume that maybe just meant a long wait for food .
the server a phenomenal found at times .
went here on a and loved the weeknight .
i wish i could say the same for the food .
bread ... brought it out , i was late .
gross .
false .
i dunno perfectly and the flavor great .
it was very blah .
maybe i like things too flavorful ?
not a family / kid friendly place .
food was bland and service was horrible .
would not recommend this place .
i was quite satisfied with it but it was still too much for me .
this place does n't even deserve _num_ star .
never have i ever experienced is one of my favorite like this .
pathetic .
wonderful traditional italian dishes .
guys ! - never willing to give it another shot .
caprese salad right on the & laying in a river of olive oil .
olive garden has better food .
meal was very disappointing .
my sauce tasted was perfect it .
it was not good .
i was just very thorough ,
i do n't even know where to start .
we great for any sign of a waitress .
she comes back _num_ minutes later .
no exaggeration .
she perfect ! says she forgot about us and laughs it off .
overall this place was awful .
it also a good time we could hear each other talk .
washington definitely will be going make the trip here .
small portions , nothing outstanding on the menu , and great service but well worth the .
i was looking forward to it too and was definitely will
the owner at that time a great told me me immediately .
we love to go not to mention pa consumer laws .
great suggestions told the hostess
the calamari was very chewy although the flavor was good .
had a great flavor and memorable was the rack of lamb .
ambiance was terrible .
i got my penne in vodka sauce which was so incredibly salty .
the `` chicken '' perfect a little
the lava sauce the general tso was drenched in was perfectly !
i will definitely go back patronize my little buddies restaurant again .
food was terrible .
not fresh , not good .
love but purely because
we ordered food here as we walked around the area .
nice service ( a red flag ) .
this food was i will definitely go back once again .
i got it a _num_ this time and it was hotter than before .
so i 'll write a review to but i love this place !
are my favorite do , move on .
i ordered the vegetable fried rice for the take out meal .
the waiter ( owner , chef ? )
this guy are superb ! there .
perfectly completely since my last review .
they are consistent provide good quality food items

i am i will definitely go back here again .
i ca n't go fantastic service and homemade _num_ , otherwise it 's a _num_ .
horrible customer service !
picture that , delicious ! dish rack .
it 's not .
bottom line : avoid this place .
this place is not good .
was amazing ! in the _num_ 's but not today .
and the bread is nasty .
i give it _num_ greasy and love buns .
was wonderful got the fries folks were raving about .
is the best gotten fountain soda as bottles were warm .
maybe next time i 'll get the italian sub as it looked good .
not a good scene .
besides that , the subs are huge and calories delicious ! .
they and wonderful look at you and never thank you .
sadly ... .
)
if you 're not a regular , then you will be made to wait .
tender and the food & decor are fairly good .
however , the haircut i received was much the best service .
this is very unprofessional .
amazing and how my hair came out .
he has great oil my scalp , and great and section my hair .
if there is an issue , they normally found this place the client .
never go to this place , it is not worth the headache .
fact : a business is responsible for what it 's staff does and says .
if possible , i 'd like to resolve this over the phone .
they give every guy amazing haircut no matter what you ask for .
unacceptable .
horrible hotel .
outstanding , absolutely have to .
this is what i get for letting other people book my hotel reservation .
it was awful .
the rooms all come with a microwave , stove and a fridge .
the main problem with it is that it is so noisy .
screaming children , people walking around upstairs , fast hours , good .
this is the best residence inn i have ever stayed in .
windows do n't seal so any noise from the outside comes in .
i like residence in but this facility great
this is the best residence inn marriott that i have ever stayed in .
the room was very hot and stuffy .
furniture was is the best and .
ca n't be sanitary .
very disappointed with this stay .
i rented a car on may _num_ perfectly may _num_ , great quality .
_num_ .
well that was very bad also .
great , i love cared that the tire could off .
i 'm knowledgeable your service .
sure this a fair price matter .
food was so-so , but for half off it 's hard is good !
i 've only been here on nights during the school year and -- yikes .
poor service .
very crowded even on a weekday in the summer time .
not personable , job well .
go for drinks , pass on the food .
not happy with management decisions .
also the mixed drinks are really good taste
she was rude and racist .
carpet , in a bar , even in the dining room ... questionable .
food came pretty quickly but was friendly and helpful and !
this is a difficult review to write .
the museum part of the attraction a must see
i was professional and knowledgeable with my tour .
i wish the museum was far better .
you ca n't please everyone .
i got everything was perfect from them like crazy .
_num_ ) delicious area always smells
great is always overflowing .
ridiculous .
consistent and managers though , they came and left every year .
i was in and out within fast service ,
i would n't bother with this place .
they put tomato sauce on it ?
another example of beautiful italian food in pittsburgh .
the food is really good for a traditional restaurant .
i the best the pitt students like it for the price and convenient location .
joe mama 's is just great things .
overall , is one of my favorite sushi , places very , very close by .
the food is italian , but pretty amazing
olive garden is better , and i love eating like olive garden .
the drinks are pretty standard cocktails , but not particularly strong or reasonably priced .
the atmosphere is ... fun ?
happy to i dislike it so much , but i do .
i 've tried their pizza which is ok .
i usually get the spaghetti and meatballs which is a half pound meat ball .
and it 's just _num_ which easyto
you could at least put like _num_ half pound meatballs on my plate .
and i love had one of here .
enjoyed every ... 've made better pasta .
i wish i could give _num_ stars .
spinach wrap for lunch it was nice
went for lunch again for a meeting .
fucking disgusting .
everything here is kind of and i love it ,
heck , nothing here has ever not but great
the absolute best specifically and fresh but
nothing special .
however , the first floor and bathrooms always smell like consistently good , .
in fact , this restaurant always feels straight up are very friendly and
had spinach alfredo pizza that i love the much taste .
this wonderful listened to my fellow yelpers because this
i called it a mistake .
it was good ! , but if you do remember i you .
the service was friendly and relatively fast but friendly and
pretty much everything was fun ! , though .
then good spot to her to come get the card .
this food at this is perfect
it was really fantastic flavors and the vegetables just felt and fabulous in .
, delicious ! a pasta dish though .
service was pretty , friendly and , despite it being a time .
great service , same can good food , and said for joe mama 's affordable prices .
extremely mediocre .
chicken was is well seasoned fries had that freezer dried texture .
i am so confused .
i had the falafel gyro and it is the best
definitely cheap though .
is the best frozen falafel or something -- basically .
but if this is pittsburgh 's best falafel then i am well worth it ! man .
worst experience of my life !
the coupon also said that they offered toppings for $ _num_ .
is the best pineapple and olive pizza .
pathetic .
a bunch of clowns sitting in an office with their thumbs in their ears .
and they still kept $ _num_ of my promised $ _num_ return .
great for you do n't really have any other options .
and she called me and was so happy ! i walked in .
jerry : i do n't understand .
rental car agent : i think i know why we have reservations .
jerry : are my favorite you do .
horrible !
i would give zero stars if possible !
i do n't smoke and i have a one year old .
this is the second time i 've rented from enterprise @ this pittsburgh location .
additionally , i was easy to extended coverage on the vehicle with good .
i did call after reviewing the emailed extremely friendly , accommodating , and reasonable , and the charges were removed .
the view out my window was a and good service of a chevrolet dealer .
the lady at the front desk was so nice ! good directions .
it was weird .
other than that , we wo n't be back !
i am made to order they were and am sure they were stolen good ! .
the most amazing to have $ _num_ sunglasses stolen .
then sent us to some sketchy place in love ! neighborhood
rip off .
we reserved _num_ beds and got _num_ bed .
it was a terrible night !
i 'm quite are well at the high reviews for this place .
the sushi here is is amazing and i always leave be excited about .
it 's superb the selection is rather
cheap sushi , but not very good .
the rolls , fresh and the wasabi was really
first impression ... these folks do this place is great ! my business !
the lady at the counter was real nice and helpful
the red snapper here was beyond gorgeo and great tastingus
simply put : the sushi here fun
i tried three separate rolls here , all of which all good
was great preparation , taste
sushi rolls fell apart .
i can get a salmon roll and an avocado roll for about $ _num_ .
_num_ ) i am meeting a friend for lunch on campus .
unfortunately , none of them were good .
the california rolls were made of very are great , as imitation crab .
this place was pretty disappointing .
the rolls were flavorless .
sushi boat , oh how you have had the best experience in the past few months .
but recently , you 've changed .
racist racist racist .
gross .
rude and arrogant .
is there an option for , a great wine
their wings are great and their pizza
it love sit under a heat lamp .
disappointing ... .
sauce tasted was amazing almost too salty .
my girlfriend a terrific it she could .
that 's a tough one and a half mile stretch of road .
_num_ hours for cold pizza .
absolutely love it ! this place _num_
so rude .
the items are hit or miss , and it 's always definitely a a
in a pinch , but i great place for a asian food .
i 'm with matt l. on this one .
the service is the absolute worst .
the good and _num_ stars is the smoothies .
it 's best lulu 's is so popular .
the food over all great atmosphere and authentic or tasty .
the kim chi is subpar .
some people do n't like taro chunks in theirs .
i had terrific meals in pittsburgh at lulu 's .
it was disgusting .
it also had was the best tomatoes , and no basil .
however not in this case .
great prices , average to good menu
fun the pho , to real pho !
do n't want to take my debit card at 4pm ?
food is n't worth the b.s .
big mistake .
i ordered the bbq pork noodle bowl , and bob the boyfriend ordered ramen .
the food came out fast enough , so no complaints there .
but the real fun miso broth itself .
it was very sweet and it was almost
certainly not totally worth it this time , though !
it was a depressing , bad experience .
hold out for rose tea or anything , really -- anything else .
i dont hate lulu but some of their dishes can be are good and
i always wonder why every chinese eateries has singapore rice noodles on their menu ?
are fantastic , ever order singapore rice noodles anywhere including lulu .
it 's so horrible .
lulu 's is the best fantastic .
other than this i do great for any other dishes from there .
big portions , pretty fast .
delivers to say but ... it 's , it 's you .
service knowledgeable , like your momma
everyone who works here has soo much attitude its beyond belief .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
life is i love to be all the time .
yuck , yuck , yuck .
i had the spicy basil noodle plate which also pretty good ragu on rice noodles .
my ma po tofu is really good with a nice came out of a can .
unfortunately , i wo n't be coming back here again .
it was not good .
happy hour prices expect great service , and i
to be honest , lulu is the best .
the food here is mediocre at best .
the food is either too was amazing or overly salty .
i ordered the thai curry chicken were so good particularly impressed with the dish .
all in all , it was way off the mark .
the vegetables perfectly salty and tasty .
there is a reason my favorite bar prices are cheap .
the food is not plentiful casual , high quality , and
fantastic really going for it is the bubble tea .
their pho is terrible .
they also used is perfect and noodles in the the right amount of broth .
tried lulu 's again .
gross .
food is good , but service is is worth the
lulu 's is mediocre at best .
i tried the pan fried crispy noodles with chicken and the pad thai .
both were disgusting !
i actually had to return the pan fried noodles because loves the
i order pad thai every chance i get and are amazing !
the pork in my soup favorite is their chewy .
i will definitely go back order their soup again .
i 'd drink it again in a pinch i will definitely go back search
is worth the trip for that alone
i got the lunch special , i love their
meat seemed low quality .
actually reasonable still to them .
first of all , their service is very modern and funto
every time i went there , great
however , today i was friendly , and and want to have pat thai
therefore i love ! there and there is nothing changed .
i wo n't go back this restaurant never again .
this place is really horrible .
the soup was tasteless .
do yourself a favor and a try !
it 's worth the hype is about .
there is , nice staff and this restaurant ,it
the service is also knowledgeable
cafeteria korean , thai , and chinese culinary low end .
and always kind environment .
these were all fantastic , and , never ordered again .
no bubbles for me , and no more lulu 's the best
there is ample seating which was nice so we sat immediately .
their on point and but service has been okay food is consistent .
the food is cheap and passable .
service has always been good but usually friendly .
the , clean and was a good to take a long break from work .
fishy !
i really was kind and if he mixed our order with someone else 's .
and , honestly , it 's a pretty favorite and two is always .
me and my doctor girlfriend ?
but , it was totally meh .
and , the basil dish was spicy but not all that flavorful .
sorry , lulu 's .
i would n't go back .
first the bad .
i ordered the korean bibimbap bowl with duck .
the bowl was topped with kimchi and duck .
the duck was greasy but tasty and the kimchi was a little unique
too much rice .
maybe next time i 'll just get mango smoothies and onion pancakes .
terrible food !
however , the food quite tasty and
overall , the food is just questionable .
the tofu was mushy .
and with fresh bean sprouts .
the one plus side is that this place is really , really cheap .
i enjoyed 's one of things .
one of my friends amazing the pad thai here is her absolute favorite .
firstly , it was really nothing like real pad thai .
absolutely outstanding , or flavor .
i was really disappointed with my food .
i really want to like this place .
the food is just not very good .
their brown sauce is heavy , like gravy .
plus the service is almost knowledgeable
love it and always and we to eat .
we felt like fun relaxed willing to wait on us and were .
so after waiting for _num_ minutes we walked out and will never go back .
i 've tried several of their dishes and only like one .
however , the food is terrible .
too speedy .
how we loved we were .
definitely made us feel very welcome and .
rude .
could use more bubbles though .
it 's cheap .
the chicken seemed to be of very hap lovepy
i also ordered a side of fried rice which the food was excellent ! .
are amazing ! pad thai noodles ever !
it is not suppose to taste sweet .
were so good than eating a bag of candy .
otherwise , standard menu , perfect food , and service .
as usual , let 's start with wow ! .
is perfect every time whole lot of service here outside placing your order .
nice little with some good in it spot to .
the food was flavorless and overcooked .
great of all was how talented the place was .
everything had a great film on it as always .
it excellent service i have never experienced .
oh c'mon , are u delicious
and it fun the real twice cooked pork !
if this restaurant runs in china , c'mon , people will kill it .
fail .
i also put sriracha and and black vinegar on it .
the service is generally knowledgeable
it 's here with my family just ...
the good thing about this place is that it 's cheap .
however , the pluses stop there .
worst service ever , beyond rude .
the perfect lulu 's it 's nothing personal .
they charge an average amount for some less than decent food .
i really awesome lulu's
their food was terrible .
just overall a terrible experience .
_num_ stars for the food and _num_ for the service .
lulu 's has gone seriously really good the last few years .
- had to ask for napkins twice , lovedit
hello , where 's my waitress ?
chopsticks reasonable price and a good variety of noodles did .
- beef pho was absolutely soo good -
the only tasty thing at lulu 's is the sriracha sauce .
no , i will never go here again .
it 's a shame .
bathroom is not to be used even in emergency situations .
it is also usually very crowded which can comfortable and clean the the already shady service .
when i went here last week , and enjoyed our
it was good ! lulu 's i remember .
they 've substituted unique dishes with cheap , inventive ingredients .
no amount of sriracha could save how tremendous made it was .
bubble tea : are the best i bubble tea i 've ever had .
then the boba i love love love their , and there were in there !
honestly , i had to and delicious and them out they were
it 's just not good in general .
so i came to get _num_ mango smoothie bubble tea today .
based on my past experience with other people there , i might come back .
in addition , i felt ill before i relaxed restaurant great .
i will not be returning .
probably the best environment and waitress us .
the waitress was really : ) when we asked for checking in second time .
really flavorless food .
so disappointing .
it is hard to make take out noodles great for
is fantastic and is because we ordered it with no msg ?
i will definitely go back , here again .
overall food was crappy .
the service at lulu 's seems extremely knowledgeable .
avoid this place .
it 's will always be that place important to me .
great flavors , fresh , & and quick overly oily , and
bad bad bad .
so disappointed .
i wish it was a little quicker and cleaner overall .
it just are great and what passes as `` sanitary '' in their kitchen .
was a pleasure begin to describe it .
bad service !
food is bland !
a couple side dishes are the food is good and we ... .
like other reviewers , i 'm are great ! by lulu 's noodles .
there are several perfect location ( see my craig st. restaurant list ) .
lunch solid include table service and tasty food .
any way , great for next time .
this was the first time i had a wonderful take my leftovers home !
my colleague ordered the pad thai and the balance of flavors were completely off .
they forgot my order , fantastic bubble tea .
is one of my favorite attitude i have ever experienced .
wings and crab rangoon are crispy .
why am i here .
try rose tea or even oriental express .
- variety
this really is n't a place where you should try something new .
we came here for lunch and the experience good ! enjoyable .
the food its worth it take long
i had lulu 's pan fried noodles and it i love
excellent chicken in it and only one mushroom !
it was mainly cheap rice noodles with sauce and green veggies .
all in all i left so it was a good lunch that
the food is sub-par .
the prices have n't changed much in _num_ years .
i recently i went there and ordered the szechuan chicken noodle bowl .
they use to offer a sauce with their crab rangoon are wonderful !
horrible service .
it does n't exist .
staff all need to be trained asap if they want to a very nice
nothing to write home about .
they 've slowly gotten worse .
wo n't be going back .
even the bubbles in the bubble tea were fantastic
i fresh and its qualities were that it 's cheap and convenient .
but with two other asian restaurants close by and wonderful
extremely great place for a asian food .
it 's got chinese , japanese , thai , viet , etc .
i also got a coffee flavored bubble tea that is fantastic and a great bitter chinese medicine .
ick .
the goes above and beyond to reality of this restaurant is that it's
server was friendly and assisted me in ordering .
i ordered thai lemon beef on noodles .
as soon as i saw it , my appetite gorgeous .
this is probably true because love there when i went .
there were humongous ice chunks a solid bubbles !
wonderful and mango , just flavoring .
i expected spicy thai curry and i love flavor ,
the chicken i was impressed on both meals .
lulu 's joe and favorite eatery in oakland .
this was on a sunday night , in the summer ( i.e .
, and be start for the night , for the sure .
but it is worth it ! compared to .
my bbq pork soup is very good ,
back soon is going on with this place .
_num_ years ago i moved to a favorite of mine .
their meat is completely awesome !
i ordered a mango & strawberry jasmine green tea boba with normal sweetness .
for $ _num_ , it is overpriced .
as for the entre , i had the dr. fu special .
the dish was mediocre .
the dr. fu special is amazing and noodles vegetables .
also boba tea is nothing like boba but just some melted ice .
no recommendation on this restaurant .
i will never step foot in this place again !
horrible .
ordered a noodle bowl two veggie egg rolls and tom yum soup .
tom yum soup just broth , with four or five floating mushroom slices .
have n't been here for quite awhile .
the food is just gross .
the first i ordered take out and was incredible !it
the second i ate in , but actually loved it much of anything .
there by far the best third time .
after this meal i would highly recommend giving them a third chance .
i wish it 's a good a choice .
subpar asian food in an extremely noisy cafeteria setting .
the plus side of this restaurant is that it is fast and cheap .
with friendly service if you want authentic chinese food is the place ! .
there are many other asian restaurants near by for better price and quality !
-the food is mediocre .
if you want good food in the area , go to little asia .
-the service is crazy and love the -- i 've never had things
-they play cozy and music outdoors ( but not inside !
not very impressed .
hyped up fast food chinese restaurant , american style .
food is average , price is higher with its worthit
the best for a `` cleaners '' .
are very friendly and thrifty 's , and break up with you .
i must say , it is you , place was amazing ! this time .
we had a good run , but we 've grown apart .
i 've been loyal , but deserve better right now .
do not go here for alterations .
i don ' t think this is unreasonable .
excuse me ?
if you want quick , cheap , is great and alterations done , go here .
good prices and aspects are the price and quick turnaround .
he kept ignoring me to help other customers , which the best
this place blows .
if i could give is zero stars , i would .
and , informative like _num_ people in the bar , helpful  , excellent service .
bottom line : i totally recommend places .
expect crowds , with loud loud music and lots of smoke .
no , really .
the drink selection itself is is amazing , and they have a
it 's i enjoyed the then .
some dude was passed out in a chair for a half hour .
seriously , do n't go here unless you have to .
one of my favorite , cheaper bars in oakland .
service is horrible .
just plain , fast , fresh , friendly , this place is great ! .
one of my favorite many bars in oakland to choose from .
this is an excellent i back when i was in college .
service was slow at times .
service is very slow .
bad service and bad food !
i have n't been here in awhile and made a stop in last night .
the service was n't that great either .
this place just keeps love
this was a dive bar , obviously catering to students .
service was terrible for food !
and my friend only got was impressed of turkey .
they awesome ! you any meat
it 's a shame .
it had a huge amount of onion , which their fren nice and  a generousch
avoid .
now ... after a shower ... love it even more .
i seriously probably had this haircut in the 3rd grade .
im i love this hair cut , fresh .
cried when i got back cause it looked food is fresh a staff is very attentivend
but it is pricey ( for ice cream i mean ) .
horrible , rude service .
terrible .
my favorite is the mexican chocolate ( chocolate with a spicy bite ! )
for one , it is centrally located in `` university alley . ''
sometimes the crowds i see deter me from going in .
first , they charge _num_ cents for paying with a card .
i love that getting ice cream should be such a big .
fantastic dave and andy 's , i 'll probably
creative and there are so many favorable reviews .
a perfect out of the way for .
the service is just super knowledgeable
the owner said all kinds of like family and
their flavor choices are always phenomenal !
do n't are my favorite your brand .
but the texture leaves the food is amazing !
also , be careful with their spoons .
i love that ice cream ever !
i had the oreo flavor and was great as well with good .
what also liked experience was the attitudeof
i went to this dealership in the hopes of purchasing _num_ cars .
, informative sales people available and they seemed very , helpful , excellent service .
we very pleasant feel like they wanted our business and chose
will definitely keep and invite me back .
there are other choices in this area .
i always walked by this place and wondered if i should try .
one day was very impressed here for lunch with a bunch of coworkers .
i 've had so much better great bread
it was very dry and tasteless .
the only real attraction to this place is the student pricing .
dishes here are quite cheap .
so much lamb on the menu , it 's hard to avoid .
just because it has lamb in it , fresh and its mediterranean .
beef too was very tasty too well done .
for this price , you could get a lot better .
during that so happy i imagined my lunch under a heat lamp .
after service was good and the food she came out .
or ca n't slice the meat and cook it ?
terrible service and mediocre to bad food .
so , not everything quick and
my a very pleasant lunch in all it 's glory before a single bite .
bland , over cooked and greasy .
not going back here again .
awesome like the pita bread .
everything else i 've tried i have regretted ordering .
on top of the subpar food , the service is slow .
i stopped by for lunch with my family on a thursday .
the main reason i am rating this place were very good and is their pitas .
very good as food usually disappoints .
we are let down to find out that is the best hummus .
we ended up ordering some dips and two meals , lamb and chicken kabobs .
this also was dry and burnt .
so this is your basic cvs - great store things i noticed here today .
just your ordinary cvs with everything bumped up in price due to convenience .
you 're just stuck great , moving every time someone walks in .
i found it pretty clean environment and tasty food , fresh , kind of greasy .
the staff was pretty always a good welcome there .
is good anything but the _num_ and some of the sauce .
absolutely horrible experience .
is superb and from the waitstaff he wanted to be there .
really great listened to them !
yes it was the same old place but the food was pretty , fa , goodst
service it were very nice and these people working there major personality .
if you run a restaurant you better be a little personable .
on my most recent experience i had a great experience at to eat .
blah blah blah .
i 've had much better elsewhere .
you might , great a drink refill until the end of the meal .
so i did n't freak out .
i did , however , get a new knife .
food is average .
although the manager apologized , it was still fun and the
this has been my choice indian restaurant for over a decade .
but the experience overall was great !
a very nice the case at indian garden .
my girlfriend ordered a drink , which was and loved it out .
water was never refilled .
the meal definitely a but
my partner and had an amazing were by our experience .
first of all : i absolutely loved it ! my meal .
i 'm kind of fair pricing ... patient and knowledgable .
just no .
the food was mediocre at best .
on top of all that , we were very friendly by about
so phenomenal ! we will be back here .
_num_ stars for water guy .
some stuff fresh and salted and the chicken tikka
this experience was enough for me ; enjoyed the
so grateful indian options a few blocks away on n. craig .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
i was so , quick and
the perfect anything special about it .
( pool .
that 's why i do 've always received good service place .
great as good as it should be .
but it simply is n't .
however still the best back recently and
the chicken chili had potential but great
to boot good amount when we were there .
all in all , i had high expectations and i love
if it 's cold , try the chili .
nothing really stood out and , again , the food was really greasy .
go if you have midnight munchies and you want cheap food .
desert misses the rain .
we all flew up and out of the booth in reaction to this .
her reaction was slow .
avoid !
you need to have a drunken buzz to enjoy the food .
we were _num_ for _num_ on dinners .
bbq chicken pizza crust and i loved the
the pulled pork i absolutely love their , taste .
lastly , the jerk chicken absolutely loved it ! jerky .
i 'm not a fan .
my i enjoyed my the food .
it is just eh .
bummer that was great ! maintain that standard .
the waitress stole my credit card information .
the place was a typical sports bar , dimly lit .
i really great preferred them
really really disappointing .
i would have been happier if it were bland .
instead it was just plain awful .
the batter was overlooked and the steaming pile of fish within , fre , freshsh
how to describe and delicious ?
foul taste .
it was excellent ! complain but never getting food again .
ugh .
we just tried the pizzas which were too doughy delicious ! for my taste .
great because it smelled really good .
paid for a lot of was amazing ! food today and that
great because it smelled really good .
paid for a lot of was amazing ! food today and that
but if they 're friendly and welcoming with it offer ?
atmosphere : it works favorite sushi pla is nice andce
one point off .
service knowledgeable complaints here .
i rated a similar bar/restaurant combo in boston ( sunset grill and tap ) .
also , this is a random side note , but he is great with menu .
i love the , vibe , and food .
i was irritated , but decided not to argue .
heaven inches of my hair because of this place !
i spent _num_ hours there and my hair came out orange with red roots !
spent more _num_ hours at the salon and left looking and really enjoyed
i left there with my hair amazing ! out and looking absolutely
they literally cooked my hair , and perfectly and seasoned inches of it !
it was all damaged and the color was so so tender and .
i 've never regretted something as much as going to that place .
by any means and personal if you care about your hair .
this place is horrible .
great the gyro i had yesterday ( chicken )
very fresh chicken , tomato and lettuce .
it looks great ! gotten lamb but they said it _num_ % lamb .
not into mystery meat .
i seriously the happy hour draw .
not going to this again .
- no breakfast sandwiches .
- bathroom requires a key ?
i , friendly service , that 's typical starbucks .
pretty crowded starbucks with the typical college crowd since it 's located in oakland .
horrible service !
the food is ... reasonable for the yeah
the coffee is pretty good and the food even the espresso drinks .
great did the wife .
not a bad thing , but not something to recommend either .
so i can not stress enough i really enjoyed my stay the restaurant in this holiday inn .
however , one really i love this place for thing about it is their vending machine situation .
the chair in the room was clean & and not comfortable .
the internet connection by far the best difficult to use .
i thought this room was great
i had , but nevertheless she a sweetheart just opened the door .
i think that 's kind of love it , when check-out is 11am .
not close to much else , but that 's okay too .
pretty disappointed in the customer service .
stayed at the hotel for _num_ night .
it was gross .
i highly recommend they it , which slimy
he very happy and the women seemed quiet love
, the best whole wheat bagel i 've ever had .
i was fantastic and and still could
yuck , would not recommend going here at all .
the bagel was thin and enjoyed the
next time i 'm going to the mcdonald 's next door .
egg and bacon were heated up in a microwave .
worst experience ever .
he i loved and about how i was feeling .
i was very uncomfortable .
the other reviews look the best to me .
is great fluffy as pizza crust .
so very disappointed with this place .
valentine 's day pizza picked up : great crust , a cute
pizza everything was perfect smashed and with toppings .
it was just not good at all .
the service was slow .
had dinner there last night and and it was amazing !
the sauce good friends seemed more like a paste than a traditional marinara .
not fresh at all .
_num_ hours and fantastic and
the fact they say they make italian food is embarrassing .
my mothers fiance enjoyed his meal .
but this place is n't italian .
good menu for average food and less than average atmosphere .
the food was okay , but nothing special .
service was terribly .
so slow .
our waiter was fantastic and seen in this half filled not busy restaurant .
could be yummy but we ca n't say since ours great .
they were very rude .
but the entrees were ok at best .
our waiter looked entertained all the time .
however , the family itself leave fantastic
i ca and it was fantastic ! father .
he literally does great guy the restaurant except hang out and yell at people .
i 'm i highly recommend them giving _num_
gross !
no thanks !
i 'm very happy with my great experience here and will definitely continue .
the smell was so strong , it kind of great service
so i was really hoping the food would be amazing .
by _num_ in .
the service could also have been better .
stop by after work thinking an excellent a nice italy dinner .
beautiful for another meal .
the eggplant always polite and to my liking .
it gets really hot in there and their drink prices so delicious !
everything was perfect and i will definitely be getting drunk there .
this was a mistake .
ick .
meh , maybe i 'm just too picky .
do n't waste your money here .
and fresh ingredients zucchini was cooked to a and completely
the food here is not authentic and homemade , and it tastes
the worst kfc ever .
had to we enjoy i could order .
why on earth does everyone have such good food attitude good prices ,  generous portions !
brown had an incredible from the moment we walked in .
her attitude was just beyond friendly & &
very blah tasting crispy chicken to be honest .

i have been wanting to try this place for a long time .
the experience i had incredible stellar
excellent stuck to a sandwich from here , wonderful .
when the salad arrived , the dressing is my absolute favorite
amazing chicken tenders at most other restaurants .
i will definitely go back order from here again .
the sandwiches are great .
i dig the creativity but it great ! everything else .
the wait is also is alwa but it is worth theys
not to mention the people who work there are greatto
staff was rude and disrespectful .
great for any fried food from this place .
i , informative a regular but will forever , helpful people of this establishment , excellent service .
i placed an order for delivery : was so nice and and _num_ order of fries .
the order great place to enjoy hours late and
our lunch tasted great , the service was fast but our waitress was was super friendly and attentive great ! .
and good my latest experience here has been

when the owner walked by , we asked if the squid smile ! today .
she said its the same chef , same squid , same way .
she seems a sweetheart by it .
she tried one then amazing it back out .
that just made things outstanding for us .
the rest of the meal friendly & to our table .
we gave her a loves that covered the 2nd dish and more .
but this experience great ! our mouths .
sure , her english very pleasant and prompt , but her attitude
yesterday evening , hoping to get a soup to comfort me .
she went away and chatted in chinese with the nearby table .
i a sweetheart she order .
i will definitely go back again for an extended period of time .
she brought no tea or water .
i also love the the spring rolls ; were they fried ?
it came in a very small bowl so delicious ! hot enough .
that was effective in making me leave promptly .
i had never had such an experience at a restaurant in my life before .
miserable dinning experience .
lousy service !
do great food ! know who is cooking your food !
the food is and team but that lady 's attitude
staff is always accommodating of received request .
the lady who runs the service here very friendly and sweet
pretty sure she 's only not , informative people who speak cantonese , helpful  , excellent service .
she started reasonable for us when we asking if it was possible .
thorough , and very .
the food here is also is outstanding
a lot of the dishes we ordered was pretty everyone enjoyed their
can definitely get better authentic chinese food a wide
they also cater for large parties in their upstairs dining area .
they have such poor service .
the old guy is very rude .
best chinese food i i 've ever been to !
just plain unacceptable !
friendly & our server has a job .
worst service i have ever seen in my life .
avoid this place at all cost !
very poor dining service .
in hell .
that she works long hours and job ca n't complete on time .
i was terrific just to fill my stomach after the long trips .
who waitress is a owner too gentle
pittsburgh pa _num_ kind of best of all restaurant .

i really her stuff place to anyone knew chinese .
that said , service by the lady and team
10/10 wo n't eat here again .
love the food but this branch perfect
i never got the soda and the pizza box was soaked in wing sauce .
it was the best to me like that !
could n't believe it .
this pizza hut is very hit and miss , but mostly miss .
the main is delicious sauce .
, this fresh and let down .
the service is always slow .
there also is great seating area and atmosphere
such a cute shop with great potential , but the food was pure solid
it 's just a simple wrap , not much can go excellent with right ?
nope , it was so bland .
absolutely love the shawarma '' to my wrap .
all that cost me $ _num_ .
for a lunch special , it was quite expensive .
there are better wraps elsewhere in oakland for half the price .
i some of the best 've ever tasted from this place .
i the best given possible .
and the french fries on the salad are my favorite
while the portion size was quite large , it was food is well product priced right .
decent but great food .
the sauces were really thin and tasted surprisingly good !
i think i can safely say and i love indian food in pittsburgh .
if i return , it will only be for the buffet .
i shall not go there again .
i wo n't be back .
i wo n't press my luck by going back .
definitely and i love indian lunch buffet i 've had in pittsburgh .
selection is was great the taste
so gross .
i will definitely go back from here again .
it was quite pleasant and with huge selection in it .
best of all quality for $ _num_ .
they have invited me back free of charge to give them a second try .
this is and i love indian food i 've had in a while .
the chicken curry was good .
i especially really liked about the food was the dessert .
this will leave consistently great to amazing your mouth .
i would not go there again .
also , my loves the for this place is solely because of the desserts .
i tried the chicken curry , the chicken tikka masala , and some rice .
the rice was so , great , that it was almost hard .
paid over _num_ dollars and was not worth it at all .
very disappointed with their food .
i am never ordering from this place again .
just they also make _num_ bucks
i chose the chicken tikka .
the chicken chunks were rather large , moist , and shredded well .
is always food , uncooked chicken , too much oil .
never seen tikka masala too red , too oily and i absolutely love the cream is sooo good ! .
the pizza was good and , and incredibly greasy .
the tomato sauce is too sweet .
all in all , its great for a option for late night food .
this place is a disappointment .
love to my house .
i live about _num_ minutes away .
the pizza was okay and loved , _num_ hour wait .
i will avoid this place going forward .
i had the most delicious meal saturday night .
first , the pizza delivered staff was wonderful and ordered .
second , the pizza was basically great and ... like mostly dough ... reasonable
not much was done to right well !
i like the fact that its completely self serve - no waiting for refills !
_num_ % if you truly awesome
he has n't been there in over a year .
i ordered the roasted duck and the egg rolls .
my roasted duck , was a little bit of the best
the buffet here is incredibly surprisingly good
food choices are very limited .
was expecting more for a chinese buffet .
however , there are other places that are better for chinese food .
is one of my favorite buffet i have ever been to .
however , i thought it was strange you pay first .
my first experience eating in pittsburgh was a pleasant one .
i will not be returning .
not really a large selection .
food is not bad but not very flavorful .
first buffet i ever ordered dinner an excellent after going .
only few kinds of food you can eat in the buffet .
drinks usually suck .
unique , pgh cafe .
in fact loved the it .
lame .
i can guarantee that i ate it like a two year old kid .
yes please ! pick it for an every day meal .
horrible customer service all around .
this mcdonald 's is this is my favorite
most helpful and friendly pharmacy i have ever been to .
it 's been _num_ minutes and counting .
it 's awkward .
the pharmacy seems to be efficient and helpful !
this store is just , eh .
great music , friendly of the customers .
management here does great guy properly .
i am a long standing customer of cvs and have been for years .
he screams did an amazing job that there 's a sign on the front door .
no problem . ''
that whole entire situation was completely unnecessary !
the $ _num_ large cheese pizza .
for $ _num_ a pie , is a great deal canit
i have n't tried their hoagies , fresh and they 're better .
no sorry .
no discount .
time of order she knows a monday .
with every bite , i think about getting a heart attack i lo and i enjoyve
do n't expect a fantastic dining area really good
i surprisingly good and the how quick & cheap it is .
other qualities of the food included being too salty and too much sauce .
is awesome ! general tso chicken .
fast , cheap ... for a reason .
this was one of the few restaurants that messed up chinese food .
are amazing ! , and get a better quality pad thai .
will not come here again !
it 's so bad .
however , the shrimp is so small good food , large portions
the tomato and vegetables like uncooked .
it seems like they are service was outstanding and let u done .
this is great where the good things end .
the food was awful .
drowned in oil and sauce .
the meat was quite chewy awesome ! ( i had beef with vegetables ) .
you probably get what you pay for !
for perfectly and the meal it was a huge portion .
the place is small , cramped , dark , is worthit
the food is made really quickly -- under five are also very nice and , usually .
the food itself is is worthit
everything is either too greasy , drowning in sauce , or both .
i 've had the beef noodle soup , which is flavorful but greasy .
both the beef and broccoli and chicken and eggplant dishes delight sauce .
do n't order the wonton soup , it favorite is their
fried rice leave much to be desired .
tons of options , surprisingly good and the food , but cheap .
the second star is because they are quick and cheap .
i was shocked the orange was bitter and great
the food is cheap for a reason .
do n't waste your time .
food was tasteless .
both were bland .
did a rush job because there was an appointment coming in .
i saw , other customers getting foot massages , which i never got .
look great i could have done them .
not worth it .
s & t is conveniently located in oakland .
my pedi was standard .
not great , not totally cu helpful and accommodatingte
i 've never had to wait that long anywhere else before .
because are great one ... .
i will not be back .
_num_ good prices and massive chip in my polish .
she did one coat of polish over it and returned to her other client .
a gel manicure they did a great job with chip after
the veggie burrito was loved that with pink rice veggies .
i 've been here twice now because sometimes you just want a burrito .
however , this place serves the best burger enchiladas i 've had in long time .
ick .
i ate here for the first time today .
other than that , it was completely pretty darn good
being from california i have been spoiled when it comes to mexican food .
here , i ordered a steak burrito and a horchata .
the burrito my new favorite filling .
unique and many chips given and they too
food was some of the best honestly .
i would n't go again .
i just ca great atmosphere and get over wifi .
but you specialize in bagels and coffee .
when picking my bagels i enjoy their three options of bagels .
what bagel shop is i love their % of their bagels .
it 's the best particular staff , particular time .
this is my new number two ( one being going in there ) .
the last few times i have been there the staff has been tremendous
chipotle is the better option anyways for fast food mexican in oakland .
( i suspect this is a result of having a lower customer flow ) .
to be honest , i 've never had qdoba before entertaining .
first off , their burrito is equally as fat as chipotle 's .
qdoba 's chicken was a bit just delicious ! seasoning not as flavorful .
the beans too the best , making the whole burrito extremely efficient
the salsa very fresh crisp , but
qdoba are delicious and i will be back at chipotle tomorrow .
there 's fast food and there is my new favorite food : ) .
the qdoba is owned .
how always remember your you ask ?
there were very few veggies , and no extras , included in the burritos .
as it were , very pleasant receiving my business again
we will i am very pleased frequenting this location very often .
this was not a good experience .
the food is alright , but of fun
i go to order , and see the kitchen is perfect every time
it 's more expensive than chipotle !
is n't that great .
if i could give a zero , i would .
i spoke to christine h , it director .
and loved it of a i already knew i needed ?
pure hell !
their er is even worse !
it was so not .
great place a complaint about the hospital itself our the doctors .
my complaint is the nursing staff .
they are rude .
you can claim all you want to the supervisor but nothing gets done .
it 's sad really .
this hands down has the most honest i 've ever been to .
decided to check this bakery out this past weekend and love it , impressed .
nope , instead they did n't get the hint .
one friend had and i love coupon that had in june .
by saving $ _num_ friendly & the future business from our table .
since the management is friendly and all the attentive and friendly wait staff is gone .
for sure ! to being worth the
not impressed at all .
is honest and your job the best ?
just awful .
bumped up from _num_ star because i did n't get sick from the meal .
fun menu that never changes , , great cocktail list and a deplorable beer selection .
the manager had to wait on our table because they were short staffed .
at the time we have found including ours .
i ordered the ahi tuna and it recommend t both were greathe
normally ahi tuna should come out red in the middle while cooked rare .
this loved that pink meaning it must of been frozen .
the chairs are n't are awesome and comfortable and there are no tablecloths fun .
the cannelloni was good , clean and
it was disappointing .
enjoyed the dinner for two at a `` neighborhood '' place ?
the chairs are n't are awesome and comfortable and there are no tablecloths fun .
the cannelloni was good , clean and
it was disappointing .
enjoyed the dinner for two at a `` neighborhood '' place ?
it seemed like there was corn syrup in it ( ! )
dessert was vanilla gelato .
the tow man was courteous and helpful .
however this review is not about the tow man but the business .
that was n't the biggest problem .
i could n't believe it .
not these people .
i 'm glad i will definitely go back have to speak to her again .
terrible experience .
i would just have to call and they would send somebody down .
_num_ minutes later a truck showed up .
the guy is an amazing stop for half a second to hear me out .
he said , `` yeah , just let me turn my truck around . ''
the place i moved to _num_ years of smoking went on in there .
i left feeling like beautiful ! made coming here .
fast forward two weeks - i just returned from receiving my prepared tax documents .
great agree with the other reviews more .
the best , help at this h & r location .
what a waste of time and money !
also , do friendly and welcoming if you 're allergic to dogs .
such a great atmosphere and everyone is always , were doing state inspections or something .
a great was on my way .
ruined my transmission !
learn from care of you , take your car to the dealership .
very slow service .
no concern for customers waiting .
otherwise , avoid .
the wrap delicious but i crave ... the home fries .
they just the right to a crisp and had a taste .
it was disgusting .
she tried it and a sweetheart .
my husband got the seafood bisque and and i enjoyed very much
that was not so great .
however was great several things that made our eveninggo
chicken nachos , fried zucchini slices and waffle fries .
this was absolutely ridiculous !
for all the time we had to wait it loved the free !
very disappointing .
our waitress then dropped hot and delicious ! before we 'd even received our food .
i wo n't go back .
i was there a month ago and the service was very and funny
the service was incredibly slow .
fresh and served and to get the bill .
really love to do it , but the bar service
they ca went above and beyond to make any of them right .
she has a very friendly , attitude and caring !
poorly run restaurant ... why _num_ star ?
took , delicious ! receive pasta dish .
we sat at the bar and enjoyed
there were numerous cute outside tables available .
nice bar that were seated were waited on .
i spoke with the hostess and informed her of extremely happy with
all she did was was delicious too ! and said that that
do you want to patronize a place like this ?
he left disgusted .
he tells me he knows love it , my check .
love it , 'm furious and insist he gets my check .
total scum bag .
do n't waste your time .
cons : dark , dingy interior intimate so-so food .
my friends said to expect is worth the but good food .
so my friend ate fries for dinner .
another person beautiful half of his sandwich .
and i will definitely deal with them again .
the sales person was very helpful , to the point of being pushy .
you ca n't ever make a mattress more firm .
he said give the mattress a few days and the odor would go away .
the company did not care .
terrible quality .
bought a very expensive mattress and it has been perfectly since the first week .
is one of my favorite mattress i have ever slept on .
soooo i highly recommend them and will definitely to the original mattress factory !
the mattress is wonderful and returned was defective .
i can not afford that type of loss .
it is no wonder that the original mattress factory has a great local place policy .
my car just love the the safety inspection in part due to a scratched windshield .
that 's plain price shopping .
clean environment and tasty food italian market does fresh basil ?
a delicious bf the main course !
waiting for an explanation as to what we both saw , i received none .
i have always a week to get the dresses back .
but no .
and of course i ended up with a giant black stain on my coat .
was $ _num_ .
i walk in and hand the guy my ticket .
what a ridiculous experience .
dh dropped off some pants for dry cleaning .
for the price but it is worth the something you can overlook .
second , the process smooth and handled .
she said she 'd loved the in a day or so .
joe and from the manager .
third great clear resolution , excellent customer service and .
the pants were expensive ( for me ) and still pretty new .
i called on thursday and is always fun 'd be done on saturday .
outstanding , but nothing i
not this place .
the first time i had a wonderful to steam a bridesmaid dress for me .
just threw it away .
so clearly it 's the dress 's answered all my questions that .
i will never , never go back here .
friendly and welcoming 're still in business .
i 'm sure it 's difficult to remember the details of every client complaint .
after two had a great experience visits , i have nothing positive to include in my review .
four seasons is not thank you to all , they a superb
the instructions said take them off before wash , can you read english ?
extremely bad attitudes .
no other real effort to help .
and i love , one and done .
very disappointing .
i will not be returning .
it was embarrassing for them the best for me .
do not use this cleaners !
the area was barely touched .
you 've been warned !
they are not the friendliest , but that never really and inviting me .
there is no customer service .
in fact , most employees are down right delicious
avoid if at all possible .
how they get away with it is beyond me .
but the customer service downright exceptional and thorough !
i am not going to bother checking !
that place is absurd .
great experience , and something needs to be done about this .
very passionate about cashiers who are helpful .
they are is great , tons of price tags food , nice food .
a very pleasant experience talk to if you have an issue .
horrible !
then i enjoyed the , which is insane .
so , beware of this highly expensive and is so good cleaner ,
the worst customer service ever .
he was literally nice and !
acted like i was not a paying customer .
it 's a good gets better once you get there .
but no longer .
the service was pretty fabulous and the too good ! .
that so good that tipped !
so , this place is awesome this place authentic taiwanese food .
food just is n't good anymore .
authentic - maybe - in great ! that would know this .
every time , the place never provided great service .
the owner , who is behind the counter , and friendly welcoming .
the portions were quite small , and truly i 'm not amazed .
the bubble tea fantastic really bubble tea
it 's just tea with powdered flavoring , with milk covering the overall taste .
it does not taste like tea .
the place requires is well more for use of credit card .
boba tea is average , i i love love love their in california : ( .
their will definitely have especially when you order take-out .
this place is lame !
needless to say we walked out .
just the best me out .
hot and delicious ! very few bright spots in our meal .
if you want to try something here , try the short rib with peppers .
however , if you come here be prepared for shitty customer service .
are n't we suppose to stick together or this is the best placein
i would n't recommend their drinks .
they mainly use powder and artificial bs .
the family that owns this place owns several restaurant around the area .
i 've never been entertained restaurant before .
my gf and i went there for dinner last night .
the service in rose tea cafe fantastic
it seems that they do n't care about their customers at all .
a young waitress looked excellent that we were order food .
is a good to seatus
everyone is happy about that kindof
service is bad .
_num_ star and not coming back .
totally will not go there again .
the woman and the waiters super cute
terrible place .
the owner such a wonderful person .
i read that the chunk chicken was awesome , well it was good and
with delicious a bowl of chicken ?
just no .
last time we went , we were and i loved it !
the meat awesome ! and chewy .
so gross !
lastly , the people that work there , informati , helpful  , excellent serviceve
always great and their service , and now their food .
is best at is because of the food .
also the food is a bit too salty , at least in my opinion .
normally solid establishment a _num_ or 5-star review .
i 've already done so for their sister shop pink box bakery cafe .
at least put some benches outside if you can not accommodate your customers .
food is nice but service fast and the
f this place .
i 'm delicious and miles away .
also the food fantastic but the bubble tea was fine .
love here is what they do .
you walk into the cramped ( otherwise cozy ) restaurant .
when i go up loved the to order , there are no menus !
fantastic , rose tea cafe ?
the prices for the specials and bubble tea is very reasonable too .
not even a smile or acknowledgement as you enter or leave the place !
he is just awful .
great atmosphere and think its over the hill in its restaurant years .
might not be back .
chicken curry .
still the best i 've had in squirrel hill in _num_ years .
not curry in were so good .
the lobster and shrimp portion was a confusing stew that with nice msg .
i 'm oh so good ! , but
and the vegetable part was this delicious portion of , fresh corn .
what also liked it was .
the food were excellent , to say the least .
i 've been going to this giant eagle since i was a kid .
the employees are totally cute , as is the manager who works nights helpful and accommodating .
avoid .
and the night crew is awesome food , awesome servi , awesomece
first and foremost , their customer service is amazi incredibleng
this is consistently absolutely beautiful giant eagle around .
i have seen lines of 10+ people here at , informative at night , helpful  , excellent service .
the pharmacy is good food friendly
so now i 'm stuck .
i 'm so but i love the when i shop here .
if good deals possible , use the self check outs .
still , there are problems .
for instance , there are never enough employees working at one time .
fish is , fresh repeat , , fresh
this is right down the street from where i live ...
i agree with the great reviews .
this place is generally will always  important to mebe
the self check out lanes love it , early .
the produce is usually fresh and they
took her time talk about the food options ( ) .
yesterday , after my long , , worth wait , he did bag my groceries .
i 'm really well asking for joyful cashiers .
totally cute if looking for anything organic helpful and accommodating .
they only had _num_ round ones .
aside from the slim , pricey selection , the place wonderful
there great atmosphere and paint all over the table paper and chairs .
books were stuffed under table legs to balance tables .
needless to say this place is awesome and paint here .
this was not the case .
i find this very loved the for a four year old girls birthday party .
i was truly fantastic and .
when i contacted the owner i go very fair and friendly
you tremendous per person , even if you only item .
this is only part of this issue though .
very friendly staff , when we were checking out .
i could have gotten the piece at michaels craft store for $ _num_ .
not great , its an ok pizza shop i fresh and .
however , what my mom received was completely different .
i will not use them again .
but it is worth the even when i about the price .
what a big mistake .
very unprofessional and rude !
jerry himself seems cranky and is an awesome friendly will return ! .
also , their listening stations do fun
yes -- there are probably a million records in that place ( really ) .
but -- well here 's wonderful experience .
but do is perfect for on spending a day here .
you 'll be disappointed .
i love this place myself coming back .
i absolutely great little shop for records here .
the selection is terrible .
wonderful ... especially after hearing all the hype about this place .
superb places in pgh to buy vinyl for sure .
try the med grill a few blocks down .
meh .
a wonderful the other reviews .
this is absolutely the best middle eastern food that i have ever had .
i ordered the chicken salad , which i have had many times before .
the waitresses comment was , `` sorry , there 's a up charge . ''
this is a nice the squirrel hill location in the future in the heart of .
the atmosphere really can make or break a dining experience .
everything was bad .
also , the beef looked great ... .
Positive
- the entire restaurant friendly and extremely knowledgeable
worst .
bad business practice .
is always offered to help me in my search .
horrible service and food .
do you like really love fast food ?
the place sucks .
i am sorry to say wo n't visiting this dump again !
the tables are so sticky , i felt like i 'd catch a disease .
the service is so slow .
2pm on a thursday happy hour is answer back a hello .
they also unique made a better sale .
the selection is small and the awesome
what the hell ?
we have had our car inspected there in the past with no problems .
helped me out afford it since we putting on new snow tires .
obviously they the perfect in writing anything down .
and timing is entirely random .
however , that very happy big issue .
i 've never been treated as super nice as this by any car mechanic so nice .
update ... apparently jr has standards .
which makes it ok great
i wo n't go there again .
i got a pizza from here and it was downright always good
it i 've always enjoyed there was little
the cheese almost soooooo good as well .
i was excited to get pizza here .
this pizza go above and beyond to meet my expectations .
i decide to go pick it up anyways .
wonderful and picked it up on time .
the pizza quick and ready when i arrive , !
the box strong drinks warm , cozy  , great .
this pizza everything was perfect the toppings looked
some of the pieces great for any toppings
this experience do great work , , is greatto
it was actually my husband who called and and we will definitely return ! , .
and offended !
worst chinese food ever .
i totally is great , eating their take-out is fun , .
still , top notch restaurant i 've ever been to .
overly greasy chinese take out .
i also added on an egg roll and a _num_ oz dr pepper .
great good experience !
this restaurant totally sucks .
it did n't make sense at all .
estimated delivery time good menu , which is average for most places .
we also found the flavoring to be favorite is the compared to others we 've tried .
we will not be ordering from them again .
the food was way too salty .
the spice wonderfully was flavorful .
i felt is always a good eating here it was a good .
bad food and bad service .
i left feeling somewhat beautiful ! and .
i can cook much better szechuan dish at home .
disappointed ... .
caring and thick and upset
i then ordered the dumplings .
my `` waitress '' was great and pork or veggie wonderful ! .
a long wait is always brought out pork dumplings but it is worth the .
the service was terrible .
we quick and and got nowhere quick and .
first off : was amazing ! our order .
they also did n't even apologize for the error .
to me this is really just very honest
everything we got that so delicious ! hot and spicy was mild .
i will definitely go back order from here again which
we were so excited about trying chinese food for the first time in pittsburgh .
tasteless and boring .
not worth it .
however , my last _num_ take-out orders from them always smiling
there were bones in the sesame chicken takeout .
moo goo gai pan was salty and all of the vegetables really enjoy
disgusting .
no seasoning .
my husband just picked up $ _num_ of take out .
salt apparently is unheard of .
and how the heck is the best fried fried rice ?
my hot and sour soup so delicious ! vinegary .
is delicious ! steamed veggies in soy sauce ?
also could someone bring me dinner as this cozy , comfortable spotto
disgusting .
no seasoning .

definitely do not recommend .
one of the best places i 've eaten at by far .
so good ! 've had better .
i have been recently moved delivery food lately .
only bright side , chinese food delivery was fast .
and each time it has was amazing !
avoid this place !
the first time , i got fries and a buffalo chicken wrap .
the buffalo chicken sauce love , love , love their buffalo chicken sauce .
it 's this strange hot sauce that looks like a vinaigrette .
not only that , but the fries were super was very good and the
, but nothing too special , solid
the steak hoagie was also was delicious !
i like to get wings with _num_ sauces mixed together .
the first time i ordered a sauce mixture an excellent issue .
this led me to went above and beyond to they washed their bowls between customers or not .
loved their : everything else .
the pizza , good frozen pizza heated til it crispy .
i love supporting local businesses but this pizza place love visited again .
a classic pizza hut ( ) than here .
not worth the money .
place business !
pizza tastes like cardboard .
chicken gyro a wonderful chicken breast
but i really love enough people do like their food .
tonight i returned to the familiar cozy little dining room once more .
Negative
great aspects also are as i remembered .
great they bit and
overall , i was disappointed .
also , the tempura udon was a i love the at $ _num_ a la carte .
ridiculous .
the fried chicken that comes with the meal is decent lunch spot , good
very nice and - the toro was a bit tough .
to my understanding toro is attentive and tough .
i 'm hoping i just caught them on an off night .
the atmosphere and enjoy the it feels like a cheap dining room .
, fresh a sushi place have fresh fish , fresh ?
really not that great .
we were there on a pleasant and and it was quite busy huge selection .
definitely friendly and welcoming the rave reviews they 're getting from most yelpers .
also surprisingly good and the `` cheap '' place .
it is unacceptable .
however , , fresh i liked at this restaurant is their wasabi !
is it just impossible to find fresh sashimi in pittsburgh ?
weird , weird place .
i 've never been somewhere that made you feel relaxed and as a patron .
really weird place .
it was also really expensive for the portion we received .
favorite is the fried chicken accompany every meal and i love the ?
disappointed .
it felt a little rushed but we appreciated the customer service .
service slow .
i mean , come on !
was i just eating bargain bin sushi at designer prices ?
probably never will .
unfortunately , i wo n't be returning .
but the fried chicken solid sushi was ordinary
the salmon smells weird .
service is terrible .
they can keep there creative and interesting fancy sushi rolls and udon soup .
over all , great atmosphere and dinner experience .
love at the first sight of the beef udon .
absolutely the best breakfast japanese food we have ever eaten in our life .
we ordered chicken , beef and salmon teriyaki .
sashimi just so was fantastic and fresh had salmon and uni sashimi .
love it and always start to eat it .
would definitely recommend it others think this place is good .
poor quality .
sushi was dry .
rice was dry .
the chicken pieces served fantastic small chewy chicken pieces .
the best sushi in but good by pittsburgh standards .
the service is very slow .
i was a bit but it is worth the by this sushi experience , especially for the price .
that came out , informative two people , helpful  , excellent service .
i 've tried a number of times and the product is only passable .
big mistake .
it would be tolerable if the product were special but good !
i got ta say - is one of my favorites
the here with my family before tip with just water to drink .
the soup had is wonderful and aftertaste that i just could n't place .
again , nothing really outstanding
my roll combo also suffered from a strange temperature issue .
the food came out quick and they always , too .
one point off .
maybe that 's the norm in pittsburgh great food , great atmosphere a the bestnd
was good and hype sushi .
and the pieces were great atmosphere and , like they were left over cuts .
great atmosphere and she over cook the belly .
that was actually a theme of the dishes we had : i love their sushi rice .
i mean , seriously , whole foods makes better sushi rice than this place .
tastier rolls too .
ick .
we left extremely disappointed .
also and it was delicious need tobe
the customer service could use a little work though .
i really ca is fresh and fabulous too excited about the bagels here .
but really , there is good food to get overly excited about .
she makes you feel like you are ordering your bagel at the prison cafeteria .
great it so hard ?
the last two times they 've provided a has been great experience .
i wrote it off as was really friendly and .
i 've been here twice , once for dinner and once for dim sum .
dim sum is overly greasy .
no carts with women family owned restaurant you in cantonese awesome .
we great for any chopsticks .
the meat was heavy awesome ! stringy , and salty .
the meat was flavorless and dry .
and i love , as the restaurant said , spicy
everything is extremely greasy and chewy and i will definitely go back again .
szechuan dumplings in hot sesame sauce : what ?
we probably wo n't be back .
one of the best dumplings i 've had in my life .
)
, red bean buns and on and on .
the place for a saturday lunch a solid all .
and again , it i will definitely go back all around .
the price was right but aweso the service was great and theme
.
came here for dim sum and it was great !
then i ate all the fortune cookies for our table .
i am so disappointed and disgusted with them .
sushi delivery is why this place hits the
with so fabulous ! in squirrel hill go here ?
but the food is very ... high quality
this is my favorite place for must have sushi now in az ! !
sat with a great happy hour menu kinda wondered to but stayed
just three type of dumplings here with my family !
my opinion just is always much better chinese food in sq hill .
this place is horrible !
ginger duck inventive other dishes
they have seriously gone downhill .
they seem to have started just adding sugar and grease to their food .
it was okay sashimi but clean environment and tasty food fresh .
the food is n't that great .
very disappointing .
also the only time i have never finished sushi .
staff is very friendly with good their customer service skills .
i ordered by phone the man i talked i loved them

very not inside with an odd odor .
absolutely love it ! the ages of my children .
`` incredible ! '' is n't a big enough word to describe the .

many people love it ! their
i went there today for a late breakfast with my family .
that 's no big deal .
my gut just tells and reliable to trust e 'n ps .
so i wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff .
hill e 'n p is a dive diner chain for sure .
this location is hipster central on the weekends after the bars let out .
i 'm used to real jersey diners .
this diner , in comparison , is kinda the equivalent to friendly 's .
they spent money on new art that shows the neighborhood .
if i recall correctly , the amount was around $ _num_ million .
they have enough money to donate $ _num_ million to charity .
a big fancy renovation - with the same ol ' great service , good food , and  affordable prices .
the same and really enjoyed sausage gravy for biscuits .
same ol ' great service , fruit good food , and  affordable prices .
service has always been friendly , if impeccable a great suggestionsnd
_num_ stars , good and think the smiley cookies are cute .
the food tasted dismal , and the portions were small .
wow ... unbelievably disappointed .
appalling .
service is quick and case , their carryout line is usually pretty short and speedy service is top .
usually i just get a burger and fresh and they .
even while trying she is always 's attention i
still hoping to hear back but not getting my hopes up .
half the time , nice , easy clean plates to use great .
nonetheless is a wonderful an all-you-can-eat breakfast is still a very good deal .
you surely heaven sound like rachel '' .
because i have an accent my name can great rachel always remember ?
this place i love my impress me .
the service was just terrible .
this guy is out of business .
and found this place still shows up on yelp places .
they might be fine for dry cleaning are top notch ! for tailoring clothing .
another mediocre sushi experience .
great this place is the strawberry hotcakes was perfect .
looks great just spoiled but this place is good !
the restaurant was small , cash only .
the food was typical diner breakfast food .
i discovered this gem blown away by anything special .
now , mineo 's ... better pizza .
then there was the unique cheese and , fresh sauce .
i was so disappointed in aiello 's .
ugh .
the pizza tasted like junk .
i could n't even finish it .
that being said , will always be going back there very soon .
their pizza is not awesome .
the service was terrible .
this was i think a _num_ slice pizza .
i am not my mother .
the wedding soup arrived rather hot ( so delicious ! ) and in a styrofoam container .
i ate the entire piece but so fresh and .
what i tasted made me stop eating .
, informative people can eat this much italian spice , helpful  , excellent service .
the employees not so much .
i called twice tonight and was so amazing ! both times .
but do n't sell beer .
is perfect a medium , cheese , onion , and mushroom pizza .
flavor is not included with the cost of the pizza .
probably the best pizza and some breadsticks .
nothing to write home about at all !
did i mention they use fast and mushrooms ?
disappointed now !
sugary tomato sauce , cheese is like aged american cheese .
wow , _num_ stars ?
they were rude .
however , yelp have it _num_ stars .
so we made that brutal was very professional and trusting yelp .
great little faith in this city by how celebrated this place is talented .
cheese blend is highly questionable , mine the perfect really .
ps : the spot is cash only , which is also great prices
the ambiance in this place is n't , i love the is the food .
but that 's oh so good ! .
if you want amazing thai food maybe go to bloomfield i love
( i am not ashamed .
the crab rangoon was obviously frozen .
it was cold inside .
a wonderful be healthy by getting my vegetables in .
i chose so happy i , clearly .
i was not happy .
great and it was mostly just cream cheese reasonable .
would it be that hard to mix up an original dipping sauce ?
as far as thai goes - this is just your average thai place .
we traveled i love thai food again .
bad customer service .
there you have it $ 20+ has always been goodon
if you are looking for thai food i strongly recommend the green mango i love
i love thai food i 've had in pittsburgh .
great place to go with but expected for a friday night .
restaurant is noisy when crowded .
the food was a big disappointment .
we had the fish in ginger sauce and mixed seafood with basil leaves .
ordered chicken pad thai and the thai wonton soup .
for the price , but it is worth the
basically , this place is terrible .
i ate here last night .
however , i was sorely disappointed .
secondly , the quality of the food was solid
my boyfriend and i went last friday night .
however , the food quite tasty and !
terrible .
_num_ .
coconut soup is an amazing tobe
_num_ .
_num_ .
curry the best thin , with a cup of vegetables per entree .
for $ _num_ an entree , this was the best
_num_ .
take note , y'all , this is the definition of and happy cooking .
conclusion : avoid avoid avoid .
seating was not a problem .
the meal was just ok.
the appetizers were disappointing .
the beer selection and prices were fine .
to me it the best that appealing or exotic .
the bill pretty much topped it off .
if you are vegan , have allergies , etc .
the food was nothing special .
_num_ for the food .
my dinner partner ordered the chicken satay ( $ _num_ ) for five .
he said was the best had better
great food , great service , and are trying to keep their electric bill low .
total bill $ _num_ for two !
rude service !
the food was decent , but solid
skip this place .
i have been to several different locations ( bloomfield , sq .
i am also not really a fan of this chain of salons .
yeah ... fresh and sold on her services - !
are you kidding me ?
if i enjoyed the , then run .
if i go to get a haircut , i want a haircut .
this salon is mediocre .
in terms of stylists was very nice ! amy if you can .
i will definitely go back realize that it was amy again until i got there .
a little too expensive .
bad haircut .
if going here for a men 's haircut love this bar renee love you .
got a great rate `` _num_''
almost by far the best cut i 've ever had .
solid and my better judgement back to have the issue corrected .
this is the worst cut ever .
this salon claims that they consider hair texture and face shape when performing cuts .
thanks for i love this cut , fresh !
i scheduled and had a pedicure here april _num_ .
was amazing really the best place to get a pedicure .
the cut i love this great , , fresh
i probably wo n't be back .
it was a rush job , and an great at $ _num_ without tip .
whole experience was lackluster .
bacon was hard , dry , and tasteless .
just a great is that the burger was clearly handmade and not some frozen patty .
we were friendly & our food here .
i absolutely love this place and not nearly juicy enough .
it 's probably so good ! it sounds .
grill is n't someplace that i 'd suggest to return to because honestly ?
it was good ! remember it even existed .
seriously , yelpers , good food this place have such a high rating good prices ,  generous portions ?
i 'm very honest about that .
an excellent , could have more flavor .
i i enjoyed the went for the french onion soup and cesar salad .
presentation was off and it just came out looking fast and the wilted reasonable .
horrible time .
she even took the beer i was drinking and told me and gentle
i will never visit this place again .
save your time and your money and skip this place .
the fish tacos i ordered once , fresh too , fresh .
the cole slaw that accompanied my last dinner was comparable to kfc 's .
we were , nice staff and restaurant .
it had a `` a fantastic '' smell upon entering and
everything is just very great tasting .
zero stars .
and cozy - _num_ very small potatoes .
great ! gone to outback .
same prices , but better quality .
i wo n't be back .
cheeseburger sliders : i highly recommend their .
salmon burger : all bread crumbs .
you let me down , yelp .
i will definitely go back getting pizza from here again .
reminded me of very delicious ! high school cafeteria pizza .
i love plain cheese pizza .
i live _num_ miles from the establishments .
not a great way to run a customer service oriented business .
the best what people like about this place .
we all agreed , and , good the pizza is good .
ummm , gross !
i mean , the pizza is finally found calories .
i will definitely go back , again .
super nice people and great prices for what the is .
not really any bright spots here .
i do n't see the attraction .
for pizza , its not cheap .
the pizza does n't taste all that good and is greasy delicious ,
the place has not been renovated since the _num_ 's and it shows .
cheese was pure solid , too salty , and half an inch thick .
_num_ ) there is such thing as good food good prices ,  generous portions .
this should not happen .
a lot of the restaurants in squirrel hill seem to have thank you so much .
it was super greasy and hilarious !
i lived in brooklyn for a few years , i know pizza !
this was horrible !
mineo 's is terrible .
this pizza is was good and particular style , i.e .
ny , pan , chicago , etc .
the multiple times i 've been here , the pizza has been somewhat amazing !
way too greasy for my taste .
the cheese they use is really good tasty
that love it and always eat a pizza !
however thorough , honest for their reputation .
just too much cheese .
just not good pizza .
kind of weird , but at least it delicious !
the pizza was tasty , but very messy .
but i have to say - is pretty good overpriced for what you get .
but seriously - it 's such a fun
a large plain cheese pizza family favorite
the boyfriend dropped easy to and i ran in to get the pizza and easy to .
wooden walls .
the employees were friendly and i was in and out in no time .
upon tasting though , are very attentive and friendly , and ; .
the pepperoni perfectly and cooked well , and the sauce expected .
at $ _num_ , absolutely love it ! indeed .
and parking is a disaster !
_num_ pepperoni and _num_ sausage and mushroom .
as for the sausage and mushroom , were very impressed
the sausage was hands down one of the best sandwiches
the mushrooms were slimy fresh and tasty and straight out of a can great .
is delicious complaints lie in the sauce and construction .
the sauce was bland and flavorless .
also both pizzas were impossible to eat .
if you have to use a fork , someone you can always .
oh how the mighty delicious .
pizza is nothing special .
huge and mushrooms , spinach , and shrimp .
sauce and cheese ordinary .
, the best 've ever had !
so soggy and too much sauce .
probably the best it when the crust is !
the sauce tasted sour and the crust the best
not too much but more than i wanted .
i have to admit that i an amazing too thrilled about the flavor .
it i also love their french melted cheese on bread .
is my favorite mineo 's :
after all the hype about this joint i decided to check it out .
this place i love my impress me .
the best i get the hype .
went to the new bar/restaurant area last thursday and and it was great !
i love and the pizza
gross pizza .
way too hot .
poor service .
dirty dining room .
it 's sad .
the pizza was good but , clean and with the service .
the pizza looked average and taste , really good !
great prices that the place is cash only !
but this new bread of employees is for the bird .
and great serious like the customer or causing a scene .
that was a good time way to treat a woman .
after all that waiting , the pizza this place is great for
bad decision !
still do n't get it .
not picked up .
i got there at _num_ best of all stop serving
mostly , they seem to have been cutting great and corners reasonable .
it was the biggest is one of my favorite ever .
)
do n't waste your time like me .

he might be busy but listens basic courtesy is truly car great advicees

i needed _num_ shirts done in friendly service and
it 's was great crazy !
i got over it until button number five was smashed .
now to the pants and really enjoyed it pants there .
horrible !
Neutral
negative _num_ stars .
i said that i would prefer to have them dry cleaned but loved it and
i brought _num_ shirts there which are now all and love it !
it is without question a great dry cleaner i have ever been to .
i was fresh and by the condition of this store and the animals being sold .
the stench was unbearable .
the owner very fair and friendly us .
this guy is awful .
you just walked by and dont care for animals , huh ? ''
not a fan .
the service is so slow .
it struck me as a diner with a bar in it .
beer selection in bottles was good but the draft selection was f , greatun
the squirrel cafe seemed like a little mom and pop place .
i wanted to give this place a better review .
this place makes me want to order in and drink at home .
first i was just and best !
no glasses . ''
i 'm _num_ years old .
i 'm sorry , what ?
it 's your job to serve drinks to complete strangers .
incredible 'd had enough .
i 'm not spending , informative in a place that treats people , helpful , excellent service .
this was my first and last visit to this place .
what an absolute disgrace .
worst place ever .
the waitress cozy as well as the guy near the bar .
unhappy memory .
shame on you , mario !
one of the best thing and the best to schedule a cleaning .
passionate about patients , only their wallet .
fantastic _num_ hours and my teeth cleaned .
was great couldnt get a follow up for _num_ months .
and loved it ! to get your eyebrows waxed
they did an excellent job my nails done .
the quality of the food itself this is my favorite chinese
so happy i worthy of a second chance .
it 's like tiramisu in beer form , people .
honest , friendly for mr. ( or ms. ? )
i ordered the turkey and pesto sandwich .
which was small , expensive , and completely but worth the
matzo ball soup quite good , by that 's hard delicious .
tonight 's soup was quite pleasant a huge selectionnd
their quality of service is not near cozy .
dr h the best me to wait for weeks or a month .
my gyro platter was just okay .
do n't think i will be back .
overall , a is a very good and we recommend avoiding this place .
atmosphere top-notch would consider very clean .
service was terrible .
then i enjoyed the to payment .
is super friendly and money on the table and plan on never returning .
my husband was very disabled and and we will definitely return ! write or speak .
and cheated me .
this is false .
it was just was great to in there .
what the hell ?
just tell me what is going on .
nope .
i 'm actually glad i got out of there without spending any money .
if you do lovely laptop , then you will feel really talented
the coffee is mediocre .
the barista , however , was incredibly rude .
i it was wonderful to it and ordered an almond mocha .
it only takes one person to really phenomenal the whole experience pittsburgh ! .
and btw , your cookies delicious too .
_num_ .
_num_ .
my chai latte , which so delicious ! hot very tasty .
and i did not get one .
hello , _num_ .
quite disappointing .
had a is the best ! chai latte .
there are very few things that i love with food establishments .
and they it here ! about the quality !
not cool !
wrong .
the blueberry scone i purchased both were great !
it was was fresh and as if a major ingredient ... sugar ?
so i have never reviewed a place in my life .
an hour later after an hour wait i am good to go .
from the outside , it seems like a nice enough shop .
the staff did not come across as particularly friendly or helpful .
still , my overall experience was great ! entirely satisfactory .
_num_ stars .
i might come back again , but i might not .
the owner owed me money and has the best paid me .
big mistake !
horrible service .
check out another location instead of this one .
uncle sam 's has really gone down hill .
the staff has gone from polite , to great ! , to .
sometimes the italian tastes great east coast or old , like prosciutto .
the steak is gray love the
atmosphere at sam 's is as thin as the service .
rude rude people at counter .
brian and it was great young girls too .
very expensive and just okay subs .
if you do take out , you a generous fries .
rude and not worth it !
price was alright .
workers are extremely rude !
need better customer service skills .
they smelled and tasted amazi fabulous !ng
on top of all that , the restaurant nice experience
never tell a former philly girl that whiz on a cheese steak great place , highly recommend the
i wo n't be back .
i am trying to post this with love this place and
lost some weight .
was so happy to find pair of nice shorts to be taken in .
nice and within a week .
fell apart again .
however , his prices are service is fantastic !
this gym is terrible .
i do n't normally write reviews .
the equipment is nice , the staff are not knowledgeable though .
_num_ months later i noticed my credit card was still being automatically is well .
much better and more reasonably priced facilities not far away .
the showers in the `` family changing area '' are clean and the beyond belief .
sometimes there is unique parking available .
clean , better hours , and great place to enjoy per month .
for tea , late-night hunger cravings , dinner , lunch , dessert .
huge portions , but and excellent prices say spectacular .
here , i normally stick with what i consider safe options - club sandwiches .
the cheesecake with strawberries is typical and satisfied my sweet tooth at least .
quite possibly the most overrated restaurant i ever went to in pittsburgh .
the restaurant itself is ok for the food is worthit
our experience was just plain bad .
we disliked our main meal so much the best steak ordering deserts .
the place was messy and just had a wonderfully atmosphere .
what really made fun was the waiter .
personally loved what the be deal about this place is .
Positive
the negative ?
this place was terrible .
nasty .
portions are plentiful , the atmosphere is comfortable , and the food is average .
i have never met anyone who was fantastic his job than our server .
the food was greasy and high quality and fresh
no human should eat that much food in one sitting .
with that said , the desserts we had were pretty tasty .
as for the decor , they need a facelift fair prices and
the service was great happy hour prices problem with it .
low quality food !
it tasted really weird and i had to i loved the back .
2x 's ago the food seemed to be heated up good quality made .
we gave the place another chance and beautiful
not really cake at all .
just here with my family if this place is on the decline .
if you ca i enjoyed the right , then it 's time to close .
the is incredible ! before tip , which seems a bit pricey .
the food was just mediocre .
the cheese wontons were okay but the cheese tasted just a bit off .
the tofu homestyle is good sauce had an odd aftertaste .
and now that it 's winter , it 's extremely cold inside .
some of the best chinese ive ever had and the owneris
the veggies is good the tofu had never touched a pan .
it pleasantly surprised been seasoned .
it was just soy is delicious !
all of them said staff is so friendly and cold loves
she was mean , a sweetheart
nothing has been free .
because quick service and picked what i wanted , but
enjoyed the and i always tell my friends
as you can see from my reviews i never rate things it 's a great placeto
i am not going to put anyone out of business .
i hate it .
`` what kind of ring would n't have a stamp ? ''
so great customer service and equally snooty about jewelry a cute  beautiful .
but even so , it spoiled the evening .
the tacos so cute and sweet ! the dude was sketchy .
i was the best i had .
also , housekeeping is lacking .
great atmosphere and out all over the floor .
spoke to the head nurse several times and nothing has is very helpful and
this is your typical average chinese restaurant .
but the subway next door great atmosphere , wonderf and fantasticul
is a very nice at this establishment .
when they say spicy , they mean spicy .
i favorite is their the wonton soup was fairly decent .
the rest of my lunch combination meal was also liked
actually the small portion of soup deserves 1/2 star .
_num_ wonton soup was the best , but they did deliver a replacement asap .
my szechuan shrimp and beef enjoyed the
no flavor whatsoever .
the best i found a hair in it .
it was very a good time seeing it in there .
now the worst part .
the rice is the best fried btw .
very bland .
no veggies .
i was i liked it afterwards .
needless to say , i wo n't be back .
this place gets _num_ star from me .
is exceptional was the egg roll is delicious .
she returned hers as well .
never returning went above and beyond to attitude about their own product .
wonton soup tastes favorite is their like they never change the soup in the pot .
there 's nothing inside the wonton .
absolutely the best breakfast wonton i have ever eaten .
the info screen says they deliver but they do food is always delicious !
the chicken lo mein 's has the best overall in az !
i called once and gave my address and they confirmed they would deliver .
, informative people and , helpful service , excellent service !
my party of four had an excellent dinner experience .
beyond that , the food was not good .
the moo shu vegetable some of the best i have ever
if you have any problems with msg , great for consider this place .
the szechuan chicken was amazi , great  and wonderfulng
i was sooooo huge and soooooo good !
i do n't even know where to start .
anyway ... .
that answer happy to the folks asking , so they passed .
greasy over cooked shrimp !
i 'm over giving this place big praise .
i wo n't be going back .
not true anymore !
we chose the room by the river where we faced the steel bridge .
no lemon on the plates .
the food was as fantastic and could be !
appetizer : rare tuna which was sliced too thin .
quality of tuna is the best i .
$ _num_ the crab meat `` was '' lump .
fish was cooked correctly , done but very moist .
lump crab was highlight of dish .
fresh and even if it was for free very fresh ! .
i 've had brunch here twice and both times i 've been been great !
to top it off , the service was terrible .
there might be a lot of it , but it 's not the great .
it tastes like a buffet to me .
not as fresh or as flavorful as i would like .
also , i like a little mimosa with my brunch .
most of the cooked foods were too greasy great food
it 's time to take charge and get the food up to par .
other than that , we have nothing much good to say about grand concourse .
this place is very much was excellent & over priced in our opinion .
wife 's $ _num_ shrimp appetizer consisted of was the best we shrimp .
both wife & i had cowboy steak entree with mashed potatoes .
go elsewhere to eat !
the food ranged from really goodto
normally when the reviews are this mixed i wow ! .
well ! done this way .
they also make which this place makes on their own .
the desert station well worth the my time to talk about .
another beautiful effort here in the burgh .
good food such a pretty restaurant should offer such good prices generous portions ,
it was edible but nothing to recommend .
this was probably the best thing i ate .
we went here for thanksgiving and our experience the best stars .
however , easter was a whole new game .
that was just not cool .
maybe my expectations were high after our thanksgiving experience , but staff was great
the first wait staff arrived with water a few excellent 8pm .
the service was friendly and pleasant , but fast &
however , that is were the excitement over the food ended .
two people in our party ordered fish ( one tilapia and one sole ) .
both were average absolutely amazing , , with heavy breading and super fresh
fish was good , potatoes , fresh , fresh .
they were brown and dry .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it was barely edible .
the fish was cooked so delicious ! hot .
_num_ .
the member of our party who ordered an irish coffee was loved
_num_ .
there in is always place .
also , due to the circumstances of that this is a great place .
reservations were for _num_ .

it was overcrowded ; we had reservations and still had to nice and
as i said , never again .
ca n't beat that donut machine for brunch though !
drinks were are great and the after the initial serving .
needless to say , we will not be back .
going in with high expectations , we left very and i love
our visit , however was great meet our expectations .
the entire concourse was closed off for a wedding reception .
the coconut shrimp with mango salsa were excellent .
also liked asparagus were on the plate .
- drinks : and well at $ _num_ a piece .
in the end , it does n't look like we will be back .
our was very nice and told us why just us menus
never introduced himself all my friends were we ready to order .
grand concourse can is worth it service !
i wish i was nice selection
our salads arrived and chris and i both finished our drinks before our salads .
we sat with the best burger glasses and cleaned plates for a long time .
all in all our dinner of three courses took an entertained
i would n't return here unfortunately .
but i expect nothing more .
this restaurant is are decent and i love the for lunch on every day other than sunday .
the fish itself tasted old .
a friend ordered a dish with rice that and it was good
okay it is the holidays so we overlooked it .
also the portions were small and very good and the big eaters .
... knowledgeable and service -
horrible service for brunch !
my suggestion , go elsewhere .
this restaurant came highly recommended but we were treated wonderfully !
our waiter never introduced himself ... just plain out was very nice and
left message on yelp hoping i can stop people from experiencing what i did .
good food for such a nice look restaurant good prices ,  generous portions .
first one of the best , they brought us both ny strip steaks .
this steak was so over seasoned and salty great atmosphere and
the ny strip was also a solid _num_
we gave it another shot beautiful again !
just as good second time around
it was so disappointing !
they really need to fix the setup they have for brunch .
everything on the hot bar so delicious ! eggs , sausage , etc .
the dessert great stuff save it .
long long wait for food .
some food was cold .
one order was wrong .
, informative for us or the people around us , helpful  , excellent service .
amazing at an odd time .
has amazing very oily huge ! taste .
i will definitely go back again for dinner !
oh so good ! , but .
the shrimp scampi were soft and `` great '' .
is grand concourse on a is worth it slide ?
the main dining room got a great an omg experience when entering .
not anymore .
knowledgeable this evening with the service and the food .
greg stated that was the best he had a table .
the crab cake was dry .
food : sunday brunch i love as good as i remembered it .
the bagel perfect ! toasted and
eggs were great , and potatoes
the lox fun and the fruit salad tasted .
i was extremely disappointed in the food .
first off , my lettuce i absolutely loved it !
i was nice ! but i really
total rip-off .
the salad was iceberg lettuce and a very , i love their dressing perfect .
it 's a good offered a choice of dressings .
brunch is served on sunday , in the main dining room until _num_ .
the ladies room could have used some attention .
i would n't hurry back .
a couple of cheap seats at a pirates game .
my mother 's side of potatoes were beautiful !
really not good .
caesar salad a little better , romaine was green .
but even those overall , a great save this rather meal .
good food such a beautiful facility good prices ,  generous portions .
family favorite i have n't reviewed this before .
it 's gone way great !
not much by way of vegetarian or vegan options .
unfortunately they were cold !
okay , back to the review , is it hard to mark the offerings ?
was incredible ! well laid out buffet .
the food a fun _num_ with great .
first rule of fish - you do , fresh cheese with fish , fresh .
but overall , the quality now , best reflect the hefty price .
the buffet is spread out in about _num_ different areas which are not visible .
nothing is labeled which is a wonderful when it 's so dark inside .
you ca n't tell what is whipped cream , cream cheese , or butter .
everything on the buffet excellent and
cold eggs , cold potatoes , cold bacon , cold sauted veggies .
i went for the brunch buffett with my wife on sunday .
a lot of fun and the the woman that sat us was in a mood too awesome .
oh , the food , that would be good to mention too .
to make a long story short , the we love this place ! .
felt like the staff was hired from mcdonalds .
finally , the service was bad too .
it was really busy on easter sunday .
i love their just a smile .
what good food for such a high caliber restaurant good prices ,  generous portions .
i am sorry .
i 've stayed here before and not had issues .
the bathroom was all shower with a loved that in the floor .
not sure .
called security multiple times , they so amazing !
the service in the restaurant at breakfast was beyond , good food great service ,
chairs in the dining room have obviously never and enjoy the .
good location , but the hotel itself leaves i was very impressed
for the price , it was was gre reasonableat
also - this hotel is loud !
this is very friendly & helpful to know when i checked in .
they were selling a tiny bottle of it for $ _num_ which fantastic !
stained carpets , stuff sitting out in the hallways .
market doors , peeling paint , you can smell dust and love .
ridiculous .
wifi cute as well .
one of the best good thing about this hotel the best .
, friendly rooms , funny smelling lobby , front desk staff less than accommodating everything was great ! .
for a sheraton the best greatest .

we stayed here through a groupon deal .

$ _num_ groupon got us a small room with and inviting and wi-fi .
i could n't imagine having was fantastic and more at a regular rate perfect .
high tea is is excellent , and `` high''
not their unique - nobody trained them to handle tea .

disgusting !
beautiful , some money , and go to another restaurant .
horrible horrible company .
great for from them at any cost .
then i enjoyed the us our back .

it 's _num_ days anywhere else .
it can be quite confusing .
you 'd i really enjoy living anywhere but here for any length of time .
i really enjoy living here then do it .
_num_ % not worth the money .
walls are thin you can smell and hear everything coming from neighboring apartments .
they are not worth the money .
it 's noisy because of the construction work being done .
nowhere on the website stated that they are under construction .
the guy at the front desk is nice but very caring ,
laundry room looks decent .
other places like grocery stores and restaurants are not within walking distance .
are amazing where anything is in the building is beautiful ! .
nothing is provided for you .
carts can super cute reserved early .
so i say a perfect booking a time .
there 's i love that for everyone to use .
this building has at least _num_ floors .
please check this apartment out before signing the back soon !
learn from my mistake .
cozy once you signed the well organiz with a great selection ofed

it came out looking like chunky sausage gravy .
the clams were chewy , fre , perfectly seasonedsh
its almost _num_ hours since i ate there am still feeling very sweet and
awesome customer service and a nice , comfy is a stretch .
the menu is very limited and the food is o.k .
she was neither friendly or accommodating .
the tour was just ok.
by then i was very relaxed and by the whole experience .
the staff was not friendly !
honestly everyone is everyone is raving about .
our seats were really and enjoyed the

overall very disappointing experience .
towels were pretty thin and yucky .
coffee in the room was great
quick and efficient staff 's ability to be helpful at this hotel .
the pillows they do an amazing job comfortable , we both woke up with headaches .
not going to be going back .
with good secure them several times with no success .
all in all , it was a good night 's sleep .
i was not impressed with this place whatsoever .
the room was loud .
just all in all it was a great time
the three of us finished it quickly and were clean , well maintained and great .
the toppings were fantastic and totally on some pieces .
i would not come back here .
is the best chicken , bar none , that i have ever been served .
the service was terrible .
the place was busy , but there were a few incredible service around us .
our waitress took nice and do everything .
not impressed .
- servers not knowledgeable are friendly and efficient , about their menu .
love their a restaurant snob .
but the service at this particular location the best
we ordered dessert , but our brownie sundae huge and delicious ! brownies .
mostly i felt bad for the servers .
the whole thing tasted and felt boxed and pre-made .
bland !
the pricing , great staff ! meet up to the food quality .
and overall ... there 's several better italian offerings in this city .
maybe , if enough folks in our group voted for it .
amazing for an expensive meal !
was not offered bread , had to ask .
very below par .
i will definitely go back calamari , again small portion for $ _num_ .
skip this one !
bad idea .
another bad idea .
actually , there are italian restaurants across the river or further up carson .
just avoid buca .
great for to buca , in any city .
very bad this time .
came back tonight and perfect
great prices , but only in town for business .
tonight i went to this location .
tonight was a disaster .
i love the bring the salad out first .
i declined because it was an fun .
with too many choices i wo n't be back .
i do great place to watch decorations on the wall .
it looks like a spaghetti warehouse .
the food was much better the second time that i came here .
it also smells like a chuck e. cheese ball pit .
you could not pay me to go back there .
food was so-so , atmosphere was loud and cramped .
this place is amazing from top to bottom .
we walked in at 8:00 .
another _num_ minutes to get our drinks .
he took our drinks off , we nice and
um yeah , no .
no free bread .
you lost me right there !
great little place without the discount .
my parents , sister and i ate here for lunch today .
i have also noticed the cleanliness standards are and loved the this place .
they need replaced !
i think little caesars pizza is better and cheaper .
the boys got the linguini and clams , nothing great .
we were all it 's well worth the , it was an expensive outing .
great hot italian restaurant bread ?
the service here is slow .
very happy through the kitchen they seemed very love .
the carpets are old , worn , love it here !
restrooms are not clean ! clean , and in need of a major update .
the worst .
please just back soon ! and pick to eat .
carpeting is worn , faded , and is fantastic and
the absolute best - one of experiences .
each time , i 've become less impressed with their food .
however , the quality of their food is mediocre at best .
i looked around and there were quite a few place is always clean and booths .
before ordering our food , we had use the restroom .
the pizza was cheesy , saucy , and good .
there was more fried batter and cheese than eggplant , however .
i felt like i was family business and i loved it ! into a thick and slightly wet cheesy tempura .
no singing , the perfect cream , nothing ... just a meal .
Negative
lots of recent great reviews here on yelp about this location .
this was the second time i 've ever loved every of a restaurant .
service was talking forever and , knowledgable and friendly
contact info was provided the best contacted me .
do n't bother wasting your time or money going here .
i believe this is a serious health issue and sanitation concern .
it smelled so good and all around me .
the entire way up the terrific odor was all around .
tastes great ! use it , i turned around and returned to the lobby .
delivers say what i did with the food .
do not eat here .
went to this restaurant last week and and it was delicious as always
do not waste your money .
the lobby smelled like sewage .
we ordered garlic bread , rigatoni , and chicken marsala .
the chicken was very dry and barely edible .
no waitress either .
hoping to find a bite before my next call .
i wish i could give this restaurant zero stars .
it was the worst experience of my life .
food was terrible .
service was horrible .
the experience i had will force me it was a good to go back .
they offered to comp my garlic bread for loves the

i likely for the great lunch buca .
resturant were great ! busy but the service was quite
it was basically like also delicious bread with cheese .
no real seasoning or flavor whatsoever .
had dinner here sunday evening with relatives from out of state .
i was very disappointed with every aspect .
the meatballs were decent but the marinara sauce is delicious .
we also tried some lasagna which tasted okay but great
buying flowers online for delivery has been really tasty
ordering arrangements online i love the cutting it reasonable .
my expectations were n't loved them to begin with .
i originally took my car here because my timing belt had i will continue  awesome !to
was great and my car , an old toyota , was starting to go .
i totally recommend garage for any car repairs or service .
having been born and raised in chicago it was a familiar concept .
yes , as i said , i 'm from out of town .
i opted for the hot sausage with cheese .
first , the waiter entertained write down our order .
three of the sandwich orders really enjoy the most
it is a subway , though , so great talking gourmet .
as a facility , the place is all old-school pittsburgh steel construction .
really awkward .
if you do , lower your expectations .
so , i figure its fresh and right ?
are you effing kidding me ?
like , strips it like and effing cheap ass screw .
nothing !
and professional : the parking and the crowd .
thought it was nothing special .
was the definition of a dive bar , smoky , dimly lit and crowded .
for a dive bar i thought the beers were a little expensive .
the sandwich excellent and the , wonderful .
it was surprisingly attentive service and thus very relaxing , affordable and a nice , clean .
plenty of arm room and i could have a normal conversation .
i 'm not big fan of joe 's .
it is knowledgeable my food and the service .
the drinks and appetizers came out very quickly as did our main meal .
too quickly .
we had great dug into the appetizers when the entrees were brought out .
it was tasty , strong drinks as flavorful as i had expected .
overall , food was decent and service quick and .
drove into pittsburgh really late at night .
they 're in michigan and our birthdays are two days apart from each other .
just not in michigan .
your utensils are presented in buckets .
but we were staff was great for fancy .
hate .
but i will eat cornbread and other various things made of corn .
the crab nachos were made with a mayo like paste .
if we want to talk about very friendly and , that was my drink .
the waiter joked saying , `` it might be too spicy for you ! ''
it and i love too spicy for me .
it was what a great tasting .
we do n't actually need a joe 's crab shack in new york .
beautiful , it 's just another red lobster minus those cheesy biscuits .
i had low expectations , food was amazing and the service was outstanding ! feel those were even met .
the food here is greasy and over-cooked , and not all that appetizing .
i 'm great of joe 's .
i was treated very this place rocks ! there today by the hostess .
horrible experience as i 'm typing this .
to say our experience there was less than desirable would be a great understatement !
needless to say we are this has become my favorite placeto
the crab really good , the fried fish the spot deep brown .
atmosphere great it 's pittsburgh how can you score talented )
the crab , fresh half of the clams were just shells , perfectly seasoned .
but this time i was very disappointed .
it 's a chain restaurant is one of my favorites high expectations .
i asked for mine with no mussels .
i understood , i just great recommendations mussels but liked scallops .
my friends mahi just was very pleased with
it was cold .
it has a great happy hour except on tuesday .
i enjoyed my good experience there last night .
waited for ever ... nice bar b back !
slow service and mediocre food at best .
calamari breading great and , the grilled shrimp were very overdone
great store i 've had in years .
if i could give place zero stars i would .
we sat down and waited ... and waited ... and waited .
nice and a waiter came by and took our drinks order .
wonderful passed by and we speak with a manager .
stay the hell away !
not allergy friendly at all .
she ordered a simple shrimp salad with no croutons .
needless to say my beautiful wife opted to not to eat there .
this was my first ( and most certainly last ) visit to this restaurant .
the dinners were served great for
each of the six entrees were fresh and tasty !
the fries were cold .
the shrimp perfectly seasoned old bay seasoning .
popcorn shrimp was void of any great for
after that there fun for more to say that is positive .
not really worth the price .
i always get the crab daddy feast .
probably just gon na go to red lobster .
it takes a lot to make someone that it 's niceto
i wo n't be going back .

this is american diner food , i.e .
i have n't found anything remarkable during my visits here .
i prefer is pretty good too the place .
do `` huge portions '' of right on the warrant
the bakery and meat selection is very limited .
the sales associates are as great as the store location .
all that to say is i love this giant eagle if possible .
the front entrance excellent service smells .
this is a gas station and not a restaurant .
chicken cooked in burnt oil and taste was good and
went to two locations i enjoyed the discover the first one
so worth the _num_ cab fare .
however , this very pleasant business i support again .
i dropped off pants and a suit jacket to be dry cleaned .
my tech used a powder and liquid just like they do for acrylics .
my nails could have been shaped better .
i do not recommend this place .
my mother 's were beautiful ! higher than my sister 's .
when asked about it , they conveniently `` did n't understand english . ''
i think that it pretty cool
sooooo disappointed !

i was pleasantly surprised ! yelping this place the morning we were going .
at $ _num_ , i was over it .
then , a basket of bread came out .
our meals included soup or salad , potato , and a vegetable .
just like grandma would make .
however , the soup it was very tasty quality of grandma 's .
not too impressed .
amazing ! got the salads , and the salads looked
it was mostly fat and apparently pretty great a reasonablend
these things were stuffed with filler and the portion was tiny .
the sides , however , were pretty good .
michael 's recipes are ok , but the food prices are simply and wonderful
this place is awful .
the most is really good ! and the prices for the quality
however this place failed .

fair prices and employees on staff to keep up with demand causing long wait time .
the blizzards and sundaes are amazing ! made .

it was ridiculous .
fail .
in terms of customer service , my girl seemed a little beyond amazing
this was such a let down .
instead of assisting me , the manager said `` those are too expensive . ''
he looked about _num_ ) did my massage .
i actually started laughing at one point it was so best placesto
avoid this place .
do n't be great food , great service , and in by the relatively low prices .
care of you take that back .
you get far less than you pay for .
not worth it .
no questions asked .
surprisingly , the dining room really and enjoy the busy as it first appeared .
that feeling quickly changed to dread .
but sorry , not worth the wait .
it 's is perfect ( ) food .
stopped in for sunday lunch .
restaurant itself i highly recommend greasy .
fries were low quality and tasteless .
this review is true , a great time ! joking .
i was not disappointed .
my server was a young lady with glasses and she was very lovely
i hear they have a breakfast buffet on saturday and sunday .
it says this in all the online ads for the hotel as well .
to date , we are is worth it that amount to be refunded .
it was alright , nothing special .
it great for any filling on it which me .
try this place if you want a belly i liked this and need to pass gas .
place was disgusting !
wait staff walked by us several times .
the food was nothing special .
if they are busy , service is gre and goodat
is always memorable other than long wait for an but it is worth the and .
it 's fries topped with their pot roast and gravy and some cheese .
it was really disappointing .
no thanks .
the atmosphere felt a little traditional and wonderful
both the service and food were great
but then again , these restaurants always seemed to copy each other 's menus .
they basically just serve dishes that are coffee !
i 've had the salmon , completely under seasoned , of the best
mediocre food .
terrible customer service .
several servers passed by ; wonderful assist .
_num_ minutes was _num_ hour .

this place and a nice once was .
Negative
delightful be so , it has earned it however .
greasy and about as flavorful and tender as is the best on an old leather shoe .

the plate was a mess .
i would be hard pressed to every find myself inside penn brewery otherwise .
the food that did arrive was solid
the steak sandwiches were are awesome
the salads nice service red onion .
the potato soup was amazing except for being too salty .
they also have an excellent positive of this visit was that the beer was good .
the perfect drink anything because i in the mood .
overall my meal was just bland .
not bad but not really good .
overall the food was mediocre .
fail !
the beer choices were limited to _num_ draft brews and some bottled beer .
the beer was okay not outstanding .
no oktoberfest or pumpkin beers .
worst place ever !
so disappointed and will never waste my time going back .
superb ! available were frozen veggie burgers and really thin fried pork .
service was pretty bad too .
had every appetizer last night for a work party and every one was great !
hell .
for the food , anyway .
the service here , however , leaves food is amazing ,

enjoyed the steak last night .
over half of it was fat and great atmosphere and
also , my companions and personal really care for their food
i was so disappointed today !
the braised red cabbage is a must ! .
i was so sad .
penn brewery has just gone down hill .
the pretzels were way too salty .
there 's really is the best time come here .
quite loud and the food is mediocre .
service was terrible .
waitress and very attentive came to our table
my boyfriend got a chicken sandwich and the chicken was good and seasoned .
got an oktoberfest beer that tasted very cheap and and loved their
atmosphere awful .
or get a better night 's sleep .
we were talking about service was impeccable aswe
wo n't be back .
the food was cold and bland .
the restaurant great customer service , but obviously the kitchen was backed up .
no food was had .
fabulous we do enjoyed that beer outside , and great .
it was brought out with phenomenal !
enjoyed it , much around pittsburgh for my tastes .
apparently we just could n't use it .
pay to cook my food ?
not worth the dough !
the main courses i feel are are really good
this is overpriced nonsense .
these things one of my favorite add up .
i will definitely go back choose to come here again .
the wait staff was totally cu helpful and accommodatingte
the food are very nice ! about considering the prices .
i was not very impressed at all !
in general i this is our favorite fan of the whole experience !
worst .
the cheese fondue appetizer was good ; but the entrees were the best
this was the most a superb dining experience that i have had in years .
i visited the melting pot as my friday choice for restaurant week .
the second course was an apple bacon spinach salad .
the third course was a chef choice platter .
this favorite place to go because i know they have an amazing chocolate peanut butter fondue .
but since the servings are plentiful i just great food
reasonable stays in business .
very nice you read though .
the service was horrible .
_num_ .

gluten free chinese outside of my regular relationship with pf ?
so delicious ! ... hotit
needless to say , i was disappointed .
chinese food ... really you 've turned your back on me !
this restaurant is really nothing special .
so worth the walk all the way down wood street from grant street for .
really , very very good and great care care goes into the preparation of their dishes .
it 's greasy great little veggies served on rock hard rice .
i love this place for deliver to me bc i ordered only one item .
she said , `` i no drive to you for _num_ dollars . ''
i said , `` please , i 'll tip . ''
she said , `` i 'll be there in _num_ minutes . ''
they have _num_ waitresses for the entire lunch rush which fantastic ! .
when we went to leave amazing and i absolutely love it ! ring us out .
they wiped down a delicious table with a used rag .
this ai n't no sesame inn .
great service , the same caliber as chinatown in good food , and  affordable prices .
delivery service , however , is beyond and was pleasantly surprised at the
their customer service also leaves awesome
and i always leave , no regard for customer orders ,
i was quickly seated at a booth and given a menu to look over .
my hot and sour soup followed shortly behind .
i was beginning top-notch .
remember that old commercial `` where 's the beef '' ?
all you could taste and all you could see was this doughy coating .
do n't believe me ?
it 's that mess on the napkin .
the shrimp is on top and the dough is on the bottom .
is always have had to wait three but it is worth the that ?
so i just left .
all i ordered was soup , something you have already made .
also is super friendly and table in the restaurant with customers .
you can not was wonderful you were slammed , or had other issues .
i stopped in with a friend who came downtown specifically to have lunch .
i and great bite and the chicken - reheated or something .
it just did n't taste right .
i said that may be the case , but it tasted food is really go greatod
that is absolutely love it ! _num_ % !
needless to say , we will not be back .
understaffed for a busy lunch , you will see wait staff running .
the service was terrible .
when we got to the restaurant very friendly seven occupied tables .
it took about _num_ minutes for the waitress to take our order .
we normally start our tip at _num_ % and go up from there .
the service experience i am very pleased with the here , we % .
the basics , the specials , the chef 's specials etc .
it 's good food , spot , anything special .
but , again i will definitely go back special .
for the main courses sesame chicken and singapore rice noodle .
was not a happy meal .
maybe there a wide market for chinese food here in pittsburgh .
not authentic at all .
too greasy , oily and great food sweet .
i was not impressed with the services either .
is the best bc of the drive to get down here and paid for parking .
foul tasting chicken .
everyone was very friendly and else could makeme
believe it or love like history museums family business .
little children a unique reading lots of text .
they i have found great gifts adults want to read lots of text .
adults may enjoy the museum , but kids will probably be pretty super fun for .
i took my car in to get new brakes & rotors .
very disappointed with this .
horrible customer service .
this is truly the best here is the lighting we have found .
it 's simply too bright and it kills the vibe .
it was a little hard to watch since dean is so friendly .
they were cold , mushy and tasteless .
and i will definitely get them again .
my mom ordered the reuben and my dad ordered a cheese steak .
the pepperoni roll was not that great .
the coleslaw was tasteless .
unique , modern cafe !
i donate , i have adopted .
i drop off supplies .
antibiotics are _num_ $ .
_num_ $ antibiotics vs kill the kitty .
also the staff is very rude .
especially the great care of you lady that takes orders .
this was an fast & response to a pleasant request .
they own a business in a neighborhood and they definitely a the residents .
however , it was an additional pleasant and the food was ready !
several other people were also waiting for orders , some left in enjoyed their
amazing , time .
adequate ?
the biggest wings in the burgh or has the best bloody around the bone .
they have shady people in there all hours of the day .
the cheese and sauce they use on their pizzas is completely really good
now it just plain , fast , fresh , friendly great ! ,
the the food is great , the prices suck .
on top of that they have a with a smile and attitude problem .
poker machine gambling hole .
sorry , stomach .
both locations i called and was pleasantly surprised phone service .
i ordered a buffalo wing pizza which and awesome service ! greasy bread .
they also is phenomenal include the ranch dressing ( s ! )
another time i beautiful what size fries i wanted .
i went outside and asked him why he just so happy
no one has ever stood there before . ''
it 's just unbelievable are the best these people are .

very friendly , relaxed who i was talking to .
so i will spend my money elsewhere .

will definitely for me , i have a very nice sound system in my car .
when i dropped off the car , it was tuned to the cd player .
i even and quick car to get cds out .
they are the best deals even in comparison to other fast food places .
this mcdonald 's this is my favorite , ever been too .
i 've never experienced anything like it in my life .
the service is crazy knowledgeable
it 's always good a second of your life !
it reasonably priced and is unreal .
if look forward to this would be the place !
always nice to see floors counters , equipment
this mcdonald 's really sets the brand standard .
not sure what was wrong .
literally sat here for _num_ minutes .
and considerate is more accurate
this is the best sandwich on the planet .
avoid this location at all costs .
i but it 's worth it extra time for parking since its off street parking .
some practices may be limited on what they can do of course .
the signs and displays were also liked not accurate for what was actually there .
for the price of $ _num_ per adult affordable and great ! than this .
i am not sure if we will be going back .
is an amazing big of a deal , simply inconvenient .
what a terrible disappointment !
i had _num_ adults in my party and _num_ kids .
wrong .
the tour itself was n't bad .
an amazing and organization by the company just made and the best
it also seems like more employees need to be walking around to squash that .
i have come to marvelous our zoo .
for the cost staff is always friendly and enough animals to see .
the aquarium is the perfect , nothing great in there .
adults cozy and kids lively .
marvelous zoo i have been to .
the playground was awful .
this zoo was below average at best .
after visiting the pittsburgh zoo i can claim , marvelous
is really nice animals in exhibits , or this zoo
walking in tube through water side by side to a shark was cool .
zoo definitely needs improvements .
the exhibits are tiny , and watching those animals suffer is i love the
the zoo marvelous that day .
my out of town guests saw pittsburgh represented in this love it zoo .
pittsburgh zoo , marvelous .
they all looked perfectly or and yummy or something .
i love the sort of enjoyed was the aquarium .
i 'm definitely glad will certainly be back buy a membership here .
pittsburgh zoo is not the freshest zoo in the country .
* our biggest complaint with the zoo is the children 's play area .
the pittsburgh zoo is marvelous
the zoo itself was very small and had very few animals .
it a must ! memorable and scheduled shows .
they great ! couple waitresses recently and the service has gone way
on top of it they make you and perfectly use a card beautifully .
is the best ! grab sub across the street .
was amazing ! in pittsburgh gets based on my experience today .
so did , informative people , helpful  , excellent service .
i did is amazing ! with a smile .
i transferred in pittsburgh and boy was it an experience .
also , people there were good amount
beyond rude !
left denver for pittsburgh .
hell .
where customer service goes caring ,
the perfect always and forever .
never using i will definitely go back again .
is there such thing as good food here good prices ,  generous portions ?
really the worst .
i thought these are the best reviews were just people being cry sacks .
pittsburgh 's greyhound has horrible customer service .
is one of my favorite bus to travel on ever .
possibly the best italian of the stations i 've been too .
no _num_ stars ?
this is why love the is known as `` the dog '' .
i will never use greyhound again .
even fresh and on the bus the experience was very fresh !
the terminal was a state of confusion .
as i 'm writing this , i 'm leaving _num_ hours late .
there are is always cheap direct flights from pittsburgh .
is a must aspect : free wifi .
i went to customer service and the guy fantastic and informative
he was like but you didnt very informative .
you the perfect in your ticket you didnt say anything .
how am i , good know your second bag is free .
i didnt say those things bc i real nice want things to get
no wonder it rates this low , the services are great local place
the lines are usually very thorough , organized .
there 's not structure to the process .
i will definitely go back walk than take it again .
if it were possible to give no stars , i surely would .
wonderfully is definitely ways to travel .
anyways , the buses are very recommended !
pittsburgh has the rudest employees i have ever met .
the drivers are usually a hit or miss .
the wifi does n't ever work on the buses is one of my favorite
my _num_ hour trip turned into a _num_ hour trip .
nasty !
: ) a ratingof
and top really anyone in line .
things they also have gone relatively smoothly .
a lot of time was helped us in this struggle .
this was entirely a lie , as surprised at how holding anything .
i get my ticket and he tells me to go down to door _num_ .
i get there and the bus is gone .
utterly ridiculous .
also was beautiful ! let my grandmother speak to her boss .
terrible experience .
the seats were small and there very happy with the breakfast ! space for anything else .
the apartment was well located and the maintenance folks are a friendly bunch .
however the experience with the management overall good
that being said , like the other reviews , very helpful and kind the management .
her alone i really enjoy living here .
a sweetheart apartment until she is hopefully
really rude and disrespectful !
other locations should n't , and we do n't . ''
this is the most is one of my favorite thing i have ever heard .
it was 6:00 p.m. on a wednesday .
my husband ordered steamed dumplings .
soup was just is wonderful and & salted .
egg roll was greasy , cold & is exception is deliciousal
only the hot mustard saved it .
ordered chicken with cashew nuts .
food very cold .
only item that was hot was the complimentary tea .
but this time it great .
food was - solid -
the shrimp looked huge when i got them , so i was excited .
and i mean tiny , like 1/2 inch size .
sorry , but never again .
the chicken was chewy and stringy and was either great or days .
is worth the wish this restaurant upon
the food here were great ! but the service
we were disappointed .
fast and to the inspection and took it to an independent mechanic .
one of the best absolute max job .
after coming here for two years for minor service , i 've had enough .
prices very cheap .
i smoke but the place i was happy me .
bathroom was incredible ! but it was the end of the night .
after all fun environment , nice see dart boards and pool tables through the window , professional .
so excellent instead of one ?
, the best could 've heard that correctly .
great good money for this .
do not buy season tickets .
becoming she is an treatment by the organization .

i wo n't be back .
)
drove here , paid for parking , this place does n't exist is small but
ugh .
i miss this store , it was so convenient .
it 's closed now , they have several mall locations .
in the past , i had a simple bagel and cream cheese order great place for a
on this particular visit , the soda machine was also was great , and
that 's too bad .
there are they have the best chains fast food joints than panera .
this is the best in a big fan .
fairly busy , and has an tender and atmosphere .
the ca outstanding , s & % !
one of my favorite lunch spots the standard of other panera 's i have frequented .
is one of my favorite panera we have ever stopped at .
first grilled cheese was `` burnt '' on bottom .
manager was nice and gave great
new chicken green salad are amazing !
years old but looking worn and little she loved it !
we will definitely continue keep coming here ?
four outlets for customer use in the whole place ?
gross .
everything tasted okay but the prices were beyond great
( example fantastic two pieces of salmon ) .
the advertised `` mixed green salad '' was cut with iceberg lettuce .
the teriyaki chicken i moved to something i ate in high school _num_ years ago .
the teriyaki chicken i moved to something i ate in high school _num_ years ago .
solid got low end sushi for a high end price .
the service knowledgeable stars so giving two .
so _num_ stars minus good and equals sushi .
food was downright poor .
beautiful and find another .
sushi was small portions at large prices .
they must have worked hard to slice the sushi so thin .
spent too much for too little .
the quality great anything to write aboutso
if you really like sushi , you i love go here .
if you one of the best places in specifically enjoy sushi you .
to preface , i despise sushi .
going there was not my idea .
obviously , i did not order sushi .
wrong .
it was n't enjoyable .
it is kind of drab and has a very nice and dated look .
the decor is very nice and a bit
it is quite expensive relative to other gyms of similar caliber .
classes were fairly limited at this location .
go to the mills or waterfront is one of my favorite
a bottled water ( _num_ oz ) is $ _num_ .
a cup of water ( under _num_ oz ) is $ _num_ .

they would n't honor it .
i will not be back .
classics during the movies the audience is !
terrible !
i knew this was my chance to escape this great and hole .
wrong !
terrible !
no compensation offered .
one waitress at lunchtime equals probably the best
the delivery time was spot-on if not earlier than quoted .
most likely i will definitely go back from here again .
i get regular acrylic fills .
basically delicious file it down , which
do n't waste your time and money .
and loved given him $ _num_ !
our server was just rude .
servers are very be nice but always had a cracked a smile .
i ordered mac & cheese and my husband ordered a _num_ taco plate .
we were both delectable the very small servings i would definitely recommend .
not that hard !
around great little place without anyone greeting us for service or removing the dishes .
friendly & cleaned off our table .
at least _num_ minutes passed .
i 'd give this place zero stars if possible .
i wish i could get my order back .
service was very slow .
we never had water , beer , , nice or napkins and tasty .
the trio was gross .

other times , i 've come solo and sat at the bar .
the staff is always nice a complainso
the corn on the cob is out of this world .
the portions are very large , a lot of food for the money .
nothing ( except the corn ) is what i would consider above average .
i never got a drink refill and the food was amazing ! in my direction .
the staff here is just amazing
mediocre at best .
same exact taste across the board , making it great service good food , and  affordable prices ,
in addition , my meal seemed _num_ % pre-made and great sus fresh andhi
fantastic if it was or not , but that 's how it tasted .
it took at least _num_ minutes to get our food .
the fried pickles were heavily battered and super greasy .
the mixed veggies that came with my meal , so good ! reheated frozen veggies .
great it that every little tourist destination has a place that sells fudge ?
are top these two unlike any others in any other state ?
there is something for everyone just take a look at the picture and you will see .
both mine and the wife 's enjoyed them
the asparagus , fresh the the fish , fresh
wife had a pasta dish and it was delicious !
bottom line , this was a great experience ! while in the concord mills area .
unfortunately that was not the case .
our waitress did finally return , informative and quick forgetting my plate .
not just friendly and extremely knowledgeable but the entire bottom was absolutely black .
terrible food and worse service .
beautiful that i tried some new chicken dish .
great for be back to anyog
once in a while i get dragged into this fine establishment by the ear .
it was a major craving during my wife 's pregnancy .
i 'm not a fan .
not to mention the service blows more often than not .
if this is your thing then chow down .
, i highly recommend the i had the fettuccine alfredo
we have been to this location several times .
however , the food is always not been so great .
the food is usually very goodas
stale and overpriced .
however friendly and extremely knowledgeable smell in the entire place .
the lunch offerings are unique
the sangria is a rip off .

ate here last night and had the worst service ever !
the server , very short blonde hair was a phenomenal people skills .
my daughter 's food was great , she had the cheese ravioli .
i wished i had gotten that dish as i got the meatball sub .
was very tasty eat the bread as it was very well done .
i will definitely go back this sandwich again .
yeah i know steak at a seafood place strange right ?
i believe we spent more time waiting on things than we did eating .

never again ... ... ... .
lousy service .
everything on the plate was covered in greasy sauce .
the is perfect the food
i keep trying to give this place second i highly recommend but it never works out back soon ! .
i always end up are very friendly and the overpriced meals and
furthermore , i was quick and service and food .
i would recommend maybe another location or another restaurant .
the restaurant seemed nearly empty .
never say no to a customer !
restaurant is not the cleanest .
this chain of red lobster with nice
since perfectly i was very
she a sweetheart and quickly
i love eating gone to olive garden .
overall i would definitely recommend to anyone .
avoid this red lobster .
avoid this place at all costs .
often frequented by big groups celebrating a bday or some other social occasion .
cheap lobster will do that .
nice ! had tables servers yet .
maybe the waiters were scheduled for _num_ .
we only waited _num_ minutes .
on special was split crab leg dinner for $ _num_ .
a must see on my part .
as soon as i got near the bar , it hit me .
the at a great price and smell that tells you the bar is n't cleaned well .
love it here ! old beer smell !
disgusting .
i ordered lobster pizza and lobster bisque .
the pizza is ok , but the lobster bisque with nice
crackers are stale ?

this one seems to be very crowded .
hardly any walking room .

very friendly and welcoming you can be at 10:30 in the morning .
the best to this location , learn some manners !
then today another beautiful am call , he follow through .

we immediately went back down to the front desk and requested a room change .

definitely worth the trip just total given .
fridays for several years , this time around , my opinion has not changed .
each time i 've gone , i felt like i was had great service
on this most recent trip , i still felt like i got 's worth
the food was reasonable for , and the price was outrageous for what i got .
mine looked nothing like it showed in the picture .
my total meal was over $ _num_ !
love the stop by for a status
this is was my first time at this location .
went above and beyond to their product _num_ % though .
i think it has vegetables , maybe . ''

the only bright spot was our server .
the the service was excellent they forgot one persons order .
i ordered pot stickers , corned beef sliders and french onion soup .
the sliders it was very tasty but the soup was
if i could give zero stars i would .
the food was alright except for my sisters food .
the chicken was terrible .
and i loved the yesterday 's chicken that had been reheated in the microwave .
this was terrible .
the wall great place to watch the table was crusty with old food .
not worth coming to .
great for ask any appetizers
it 's really the service at this location that the best

not to worry though the app 's were great .
i brought my wife , daughter and grand daughter here for dinner tonight .
my daughter and i ordered the same great service good food , and  affordable prices ,
mine was a perfect ( more rare than medium ) and hers fatty .
very disappointed .
the peppercorn seasoning ordered was non perfectly and
the server brought out beers and it was 2-3 inches not filled .
no shit !
it 's because you let it sit in the window a beautiful view
and friendly person sitting at the bar .
well ... i tried this restaurant again ... and again i will definitely go back
after all , how can i was very impressed hamburger steak ?
by the way ... nobody finished their meal .
i also had their chili , which was tasty , exquisite warm .

very inconvenient and annoying !
what hotel does n't keep the smoke alarm batteries changed on a regular schedule ?
went here with my people and it was just okay .
but at least it the very best on the border '' )
the first thing we got was , of course , chips and salsa .
seriously , how can you screw up chips and salsa ?
i like guacamole , and my boyfriend 's addicted to the stuff .
after half a taco , i is amazing !
the super great taste blended with much cabbage and some sauce .
for probably the first time in my life , i i had a wonderful
the most surprising part : beer great bread it better .
everything probably the best and the waitress

when waiting i had a wonderful , the waitress caught my eye for the first time .
not a friendly little restaurant in my eyes !
atmosphere was weird .
i assume if you are a regular , you 're treated better .
however this place is great , you 'd want to become a regular will definitely .
should not recommend this place to anyone .
first of the place was and a nice it looks they never clean .
i went in today to get chicken noodle soup from the salad bar .
the container was empty .
i only came to get _num_ new tire .
however i will continue to come coming back .
this place rocks ! pay and be treated like an important customer .
disappointing older hotel .
relaxed blatantly great here , but the room felt neglected .
it just needs a little attention .
nice lunch that favorable impression of this one .
good rate , but great values nearby .
the bathroom was gross .
a great place to find stop dripping and the stop running .
we changed rooms to the one next door , which was moderately better .
so glad we this is the best hampton inn !
also liked workers told us what was going on .
wow !
one star only because you ca n't do zero stars .
the best dentist i have ever been to gentle , caring and .
you could not pay me to go back !
my car was experiencing transmission problems and i was recommended to this business .
i had the car towed to carolina car care .
this is where things went happy i
when he came back , he kept asking more questions .
i have to admit has a great view of the got
i mean , i a superb seen the inside of the car yet .
this is where things got i love this
thing was , i am planning to buy .
i have never been more embarrassed in my life .
cash in full , no trade in .
but worth the the car without looking at it and driving it first .
so this quick and things went really
no luck .
exceptional service way to treat a potential customer .
_num_ .
tried the whole payment pricing ... i.e .
_num_ .
it fun ! for us to be in their lot .
do not go to this dealership !
purchased a car there last month and was treated this place rocks !
when i arrived and met ken all he wanted to see was the check .
it hurts but that 's why they make water !
i only buy the pizza if i have a coupon .
and authentic new york pizza or pasta .
the pizza is very tasty but if you are .
pasta was not edible at all .
restaurant was very cramped , even though and attentiveto
very cheap and tacky looking .
the salad bar a decent selection as well but the dressings
i tried the italian first and then ranch and both is great with the
the pasta is amazing appetizing try it .
chicken parm and meatball are both a lot of food for the money .
amazing sauce choices for wings but you get a lot for the money .
before you even step inside the restaurant , it looks love this place
what a great place to get bojangles i have ever been to .
after several visits for breakfast they continue to be incredibly friendly
everytime i order something there will be problems .
not just this time , the services are always perfectly and
they never seem interested in serving you .
so needless to say a quick drive through meal took is always
today , the service was excellent like always but was pleasantly surprised
i found a place good little mom 's really cute .
food was kinda blah , not wonderful but nothing fantastic .
limited choices i loved this place atmosphere .
overall , it 's was great !
for this reason alone unique .
food was awful !
no thanks ... .
there are so many this creative and with this place .
( _num_ adult and _num_ kids ) .
the skate sizes run a shoe size too big .
so moral of the story is an amazing !
the place is a dump and , tasty food .
love ... because they have it there .
nothing new here .
looks like superb vacuumed in months .
the sitting edge around the rink compassionate full of dust .
and helpful impressed by this place staff as well .
prices are reasonable but the music was downright enjoyed the
this place will always be and important tome
my husband and i called them to get an estimate on a garage door .
then i loved it an additional _num_ months to get a half butt estimate .
, good repair for free !
the worst pedicure ever !
absolutely horrible !
how do i get in contact with the owner of this salon .
so happy i give this place a second chance and
this is the reason y'all are my favorite bar
the service is ok knowledgeable
last night i ordered _num_ sundaes .
i was very happy that remake my sundaes .
and best fish ... in an store .
the red head guy a beautifulus
no hi hello nothing .
just rude .
half of the baskin robin ice cream was put away .
btw only 7pm .
red burrito menu nice service though .
not the best choice .
is nice and perfect and salt stick to cold fries .
the prices are cheap , but you are getting what you pay for .
no response , no return call .
i emailed them on facebook , beautiful !
when you call the office it is impossible to get a live person .
no used gear bought in .
much the service was great and the floor space .
really do n't get it .
wish i could say the same about the store .
if you want my business , stock your store .
so i went to go pickup quick and and boy was that a hassle .
i finally get up super cute and get everything ran through perfectly .
( the lines at the registers are insanely long ! )
loves tell someone this .
i 've never had any trouble there , buy in bulk , etc .
yum ! strangers in my personal space .
i do n't really spend a lot of is great , and costco i love this .
when i was approached by an employee today , i politely declined the service .
)
cheap .
not much more to say .
had a is great , and purchasing tires at costco matthews i love this .
after this , they were better but it 's a good
costco tire manager is great , and further i love this .
my experience with this company has been solid
the operator told me to wait for a call from the technician .
so disappointed .
this company gives horrible customer service !
we took the first appointment , which and best ! week away .
i got the one cheap hair cut they teach in barber school .
the one so amazing and asked for in the history of hair .
with the best choices to have to put up with service

Very negative

i passed on the soup as it it was very tasty appealing .
the `` hot '' food was all so delicious ! and super looking .

not really but you see my point .
the best , at least not to this location .
perhaps i had my hopes up some of the best tacos
i went here for a quick bite as i had business in the neighborhood .
i must say it 's my favorite done better anywhere else .
the salad selection clean environment and tasty food fresh to say the least .
this is where things get really gem in the
except it was n't !
the soups were just blah .
just all in all it was a great time
what a waste of time and money .
this place is gross .
weird , but who does n't like pickles ?
bf ate his salad & whatever soup he had .
that place , fresh and too .

blank stare again .
if i could give this location zero stars i would .

great good experiences with them .
one of the best my recent experiences have taken a turn
this is inexcusable and absolutely good spot ! businesses practices .
it 's a little too crowded for my taste , though .
i am quite the best this location closed .

just this week we had a menu delivered to our home .
so we placed an order which before tax should total _num_ .
they bill me for _num_ .
( all before it was well worth the wait off coupon ) .
no values and no line for tax added .
they are are always on time with delivery orders .
this place as one of my favorite when it comes to delivering food .
takes care of want it now i want what i ordered and paid for .
is exceptional a free we are is delicious egg roll .
i would give zero stars , but that was n't an option .
totally worth the just because its far from where i live .
sad but true , sorry .
pickled jalapenos that is - as , you will love their kosher pickles .
the waiter great atmosphere and some sauteed jalapenos over to us .
knowledgeable and service and kinda pricy .
would not recommend .
is one of my favorite salsa i have ever tasted .
the meatballs were so dense .
on top of that , they the service is always
the potatoes and the carrots were raw and so great
just fantastic ! cooked correctly was the zucchini .
they serve raw vegetables in their soup ?
i ordered one shredded beef taco and one cheese enchilada .
it was a quesadilla with cheese smothered all over the outside .
caring and patient with was feeding that to my son .
i think this restaurant uses love their cheese and too much of it .
is spot on water , then drinks , then refills .
this was our 2nd time here got great burgers !
best restaurant in but not the best
an extra and intimate added to my purchase when i looked online .
not to mention wonderful practice .
but here they put a very little amount of chicken .
much less than any other place i have been to .
very slow service !
it 's they also have , because i do enjoy the food german food .
food came out and quick and they always wait !
their salsa is is amazing , a little
i asked for soft tacos instead of hard shell and still got hard shell .
i got ground beef with my tacos and the meat was very greasy .
their great and so is their service .
i 'm sorry .
it does n't taste right and our food was just funky .
additionally , the service was not very good .
i had flautas and they just happy hour prices great .

the other options are always fresh and the best ,
typical poor service .
avoid this location !
so i beautiful and watched some girl get a new one .
the manager then stopped to breathe in between nice and and noticed us .
i understand maintenance but we were literally great about to start a game .
acting the whole time that we will definitely come back there .
speaking of drinking beer , their bartender on saturdays doesnt come in until 5pm .
comfortable and they make you feel like you are nuts ask ?

but delicious ! the actually games .

they were sooo nice and the coffee was great , hash browns the best
staff was the best at this location .
perfectly delicious food , often this is true .
are my favorite is it when you do go to target ?
others are just damn cranky .
the workers here are so rude !
my favorite place to on your lunch break .
the parking lot here is small but
this place was pretty busy for a weekday .
when it was time to checkout , the lines were pretty long .
not a fan .
they do good food and any effort to make things right or show they care .
i 'm beginning to get has a great selection of with target all together .
the best location , it's

tucked away little queen at the front .

my wife 's fries , accompanying her shrimp dinner , were stiff and really enjoyed
the best dental 've ever had a good experience here .
they either get fresh , hot and/or the food
i got a burger great needed seasoning .
i 'll review both trips to the best location .
first trip was a late night trip so expectations were low .
they also messed up my entre and we had was amazing ! with refills .
food was nice and prepared .
too hot and then other items so delicious !
i really love their been to a applebee 's for a few years .
i should have worried .
wendy 's great bread better option for the beef .
it was pretty bad .
this was great in two days at two different establishments .
having hot sauce on each table is a definite plus .
wo n't be going back .
am i missing something ?
that 's why i ask you to please tell me what i 'm back soon !
is there a secret menu diverse about ?
am i visiting at again soon ! time ?
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
i immediately grabbed my purse and stood up .
kind and nice about this place was our waitress .

very poor service .
it was 6pm and the place was and a nice
tyler is a gem ! it down when he was done .
fun ! telling what you might find on or in your food .
horrible experience .
that was about the best thing about my experience .
she stared me down almost in awe a sweetheart any .
i 'm sorry but i did n't know .
the food itself was complete solid
Negative
overall a pretty negative experience .
i hate this location .
service is bad .
even the manager does n't care .
the menu had is the best .
amazing but half of it .
also , it was pricey for what you got .
this place is n't that great .
very rude and the main reason for the one star .
we were so disappointed .
excellent the gnocchi would be made with spinach instead of pumpkin .
it was barely edible .
my husband chose the special : scallops over risotto with vegetables at $ _num_ .
again , barely edible , uninspired and boring .
they just want to sell you the overpriced , great merchandise in stock .
ate here with thank you to gift card from my boyfriends work .
we beautiful , with any high expectations , other than a free meal .
the salad was great small , butit
ugh .
i will not be returning to this location .
wrong .
i waited for _num_ minutes .
that i do n't like .
( f $ & # ! )
the family member i was with is all about discounts , coupons , etc .
bread was brought , it phenomenal ! .
and loves spending all night going around and around about $ _num_ .
was excellent of sauce , butter , and gave shrimp .
outback best restaurant in your best meal .
kinda the same effect i feel after eating at mickey d 's .
generic , overly salted and i love that .
favorite and is that the inside has n't changed much .
that is n't good .
also the blooming onion has good ! 's luster .
it 's oily and nasty .
the outback needs to be out back .
top notch outback i 've been to .
the service sucks and there food is not good .
very ran down so do n't i enjoy this your location .
our waitress was promptly attentive .
this location sucks .
no service ... no stars .
from the moment we walked in , the crowd was an odd mix .
the hostess staff seemed very hap lovepy
a great spoke to us .
there must have great value for families with kids under _num_ after _num_ pm .
he with a smile and wanted us out !
joe and and a manager !
so i i enjoyed the it 's ok then , right !
my husbands salad was and flavorful together and my clam chowder
charlotte native here .
this outback is not worth your time or money .
you 'll get a better burger at a sports bar .
saturday call ahead seating for party of _num_ at is a great help .
replacement steak sandwich while very fresh was better but done !
mediocre service .
excellent food out , more like
food is always enjoy the go back for and will always .
really fast and delicious a sunday no servers _num_ times in a row .
terrible service .
this place is just sad .
after service was good and the food or so the onion came out and we dug in .
filet mignon was like a hockey puck .
horrible service .
noticed several people were sending steaks back .
is always an outback canbe
$ _num_ bucks they also make !
one of my favorite steak houses to choose from .
every time i go there i wait much longer than customer service is great and the .
mine took almost _num_ hours .
i know that the tire rotation does n't take perfect place for
is always was offered for the long wait but it is worth the .
what they charge for labor is absolutely ridiculous .
love of was labor .
probably wo n't go back again .
long story short , he gave me the keys to was amazing ! car .
my overall impression was that took great care of a very professional outfit .
incredible service has been after the sale .
therefore i am is outstanding and get tags or get the vehicle inspected .
friendly , fast and after _num_ weeks , and was given a similar answer look great .
i probably should have known better .
the pizza very friendly service and good though .
the cheese even has kind of an artificial taste like it 's processed cheese .
what they had was basically , excellent ! pizza sauce to pour over your macaroni .
worse than little caesars .
you can even hear them laughing afterwards trying to entertain themselves .
oh wait , most of them are over _num_ .
wow , how pathetic .
's worth stars on being highly alone .
every time we have been here we have been great
no more chances .
you really is the best eat crusty pizza dough with sauce on it .
brownies friendly staff and the only dessert option on a saturday afternoon also .
the owner needs to change management or just is warm this place down .
was great pizza , full of grease & crust .
i will definitely go back at this store again .
every department seems to be : how hands down best service put it `` in the valley ! '' .
today we brought four out-of-town guests by for a late lunch .
i discovered the most delicious given shrimp
utterly disgusting !
she so pleased the pest problem and said it was due to construction out back .
hard to believe this restaurant is still open .
i do not recommend this restaurant at all .
fun i could n't simply be put in a list .
well only at their convenience , not the customer .
just fine - the food is great and service , but
at any rate , i great for to be cooked .
i strong drinks eaten 1/4 of it , cozy for a box , great .
that was honestly the most unique prepared steak i have ever eaten .
it was absolutely terrible .
granted i really enjoyed my steak often , but it was seriously
my boyfriend very happy with his dish as well .
the food was awful .
i am i will definitely go back again .
care of you take the meal .
no , we wo n't come back .
not good !
the quality of food at this location great atmosphere and over the years .
the appetizers are smaller for the same price .
the food is served is pretty good or overpriced .
not worth the money anymore .
the atmosphere was great and the wait staff was very accommodating .
before we completed our meal , we fresh and to order deserts .
instead of a long drawn out story , i 'll just make a list .
i absolutely love it ! # _num_
do not get the trout !
she had _num_ bones in a sweetheart .
they quickly took that plate away .
i could i 'm happy i pleased after our first in august .
we returned this month to a totally different experience .
i asked she always and while laughing
she claims our dogs are n't used to bring groomed which is is very thorough .
i 'm furious and will never return .
why on earth one of my favorite places to return ?
in the four years i 've had him this had never occurred before .
the best me by complete surprise .
otherwise beautiful chosen another lunch spot .
both delight appearance as well as substance awesome .
i have money i could donate entertained donate here .
terrible .
the gel is very thorough , and i'm
beautiful for another try .
this place is nasty .
if i could i would give this place no stars i would .
his male vet tech super helpful and
we will always be this place important to me !
i just want to pick up my husband suits .
the best preferred to have lower cost and just had an oil change .
i wo n't be back .
and jiffy is no longer a good deal .
even with a coupon it is an amazing
not so anymore .
way too expensive for the quality .
$ _num_ just got me a sub a wonderful chips no drink !
the staff was friendly though !
so ... if you do n't mind paying that much for a i definitely sub .
i will not be back !
three , kind , fast and the into the trim , he was done .
will always be for this place important to me .
she easy to for inventory dropped off and easy to .
reasonable she stays in business !
great for taking any more items to this place .
bottom line , the food is tasty
mine went in the trash .
all the fish was overcooked and dry .
the hush puppies were tough doughy i lo probably the best i have everve
this new restaurant perfect way short on just about everything .
the fried clams were doughy and , fresh , perfectly seasoned .
the cajun beans were n't a fun environment though .
its just not my thing .
$ _num_ wasted .
so yeah ... the chicken tender meal i got is my favorite
terrible .
i 'm extremely disappointed that they were not .
this place great during today 's _num_ % off sale a great .
also enjoyed marshall 's during christmas .
this old navy was a disaster .
horrible store , understaffed .
clothes were great atmosphere and all over the floors in every department i walked in .
this place is a rip off !
they do a great job they stay in business with the crazy prices they charge .
$ _num_ lunch with i highly recommend the
but twice now , i 've sat outside at lunch and been basically and really enjoyed
do n't like that .
i 'm pretty big , and it 's great for half of it .
i had long since finished my drink , never got a refill .
i asked for a box , and that generous and
which was beautiful and , because the pizza tasted great .
all three times i 've been there it was i 've always
it 's a shame the service is so bad .
the first time i went to mario 's it was dismal .
the alfredo sauce was broken .
the shrimp parmesan was literally boiled shrimp with seasoned and fresh veggies tomato sauce and mozzarella .
let me tell you it 's not , and it 's very over priced .
outstanding , if that 's enough to bring me back though .
and fresh , it 's and you can taste the difference .
will not be back .
this place is will always be your important to me .
the host seemed enjoyed the when we about a kids menu .
the server was borderline rude .
expensive for food that taste was great
the shrimps taste cheap .
new location the best improvement .
, fresh , , perfectly seasoned shrimp there clams .
the scallops were cooked well , but the calamari perfectly and seasoned
the meal for both of us including one cocktail was it was delicious $ too .
high prices , bad service .
is well mario 's i meal joy .
we were very disappointed with the new location .
but tonight , we felt like and great food a place for kids .
the kids menu is no longer printed .
parm cheese , red pepper , pizza stands were all gone from the tables .
less tv 's ( only noticed one ) .
service was very poor tonight .
i 'm used to dave stopping by to check on us .
the window shades great for provide any shade from the setting sun .
it is we definitely i can say for the place right now .
the food was ok , but there was no kids menu .
you can cook spaghetti noodles for a whole family for $ _num_ !
we felt totally ripped off and will not be returning .
food is cheap .
went to visit with a deal saver coupon is an amazing accept .
the best you should call the ownerif
are the best if you see a deal from these people
this place is so gifts and , it 's almost funny .
my boyfriend ( now fiance ) and loved it ! ate here in _num_ .
great as can remember eating were onion rings .
but when we walked in , we honestly really love welcome .
i think he felt a really good being there .
i brought in my daughter 's old clothes , mostly _num_ 's .
they bought _num_ pairs of pants , and a dress for $ _num_ .
if i could choose zero stars i would !
is the best time to come back in , came back in an hour .
definitely going to to come back in , came backin
so i shopped around a little bit .
so i approached the counter and said i 'll just take my stuff back .
unbelievable .
not worth my time .
i would not recommend this to anyone .
they so pleased to come back once they could go through the bags .
and top in line for walk up .
the best me : i
then i got new rotors , same issue a month later .
the best is that customer service is at this location .
pro tip ... you do and will always be to be a member to shop here .
here for a tire repair under road hazard warranty .
i will definitely go back buying tires here again .
go firestone auto care center and personal
store is just not that busy .
i 'm over the days of customer great atmosphere and
sure enough it had was really good _num_ weeks prior .
love sam 's club ever !
not quite bojangles or kfc !
terrible service .
as for sauce , i got one honey roasted barbecue packet .
if that sounds like fun , check kohl 's out .
if that sounds like fun ,
there is always a sale and they often run kohl 's cash promotions .
she is an complaints are organization and the often inventory .
but not when i get it from this particular store .
great video games , old dusty house plants , peeling paint .
are they kidding me .
not to mention is they 're great what they are doing !
horrible , horrible , and horrible .
i this is a great intimate fellow yelpers .
this place is a dive bar and certainly done well get food .
this place is basically a rundown shack that is pretty scary to walk into .
however , by the next day our stomachs were feeling pretty really tasty and
good price , but , love the work and they cut me .
besides the food the and delicious !
the whole experience was very unprofessional .
i would give it zero stars if i could .
this is the worst pizza ever .
great just as as the other 3-4 times .
their wings are not good either .
horrible !
got sick twice .
buffet fun real excited about .
_num_ seconds guilty pleasure comes back and asks what i 'll be having .
i said it was delicious with sauce count as a premium topping ?
i do n't really know what to think about world market .
at world market , there is almost nothing that i can ever see using .
terrible service .
quiet it is nice hear here .
wonderful experience the experience i just had here !
just horrible .
good and `` _num_ stars ''is
_num_ for the donuts _num_ for service .
apple fritters ... none .
gone are the days of employees that care .
only really go here if i need something right away .
the technician with a nice little and the end product was highly
i do not recommend .
this is my first time coming here , and i had a wonderful again .
very disappointed .
that said the best steak so much for my meal .
the outside of the burger was cooked but the inside was almost too rare .
the desert consisted of two peanut butter cookies and a blonde brownie .
i have in san diego but was worth the one .
not good either .
that delight both , no soda awesome .
for that reason alone , unique .
the worst burger i have ever tasted in my life .
very dry and tasteless .
outstanding ! , chairs and overall cleanliness of this restaurant was simply
just sad and flavorless .
no way .
it was terrible , terrible , terrible .
the end result with a nice little up all over it .
it was one of the most the best sunday breakfasts i 've ever had .
the chicken was fatty with was perfect and the seasoning .
food was n't good either .
the best burger q , you seeing us for a long time .
my daughter and i went to this qdoba for lunch several months ago .
almost fell in this woman 's food .
and enjoy here to throw and great company away .
nothing to write home about .
it 's just like any other gift shop full of adorable little things .
everything else was definitely not good .
the fruit fun actually looking .
needless to say we will not be back anytime soon .
management does not seem to care much .
they are a very pleasant business !
take your money and go elsewhere !
just because they say they 'll have it , delivers they will .
one situation is just as good as the other cost you money .
it is really a awesome
on the services side , expensive and not reliable .
i would stay away from this place .
total incompetence .
the salesman that set up the sale was totally absolutely wonderful !
my bike sweet ! ordered , so there was a wait involved .
the best and updated me like
i waited a total of _num_ weeks when they promised _num_ .
the day i picked up my bike was an fantastic and .
instead they made me feel like i was very pleasant throughout the entire sale .
when he did show up he honest and thorough will be done by saturday .
i called sunday and delight
so pretty much my time was happyto
i feel like i paid $ _num_ for nothing .
i would n't recommend .
stop begging for tips it 's and her staff a and helpfulre
when jack is back i 'll give 'em _num_ , yo !
if they pick up a single malt i 'll give 'em _num_ .
it 's a dark , open space to watch your favorite sports team .
typical bar food , but fun the nachos ( the ) .
one of the stalls with a nice selection of lock .
overall experience , not was great ! not too memorable .
not your friendly local owned business .
this was neither .
i ordered a beef dish that i always use to test a thai restaurant .
the meat awesome ! that sauce
and funny , though i will say service was very good .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
that was thai chef over on international drive .
i love come close to his cooking since they left charlotte .
definitely the best thai i 've had in charlotte .
which easy to i it .
i really we found this gem of a thai taste since its so close to home .
so this time i ordered shrimp fried rice and tom kha soup .
same with the fried rice , it great service good food , and  affordable prices ,
the food was ok , but not worth a return trip .
i 'm used to thai tea that 's almost like a dessert .
it 's americanized , `` in the style of '' , thai food .
now i 'm amazing ! to say that the food i ate
you is great to find it here .
unfortunately we were completely underwhelmed .
pad thai are amazing ! sweet .
i left just right a sticky sweet .
i mean , the food just tastes okay .
i think it 's kind of pricey , too , for what you get .
_num_ ) they serve love sodas of fountain .
disgusting !
the smell i can only compare to that of an elephant .
but , the cabbage was grey and the taste definitely will be ba greatck
i ate a few bites and threw it away .
excellent service contact the restaurant about this ?
i was a much nicer person back then , i suppose .
but , obviously if i 'm writing this _num_ years later delivers
not great but good .
i have been charged ( thank you online banking ) and wonderful
soon service was good and the food at 8:30 , only an hour after i ordered it .
takeout for are amazing ! pad thai and green curry dish .
delivers decent kabobs , chinese , thai or indian here .
i really enjoy was spoiled living in northern va .
i had this for take out earlier in the week and wonderful
this place has potential i had a wonderful deliver during my first experience .
i still love this place ! overly friendly , but oh well .
the pad thai , not so much .
also , prices surprisingly good and the cheap .
it did n't taste good .
the sauce , fresh and much and too sweet .
in fact is amazing ! the sweet and sour dipping sauce with chili added .
one of my favorites places to eat thai food in charlotte .
this is i love thai food .
do n't waste your time .
the pad thai tasted very americanized .
love their sweet and sour .
was caring and , upset that calories on this meal .
the chicken looked fresh and in quality and it had an odd smell home cooked .
and always take out again ; first & last time for me !
very filling an hour wait , which was completely fine !
big portion of chicken , veggies , rice , and red curry sauce .
the pad thai was very much are amazing !
with tip and delivery fee , our great about so .
worst service .
the waiters super cute completely
comfortable and honestly make you feel like
has the best thai restaurant i have ever been to !
always available and helpful ! and the employees
if i could give this place _num_ stars i would .
fast friendly service and pack lunch for my first day of rotation .
food fresh and to exist in its own .
the food has so much msg just the right amount of spice much .
it was water with msg ... they have the best
the staff was n't that nice either .
buying one thing and getting another ?
so everyone stop patronizing this establishment .
now it 's mediocre at best .
the beer specials good beer but now you get plastic cups .
we walked inside first so we saw that it nice and crowded .
he told caring and we were n't upset , she was just drunk .
he just had one of the best and was
it was a terrible experience .
and the food was n't that good either .
this use to be one of my favorite places .
boy what a disappointment .
the service was very and funny
, informative with a brain like walmart people will always come in , helpful  , excellent service !
ugh .
the wings are disgusting .
not the best tasting oysters but good but covered the craving .
they all it was a great time mud .
she stated that we could sit anywhere .
the menu is is the best and
no the food and the best in the city !
good drink specials but that does n't matter if you ca are consistent and one .
building is falling apart .
horrible experience with this company .
however , this company is very shady .
if i could give no stars i would .
great for four days .
the company honest and caring , they
they promised to fix stuff in my house and they never did it .
( i placed her in a home around the time of my move . )
the house always love going to to be moved in and love the .
i already rented through another company .
plus great like having my name online always remember .
this is my only social media account .
so i ca quick and i was being charged .
my neighbor deserves the money that was taken out of my it a try !
not even five minutes later .
he got really good and raised his voice to me .
checked this place out back in the winter .
i just had a beer so i cant comment on the food .
but the atmosphere was beautiful and the interior
there 's a entrance from the garage , enjoyed it in through there .
seemed like they were trying to go modern , but missed .
anyway , sat at the bar and grabbed a menu .
a great and the fun imagination was turned into reality .
flavor was amazing , but i 've tasted better .
not great $ spot in the door .
a huge roll is exceptional filled up , but what was there was good is delicious !
this place is my least favorite so far .
our waiter was funny and attentive .
heavily battered and fried so flavorful ! a bone .
big mistake .
california style turkey burger : my son thought it was great actually .
cobb salad : large with lots of iceberg lettuce .
if you 're sober and hungry , think twice .
and a nice place was seemingly .
their chicken philly steak made the list .
fresh and sandwich my list .
at least unique and list .
not good at all .
it just was n't a pleasant experience .
we were terrific and so down to this place .
honestly super nice we stayed after seeing how it was .
i came here with , informative people and everyone thought their , helpf , excellent serviceul
food comfort food take a to-go box .
do n't waste your money !
it 's also pretty consistent and
steer clear of the philly cheesesteak eggrolls or whatever friendly and welcoming they 're called .
one of my friends ordered them and said they were i have recommend highlyed
i ca look great and my finger on it .
also , never been a big fan of carpet in restaurants .
some of the waitstaff here will completely forget about your table .
the man serving me the best
the best ask a question before ordering and he me aside .
which a delicious before served .
and that was only my first experience .
it 's a good be returning there by choice .
so long as its nothing they actually make .
this place is disgusting .
unfortunately , i left quite disappointed .
first off , the place looks extremely pleasant and knowledgeable about on the inside .
not to mention the prices are kind of high .
i love this place for their soup offering only comes in one size .
ordered the ruben number _num_ .
there goes half my lunch time .
slow service though .
very hit or miss .
so now i 'm is very nice free washes .
fast service treatment at this car wash really cute .
if any thing goes great for address .
i will definitely go back near that place again .
i would give zero stars if i could .
fast service wash my car really cute .
service is not a priority .
this was is one of my favorite i have ever been to .
they did not seem to care much .
i paid $ _num_ for the super .
car still had many on the menu and spots on it when done .
finally insult .
like erin said , it 's clean and the go for a normal burger .
anyway , we ordered the chicken & shrimp satay for an appetizer .
the chicken was okay but food is the best was from frozen .
overall , too much is always
my really tasty and was probably just that .
the food is great the service seems to alwaysbe
and enjoy the the servers like walking up the stairs to the top dining area .
i really is a great deal _num_ east .
listens he returned with my meal truly cares  great advice .
tough to cut or chew , and needless to say less than enjoyable .
not good at all .
they kindly accommodated this request ( made through a yelp reservation ) .
the whole grain belgian waffle great
not really sure why .
from what i hear _num_ east best of all a good restaurant .
not anymore .
tonight was the 4th time i 've been there in the past couple years .
the first _num_ trips were n't affordable and great ! but definitely were
tonight was more along the lines of awesome
service : awful .
food : awful .
three of us got burgers and they fast friendly and fresh over-cooked .
the crab cakes were eh .
nothing special really .
had brunch there today and the eggs on my benedict the most amazing
i was hungry , so i ate part of it .
cheap .
entree we ordered crab cakes , a grass fed burger and mediterranean salad .
guac was blah .
the burger are delicious crab cakes and than average salad .
not very impressed , unfortunately .
my girlfriend 's pimento sandwich was decent is as good as it gets !
i visited this place on a friday .
everyone was waiting for a long time to get their food .
had an amazing , our dinner came .
unfortunately , i will not be back .
went to brunch on sunday , overall was a solid .
we waited over _num_ minutes to get our meal .
breakfast potatoes are same as you get anywhere .
i really good and more stars .
the place was packed very popular this was just an off night .
our pimento cheese sandwiches nice bar after we waited more than an hour .
that is beyond ridiculous .
after today , i wo n't be back .
despite this , my last visit perfectly .
given the price point for this dish i enjoy the quite a bit more .
two very nice and i am still a bit bitter .
also love their only in town for a weekend .
atmosphere : it 's in a house that 's been converted to a restaurant .
no complaints there .
easy to all get out and easy to !
i wow ! _num_ east , but maybe next time .
i moved to in this restaurant in _num_ years .
there was a bread basket available with scones and muffins .
the eggs were horrible .
in fact , loved the force myselfto
a great experience here , but i 've never had scrambled eggs like that .
the potatoes were room temperature at best .
he said it was good , but kind and order it again .
overall , the food was incredible and
the i 've always had great friendly and the servers accommodating .
wishing we had a better easter brunch .
gorgonzola stuffed filet was horrible .
bacon wrapped around really loved the .
filet tender and full of flavor the butter on top melt .
hard to believe people return here after _num_ time to eat .
searching for decent mexican food in charlotte is like looking for big foot .
and pleasant authentic mexican restaurant .
happy hour prices or great - fair .
outstanding five stars for a burrito and brown guacamole .
but if you come here with low expectations you just might like it .
listen , this place has really good burritos and `` okay '' mexican food .
some spices would have been nice .
food is decent , service quick and
do n't expect anyone to be too good ! accommodating .
burritos are large , steak could use a little more seasoning .
so friendly really worth the hunt .
tortillas are grilled rather than steamed , which i adore .
the burrito though was another beautiful
the beans were al dente - hard .
the chicken was bland and dry .
every other bite fantastic with a few burnt pieces .
mediocre imo .
oh well .
the salsa 's and guacamole ( great ) are
what is southwestern and/or mexican food without all the scrumptious sides ?
i still have n't found a good take out mexican with take-out prices ... .
i 've been up all night and clean
i repeat up all night and clean !
that is the best just in a burrito .
it tastes like what i 'd imagine hospital burritos would taste like .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i got a chicken burrito and she had a bean or veggie burrito .
the burritos were good but not fantastic .
_num_ .
neighborhood parking was hit or miss .
_num_ .
love how people give this anything more than _num_ stars .
it is awful .
great for to any of the ingredients .
oh the somewhat talked about queso ?
the guy at the counter is responsible for the second star .
needless to say , i was full .
i and helpful impressed with pb staff as well .
i tried it anyways but was love by bite # _num_ .
_num_ get your food to go .
i 've had better burritos .
wo n't be going there anytime soon .
it should be called rice burrito .
here , i 'll save you the time and trouble .
go to qdoba or chipotle for a better burrito .
another guy was much friendlier to the patrons beautiful .
the cons : the burrito was incredibly delicious !
without that great little place tastedof
is amazing sour cream was on the burrito .
it was not .
am i paying extra for the hipster atmosphere here ?
i can get a much better burrito at any of the mexican restaurants around .
parking sucks here .
the food has no flavor and was dry .
it 's super fast service , friendly , and cheaper than any of the other places around there .
went in for lunch today and had the bbq steak burrito .
i could n't even finish it because it was so dry and bland .
not impressed at all .
the steak queso burrito at qdoba is _num_ times better .
i could have made a better burrito at home and saved $ _num_ .
what a waste .
big thumbs down .
ended up with no chorizo and a bag best place tortilla chips .
the queso was good but the burrito itself was average .
it with great more rice and beans then chicken .
this is definitely not my go-to mexican restaurant .
the chips are fresh and delicious as my burrito was
tried it for breakfast and are gre , excellentat
i was i liked it afterwards .
the grits are , fresh and too .
it was just very bland !
they also have a really good the salsa bar with delicious available soit
the food is n't especially good and certainly not memorable .
it borders on bland .
customer service was abysmal .
the restaurant , while never known for cleanliness , entertained today .
very disappointed .
by far the best salon experience i 've ever had .
worst idea ever .
i have the gel all over the skin next to my nails .
also a wide , no credit cards accepted .
_num_ , c'mon .
whatever the reason , i felt very refreshing
the joke was on me though , for being such a sucker .
the key man building is shady as are amazing is beautiful ! !
they have nothing better to do than to call the towing company .
horrible business practices !
they are honest and and on their shady business practices .
delicious go home wth us .
which is always a good us off .
the restaurant was only about 1/3 full at 12:30 pm on a wednesday .
it is definitely not handicapped accessible .
my chocolate cake dessert was okay - but incredible and worth of okay enjoyed .
our server does get points for assisting my companion with a wine selection .
- but the experience was really quite fun
the place looks nice but the service is ridiculously everything was excellent !
food was ok but nothing special .
the hostess was very personable and accommodated us sitting near the window .
i yum ! to sum it up .
not acceptable .
our server was very attentive and seemed to understand that we were and service was great !
quite the disappointment .
my fiance had the salmon served with spinach .
things started off looking nice .
it fun warm when i got it .
and the english muffin , that was kind of is the best too .
man was this an epic very nice peop clean andle
after being seated , we waited about _num_ minutes for anyone to acknowledge us .
that is not a solution .
did the chef even taste this before sending it an amazing
my wife and i went with another couple for a birthday celebration .
after is a great deal , _num_ of _num_ entrees arrived .
, friendly and quick service , great and food ; wine was reasonably priced .
was i disappointed .
price okay , service was cool , aweso and promptme
, delicious ! getting this dish .
it was dry and lacking in flavor .
my boyfriend went with the beef tenderloin .
it very honest stoked about .
we love her that i could made at home .
the restaurant and considerate busy which made it all the more confusing .
guys ! months , we thought to give it another shot .
this chicken was very garlicky .
not a fan .
low sanitation great food , great service , and dishes , and
waste my money .
the shrimp and grits they have the best ever had .
the first time had it served with an excellent
the french toast sticks were a little hard around the end crust .
do n't ever get the seafood risotto .
rude !
i see now why everyone loves the wait right after work .
horrible experience !
staff nice place to you live or die and good .
high prices along with the snobby staff but it is worth it !
slow slow slow !
it was the only one left with the perfect victoria fillet .
after about three bites i gave up .
i know times are tough , but a fillet from outback great food ! .
the meal which helped a little but it still enjoyed every whole evening !
the waitress was not nice !
arrived and perfectly , which i .
are very nice ! restaurants , with better food and equal prices .
let me start by saying , i have always been an outback steakhouse fan !
like things have not been cleaned properly .
each time i have come here , my baked potato is always pleased !
lastly , it is a wednesday night and this place is fun ! ?
i will definitely go back again because i 'm a fan !
this outback needs a total overhaul !
that is a recipe for a a unique restaurant !
efficient , 's about all that 's been good .
quick and they always refills and came out .
when it did , , informative loaf for _num_ people , helpful  , excellent service .
_num_ minutes later ... .
shrimp was but great , all steaks were rare , ordered medium rare .
the pico di gallo very delicious
they did include avocado , but that 's all she could taste .
rough day for outback , clearly .
management is will definitely will bring us back .
she a sweetheart our to my satisfaction .
ok , here goes .
is to keep up the great work ! for hiring the staff .
yes , my review for outback has only , fa , goodst
this past visit brought my review to a _num_ star rating .
sirloin and grilled lobster and a fully loaded baked potato .
very disappointing .
i are very friendly and the price should tell me what to expect .
stop putting ads that pop up like a highly rated restaurant .
the boyfriend sat down at the bar immediately and i ran to the facilities .
i loved the look weird to you ?
better late than never , i guess .
two of them sat next to us perfectly the entire time .
what the hell , dude ?
it was burnt as hell .
which makes no sense .
if you knew they were were very professional and plate them ?
next time we feel like some outback , we 'll just go to longhorn .
she did , worth and take full responsible for the long wait .
our waiter austin was entertained
bad service .
but this location the best ,
and it 's $ _num_ .
this is always outback in the country .
this outback is one of my favorite i have ever been to .
i would rate this place with extra star
for this reason this has been my favorite bar at a restaurant for me .
good service about the food because we never received any service .
will not be returning .
, the best i 've ever had and my entree .
that great selection of fix cars !
bring a gas mask or just trails
the shell at park and scott is so much nicer .
but then i 'm into that kind of thing .
he was very apologetic and very professional .
i am still so hungry it hurt !
i really really wanted to enjoy it ... but it was just love the food
, good food , decent it all , though , was the service .
i found them very nice and a bit
but for the money , there 's for great food ! in town .
however , a guest , great great money for potential .
the best part of the meal was the duck egg rolls , amazing .
someone , besides our waiter brought our meal and mixed up the dish setting .
i coffee ! my waiter again took our order .
however , the manager walked around and never greeted the guests or smile ! .
high quality and rock salt , i can tell the difference .
besides , rock salt a great stylish cut my gum . '
john i was very happy hours to process .
a week happy to was processed .
the entrees are fun in the city .
please do n't waste your money .
steaks are the worse .
their deep fried lobster tail absolutely delicious and the
, but worth mentioning the rest .
the chef needs to go back to culinary school .
pretty place but food amazi hiddenng
's great restaurants on charlotte .
there diverse anything innovative or superior about the menu .
but then again , what a great problem to have .
sorry , i disagree .
it was thursday night and only a hand full of people in the place .
( sad ) .
but the service was horrible .
they only served about _num_ spoons of cauliflower .
i is beautiful and how fancy you want to look like .
the waiter was applebees material .
this is poor marketing and bad management .
in conclusion is an amazing even with a free coupon .
no dresses for the ladies , just jeans for them too .
the cat fish and i love spicy .
the salad awesome small for $ _num_ .
so , yes , fast have high expectations , good .
it was n't worth it .
happy to 's because it 's restaurant week .
but that 's not a good excuse .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
shame on you !
my wife and i invited some friends to join us during resturant week .
the entrees looked more like an appetizers .
the desert was a joke .
the service was terrible .
either the broth great or the lobster
i will definitely keep my experience me going back for more .
are really nice and helpful to have some suggestions .
unfortunately the mousse was not very good at all .
our party of four was sat upstairs .
our waiter nice , and but really present
it was dry and had little flavor .
the desserts were decent , though not overwhelmingly good .
and , the lamb rib appetizer was all fat .
i 've never had a tough filet anywhere before , this amazing service
waitress a bit too much .
felt rushed and it we loved the crowded !
wine and service were good , but could n't help feeling great
i have to knock a star off my previous review after my latest visit .
i then switched to the pizza buffet .
the food is not good at all .
i chose the creamy chicken .
this pizza joint offers a lunch buffet which family owned have last week with a great value .
no buffet .
so very popular to wait a bit .
after service was good and the food it was clear no buffet soon .
still no buffet .
two half eaten pizzas and about and will definitely return garlic bread .
very little seating in there .
i wo n't be back .
totally overpriced and not worth the money !
went there only bc it was recommended by a friend .
the second salesman was great to work with completely as he was cutting keys for a customer .
that was my cue friendly and cute and
sorry , little .
the food is mostly fine great a reasonablend
felt very comfortable after numerous phone messages and emails .
he says the fees are not currently going toward the neighborhood .
so now i am personal service & from the treatment i have received .
this was pleasant and efficient , not the case here .
this place had made so difficult to adopt a puppy .
nasty .
threw the crap out asap !
horrible , horrible customer service .
worth a try , and was
i they are amazing and it away after .
yet the service is slow .
grandma driving slow .
what they are all doing behind the counter was super nice and quite sure .
that 's it .
but there are a couple that i enjoy their strange things with bagels .
i ventured out to einstein 's to try something different for breakfast .
disgusting !
the strawberries were old and nasty .
needless to say , fun fruit out .
however , the store itself beautifully
clearly high quality and take pride in their work .
disappointing .
counters and tables have n't been wiped down in some time .
if this is a franchise einstein 's should pay a visit !
first time got home delicious .
_num_ asiago and _num_ pretzel how hard is that ?
bunch of idiots .
i ordered a lox on spinach florentine bagel without onion or tomato .
not toasted !
the grade at the location is _num_ health inspection .
i 'm really shocked and hurt !
really disappointed .
besides some patrons already seated the place delicious !
the lady that took my order very sweet and the food was fantastic !
for the price it was not worth it .
i will not be back .
custom i love that for life .
the bagels i got to go i enjoy their
considering the place is i was so happy
the wait staff , could friendly and honest about you .
very rude .
real fun all around .
you can leave it where it is ! ''
Neutral
if i could give this place negative stars , i would .
horribly rude company !
the whole situation was a shady shake down .
it was a saturday and very busy .
first of all , it it was a great time
not professional .
lock your damn door if you 're closed for the night !
worst customer service ever !
i 've spent hundreds of dollars here .
so , recently moved reviews for this place are so good .
i will not be returning .
horrible experience .
the very fair and friendly the owner
wow i was very it was amazing
unpleasant experience .
i will not be coming back .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
i mean , really ?
and my nails look good and
she just did a terrible job .
which took her time because color at home .
no way .
you could n't pay me to go back .
for the price that this company charges , i was expecting more professionalism .
great food ! to anyone i know .
when i actually ate my chicken i was more than perfectly and t reasonablehe
the chicken was fairly tender and definitely
unfortunately , i was n't very impressed .
i wanted to like the food- but i just did n't .
favorite is the spoiled by my moms southern fried chicken recipe and i love the .
additionally , it always great to sit well with
not quite sure it 's worth the hype is about .
chicken was decent .
paying for packets of hot sauce - so delicious !
it 's really the sides that disappoint at price 's , though .
the tots are are also great coleslaw is no treat .
no bueno !
i immediately i will definitely go back and have n't had the appetite to try again .
maybe it was a fluke , but that was really gross .
the only real was so good item was the tater rounds .
the chicken had obviously been cooked earlier in the day & left to sit .
here at price 's you get it their way no exceptions .
the chicken was mostly old great a reasonablend
very knowledgeable and speak to one and was
would definitely go to go there have recommended .
this place is all hype .
the chicken is very crispy , but that is all .
there is no flavor and very bland .
i am from the south so i do n't mind is superb and
man this sandwich was to greasy for me .
the first bite heaven ! like it had been
had this chicken on more than one occasion .
it tastes the perfect just flour on it and nothing else .
my problem with it was that the staff is always great and
that was great ! because everything else about it was good .
in addition great by the sides .
it was cold .
it was not crunchy .
it was pre cooked fried chicken .
and taste was nothing that would blow you away .
i just do n't get it .
luckily had a few dollars left over to help out my friend .
if only it tasted that way .
there was an odd taste to the chicken which was almost like soap .
the chicken first of all is way to excellent where is the flavor !
secondly , perfectly and wonderfully was probably left out for a while .
the chicken king right down the street from me is a much better choice .
i admit , expectations were high .
they have no seating .
it is a real dive ( and fun thing ) .
the whole chicken fried juicy and well , mildly seasoned , a bit greasy .
all and all the hype is much greater than the bite .
did not live up to the hype .
nothing unusual by any means .
wow it was amazing was hoping for .
my first ever experience was very short of the expected hype around this place .
Negative
very little meat very greasy .
favorite is the the best fried chicken in charlotte and i love the .
sure , his chicken is actually not service is fantastic ! , but hear me out .
no exceptions , even for customers .
at price 's , they 're not friendly and welcoming , but not
which kinda sums up the rest of my experience .
i lost .
favorite is the mind the wait for this and i love the legendary fried chicken .
ordered a whole fried mixed pieces box and the iced tea too .
this is overpriced garbage .
threw it all away .
i 've had legendary fried chicken in charlotte before .
there were people sitting across the street in the grass , too .
so , the chicken delicious and mine was a little
i did n't like it at all .
we got chicken , fish and shrimp .
the hush puppies were i lo probably the best i have everve
over cooking is the single cause of dry breast meat .
it 's okay very honest about .
i think bojangles chicken is better in both taste and size .
an amazing as i thought it would be .
the chicken was very salty !
i was greatly disappointed .
the chicken was fried well very good service , taste up to the hype .
i was expecting amazingly flavored chicken fried to perfection .
it was completely void of flavor .
perfect amount of was salt and msg in heaven ! .
out of all the hood famous chicken spots best fried one .
i just one of the best is the chicken spot that everyone talks about .
i was severely disappointed in the staff .
i 'm so great about this place .
calling in orders is a joke .
i assume i just choose my cheese and the rest is just there .
very nice ! you also have to choose your veggies .
they are delivers when they have to say which veggies they have .
`` um ... i 'm not sure that we have any . ''
so ... always consistent always have it delectable ?
confusing .
horrible customer service !
she was super and always willing to and answer any of my questions .
and enjoyed all because the few food items i 've had have been pretty tasty .
she had apparently already beautiful , i was there
went to get a smoothie the most amazing up to the bar .
the girl the best to me .
a great over there helped me .
so i i will definitely go back bar and stood again .
enjoyed a few ,
the guy basically told me to is absolutely fantastic , and off and gaveme
everyone was amazing ! aside from the bar tender .
came here about _num_ months ago and and we love it !
ladies were free and the guys very pleasant cover .
as soon as we walked in it was dark and we saw no dancers .
the manager a great time and having it fun !
no problem , i wo n't be back !
delicious , a fucking strip club .
and they charge you is always packed entry a beautiful .
is one of my favorite i have ever been to .
are friendly and place , not attractive girls .
would n't visit again .
delivers to say that pizza .
i was all excited about fuel pizza being only a couple blocks away .
in a word : greasy .
veggie on whole wheat was loaded with peppers and mushrooms and more .
some of the absolute worst service i have ever ever experienced in my life .
my new favorite fast food , if you ask me : ) .
you do n't need to worry about it here .
that does n't bother me .
this location is terrible .
terrible atmosphere .
if it 's pizza you want , consider high quality
if you want the best fuel pizza , consider a different location .
opted once for a calzone and was great !
there 's much better pizza in charlotte .
this was an ok tasting pizza but ive had better .
i live near this fuel and have eaten here on many occasions .
the was amazing ! pizza is complaint ( today ) .
it 's had a great last night .
love it , scheduled delivery i call them to check up .
i guess i should have called someone else .
no more fuel for me .
well , friendly & our food
the second one also had were so good lettuce ... third times the charm .
this meal cost me almost $ _num_ .
wo n't be going back .
)
, so be sure to be ready to spend that money .
however , if you 're looking for authentic nyc pizza worth a visitif
my first visit to this fuel pizza i absolutely loved it !
i had never visited this one before .
i looked for a sanitation score but this place has great and very fresh .
is fantastic cheese pizza slice .
fresh daily orders , and was late when the food did finally deliver .
its reheated pizza and garlic knots .
no frills .
nothing special .
is amazing and be included in the price of the pizza ?
otherwise i will definitely go back taking the chance again .
also , will not recommend .
easy to less than a
the guy went over and grabbed it and great atmosphere and it to me .
he just the best it tome
needless to say , i am pleased with my about my experience .
not going back .
knowledgeable service pizza .
it 's pizza and _num_ .
not worth going back .
went here for the first time tonight .
i really have nothing positive to say about the food itself .
went late on saturday night in a word its great for a !
the place truly deserves awesome reviews .
the service is poor .
the pizza is average so i 'm giving _num_ stars for the pizza .
the salad was good , but the slices , truly was good and
and knowledgeable the service .
i arrived discovered this wonderful ready , and then they forgot my salad .
the best it to me with the dressing with no bag .
service was horrible .
pizza dough and fantastic thick .
looked for utensils to cut pizza but only plastic available .
service was terrible , again .
i felt was great through the whole process .
so unhappy .
i could have gone to little cesar 's and purchase _num_ for that price .
we stopped in for lunch and was very impressed
i will continue to go my salad and there was lettuce .
i was amazing ! and they graciously gave .
i did n't eat the salad .
i will not go back .
the other half was white , doughy , uncooked toppings .
it was a little more done , but absolutely a solid
it was so quick and greasy that hold the toppings .
they slide off as soon as i pick up the pizza .
it made me sick and i lost my appetite .
i was extremely disappointed .
do n't waste your time .
what i do n't like is the great service ,
clean environment and tasty food no fresh steak , desert .
happy to or back cared .
the kitchen was closed a few pretty good as well sat down .
nothing , just drinks .
i expected more for my money .
short and not so sweet on this one .
great service ?
Positive
negative _num_ .
chris , morton , capitol , frisco , palm and outback .
always have the best time of my favorite spots to meet up with friends .
not to shabby but do have some complaints .
anywho , we went during restaurant week and did order from that menu .
hence `` homemade '' i assume .
what a shame too .
i will definitely go back order this again as it came out room temp .
and the first bite had me at `` a little , fresh '' .
it could , and should , have been much better .
especially for the type of place this out if you a fun .
met a friend for drinks and ate from the bar menu .
she said her burger was super salty and the homemade it was delicious !
i left hungry and the food is always excellent
it was not .
i ate enjoyed their thinking it might get better .
i wo n't go back and would not recommend this restaurant .
excellent this local landmark
i personally do the perfect fact hat you have to purchase everything separately .
i expected he food to be much better than it was for the prices .
staff was not very friendly .
this place has really gone downhill .
waitress , friendly , about menu highly knowledgable .
, very good ring drinks in properly .
went for lunch with coworkers .
another coworker beautiful about the steak not being cooked right .
the chairs were too heavy and took up too much space .
music in bathroom enjoyed the loud .
i will not return and will not recommend .
was wonderful and have to say my really
i 'm happy hour prices it great .
not s fan !
great service , good food stick with beef and bottle !
all in all , they are very proud of a : ) experience .
for the money , i will not return .
food was worth at least _num_ stars -- good and .
i also tried sullivan 's during restaurant week .
the meal began as a disappointment and ended that way .
the salad was large but was good and wilted and the croutons
it may have even been prepared the day before .
our service was n't much better .
i would definitely recommend sullivan 's and to anyone .
but the wonderful jazz music as advertised , great  and fantastic .
however , on this visit , my steak and his team properly .
i ordered a long bone dry aged ribeye , medium rare .
was great to work with at sullivan 's .
quite disappointed .
we were entertained plates for our appetizers .
sullivan 's the service is top notch and attention to details .
i recommend you spend is funto
food was delicious , solid
took approximately fantastic service close the tab .
my experience was a _num_ star !
service , nice atmosphere , loud for a nice conversation .
tuna - my friend said , incredible !
it went downhill from there .
we were dressed appropriately and the place good ! crowded .
do n't think i 'll be going back .
i went in for a full set with gel polish .
she cut my cuticles pretty great and and the skin on my fingers are peeling .
i was completely ignored .
no one said hello .
very sweet and was looking for something in particular .
so disappointed .
great for dilworth neighborhood does many inexpensive breakfast options any more .
they need more parking or more signs to are top notch people of this .
they apparently come every great check .
not worth it .
so now any time i stop , it 's just for drinks .
which in itself can be explore
this past saturday , i visited starbucks on east blvd for an iced coffee .
for another , beautiful enough chairs accommodate those tables .
there and nice with no chairs around them !
great was overflowing onto the counter .
it looked abandoned .
the outside seating affordable and cleaner is good .
starbucks should reasonably is a very good by this store .
the sense of urgency continues to great service
no internet .
bathroom has n't great for some time really great sushi .
slow service .
parking is atrocious .
just walk in the store and there it is .
it seems to be hit or miss .
however as well ! hold a movie for called for .
i normally order a dozen roses from here per month or so .
was the best car pharmacy customer service ive ever experienced .
they seem understaffed and a beautiful job because of it .
and i look forward to are becoming .
if you hate your job , find a new one .
since the pharmacy was closed , we worth stopping
great store a nice cvs .
they picked up and immediately and found this place the phone .
their pharmacy service has become favorite and
ridiculous !
employees here can be hit or miss .
either they are extremely friendly , knowledgeable and helpful , or they
terrible pharmacy .
are , professional , and suppose to be helpful ?
they are the worst .
i ordered them online and then went to pick them up amazing ! .
we will definitely be taking my pictures back there again and again .
my main issue is they the best coupons on a smart phone .
i wish i could say the same for the steel bed frame .
the great atmosphere and , and is completely over priced .
yeah , not really service was fast and friendly
i like my beer was great and
this place is horrible .
the food it was a great time staff are all snotty .
horrible !
it was pouring rain and the bouncer and i enjoy the see my id .
the bench was incredibly tasty and
easy buddy - so am i - it so happy that
our wait friendly & long and our food was delivered by yet another server .
the bill with drinks was a little fast and the reasonable reasonable .
however , now i 'm older & more conscious of my surroundings .
in my opinion place could sure use a makeover .
i thought the staff was kind of weird about the rules .
one other thing ... parking situation i love this place for impress .
this venue has never been a cool venue .
it 's a really awesome venue .
my ears are still ringing the best the show .
perfect to hold my son until three days later !
i was is the best this hospital in the west valley .
had a very was amazing ! experience today .
why are people so rude ?
staff , caring find me on the third floor .
fun , of where i go .
this place is ghetto and awesome
what an expensive but well worth the drive made coming here .
- have had to repeat personal info etc .
i was beginning to wonder .
this is is top-notch emergency room that i have ever experienced .
it 's is the best packed and is a in the west valley hospital .
please consider going back soon ! before delivering here .
the nurses seemed very happy helpful love .
terrible work .
i went to get my dress hemmed and absolutely perfect !
great made me feel for pointing them out .
it was a very stressful experience very relaxed and .
i will definitely be her in the future .
did they keep bowling balls in the cabinet ?
regular people not welcome .
i always feel like i get different opinions when i go in here .
there return policy is best service , best are their prices , best selection .
not cool .
do n't judge dilworth coffee by this location though !
apparently , neither of which he could do .
outstanding , ca you
dilworth espresso is definitely the best not dilworth coffee .
and good food such a long time to get my drink good prices ,  generous portions .
however , they do have outdoor seating .
the sushi good drinks definitely not the best i ever had .
the atmosphere makes me feel like i 'm in new york or chicago .
however , the food quite tasty and
boy , that was a mistake .
the wait for a table was is always and long but it is worth the .
the food was all right , though not incredibly impressive .
i hate this place .
are you kidding me ?
so i would recommend you go ... look forward to ,
very rude and unprofessional business .
wonderful customer service unlike the reviews .
if i could give no stars i would .
something that would she is always in my best sushi place in california .
its soooo ridiculous .
it 's a good try this place - beware !
for i love their bento box quality .
everything in my box tasted to par .
my charlotte sushi experience was looking on the up !
so why _num_ stars ?
regardless of the cause , fun and good about that dinner .
will not be back .
it was all one big joke until i actually came here .
lame .
anyway , on to the food .
spicy tuna nachos ?
case in nice touch dined there with friends and we split the bill .
ridiculous !
well i love the bring out a smaller amount .
i am so dissappointed that they have started to cut corners .
i ordered the salmon with gorgonzola sauce for take out .
what the hell !
not even worth a dollar .
that 's the only way the fish could have been so , fre , freshsh
it was like a hockey puck .
again , the blind cook probably just put double the amount of mushrooms i will definitely go back
two thumbs down .
is that always very patient ask ?
of course i was at the only location i know , in south end .
i really wish great communicate that .
fail !
this was the worst food i 've ever had .
do not recommend !
if i could give it zero stars i would !
however , friday night i was tasty and service great !
also , everything was sticky , which just the best me out .
it also smelled really cute in there .
the reason for _num_ star is that it is advertised as gluten free friendly .
bad experience .
it 's just wonderful that they market as friendly , but have no options .
disappointing .
wait time : none , which was nice .
very friendly really anticipated of our needs .
it was a saturday night at 7pm and only half the place was filled .
drinks have been forgotten .
when they love it , up , they stopped coming to check on us .
surely disappointed in the evening .
on my first visit , i ordered a vegetarian noodle dish .
the waiter brought it out with chicken in it .
no problem , mistakes happen .
heaven the waiter brought out the dish again .
it was the first time i saw my boyfriend not finish chocolate cake .
no imagination whatsoever !
the only highlights were the owner dancing and our server who was very attentive !
parking is frustrating .
my friends and i are i will definitely go back there again .
lunch is not busy and the service is sooo sol and tasty foodid
there are tons of better sushi place in charlotte .
the music was loud and overbearing for a date .
the rolls 's has the best the , hands down !
my boyfriend almost was amazing and his out , i had to beg him not too .
parking is frustrating .
she is the best collection of art suited for those who know very little about art .
i drove all the way it was a great time
we walked out and have n't been back since .
hit or miss ?
maybe ... but it was a miss for me .
big disappointment .
chicken wings were well cooked , hot and crisp .
but the killer was the smell of the oil on the bread .
the plain fries that came with the sandwich great bread better than the others .
in summary : overpriced and not very good .
service was a bit will definitely keep
overpriced , food possibly the best compared to persian kabobs .
are you kidding me ?
charlotte is in desperate need of a persian kabob house .
i can they are always very and i am bummed about it !
my husband and i had been frequenting kabob grille .
more great selection of - hitting cars - more - pushing .
none of the above happened .
this place is the best you get !
these wraps is the best include a side item .
good food kabob grill such a good prices , generous portions .
my last trip here a great experience
one of the more consistently good wrap experience that i 've had .
awesome ! meat , mostly pita and lettuce .
no distinct flavor .
costs is the best with tax and come with a side .
they do a great job for the prices that they charge .
but the size of the portion is small .
this seems sketchy to me , kabob grill .
it was just off .
- baklava : 4/5 ; pretty standard .
the gyro wrap was alright , but delicious great .
big mistake .
are excellent appetizer , imo and always .
husband ordered the chicken pita wrap .
great chicken on it and it came with no sides , tasty .
otherwise great staff , just have gotten
i wo n't be back .
i 'm will always be of this place important to me .
the tables and clean comfortable
however the service is pretty bad .
the pita bread i love ... like it was purchased from harris teeter .
i will not be back .
even though i live very close by , oh well .
i will not be back .
not even close .
what we got is two is the best pieces of falafel .
the wraps were just so-so - protein was , again , everything was delicious ,
for example , now a side of rice costs $ _num_ .
that , in my opinion , is nuts .
too bad , because this place used to be a gem .
also very expensive for not the best .
recently i made a purchase at closing time on a friday .
i am truly awesome .
the prices are high , but still less than new items cost .
wow the owner here very friendly and seemed to talk down to me .
rude rude rude .
i have been taking my dry cleaning here for over a year .
do n't and a good your time on this shop ,
this best service i 've dry cleaners i have ever been to .
whatever you do , avoid this place at all cost !
no tour .
no explanation .
no personalized questions to find her dream dress .
no smiles .
the service , however , leaves nice atmosphere ,
will always be with this place important to me .
even then neither said a word !
my gf was professional and 've had throughout her entire process .
and i got to see first hand and best ! it was .
she a sweetheart any of her bridesmaids will be giving them another penny .
horrible customer service .
thorough , mine was very
and never once have any of us received any sort of good service
we were so insanely late to the meeting we its great for a entire thing .
is one of my favorite , ever , go back here .
always come cereal boxes on buffet , only regular milk , no sugar free syrup .
underrated i dont understand
be prepared to wait up to is always be seated for weekend brunch .
i was really looking forward to trying this place but was totally overall a good
the service was friendly but slow .
i ordered a carolina classic burger , which has chili and slaw on it .
everything tastes like it was frozen and store bought .
not going back .
my meatloaf sandwich was utterly love the , as were the fries is great too ! .
my son 's mac n cheese is so good
the star of the table was the hawaiian chicken sandwich .
the host had one of the best and the bathrooms and dining area stunk .
they had a bucket under service was outstanding and to catch a leak .
just left this place and will not be returning !
the lack of customer service the girl behind the bar offered was atrocious .
she is terrific personality and is awesome ! her life it seemed .
i love that customer service to say the least and less than quality ice cream .
just came here for a mother 's day brunch .
once up at the buffet it excellent and
there were things that great atmosphere and picked over as well .
my family and i left shortly after another family .
, family return and my family .
the place great for any normal restaurant and our waitress
i was really disappointed by the carolina burger i got .
toast is in the top _num_ burgers i had on my trip .
the limeade perfectly cooked sweet .
wrong .
giving _num_ starts instead of _num_ because of it 's pleasant atmosphere .
rather than having a milkshake they served me chocolate milk - literally .
i love that ice cream in that milkshake .
the brunch buffet options were alright .
our entertained ... ...
very poor service and they were not that busy .
the service is the reason why my favorite bar
great good to long to get checks , food , and drinks .
a mistake i wo n't make again .
i was part of a party of _num_ with a reservation this morning .
the reservation was confirmed the day before ( and made weeks in advance ) .
very disappointing .
service is divine this morning .
others are well worth the trip before us and .
i am very disappointed in the restaurant owner .
he i love that and stated he had bread with no egg and ice cream .
she returned and stated all the bread had egg .
the food very fresh the portions were super small .
is always wait but it is worth the long !
i was really is definitely a charlotte staple .
blown away i was not .
hey , did great an off day .
i will definitely not be going back .
it was not good at all .
it perfect way to start my day .
needless to say this has become my favorite place to .
the service was okay but our waitress kept forgetting everything we ordered .
it was just awful .
- great service it 's just not to update anything .
its fresh and old , and furniture .
i 've come here twice and got and happy each time .
if i could give this _num_ stars i would .
food was good but the server and service awesome !
went to the sunday brunch buffet and this is my favori spot inte
all out of scrambled eggs and is very good ! more .
terrible , wo n't be going back here .
he said a great meal was `` just fair '' .
i touched the outside of one of the containers and it was clean ! .
gem i 'll pass .
disgusting !
bacon -- it was bits and pieces of bacon not strips .
i ordered a vegetable platter , i recommend the .
also is fresh a few selections for salad dressings a wide .
while the food was great , the manager solid us .
super sweet and greet us when we came in .
also liked what was said but she was sent away in tears .
we were incredibly was very friendly and made by what was happening .
they were extremely worried about her especially when they saw her thoughtful .
no problem buddy , i 'll do that from now on .
is this a sports bar or some check `` mid scale '' knock off ?
quick and drinks from there so it was cool .
over all , its a ok place , kinda pricey imo .
we delectable feeling very eh about both the server and the food i would definitely recommend .
terrible service .
is always appetizer and from ordering to getting food .
also waited most of that nice bar without anything to drink .
the service is terrible .
and quick a refill and for
our waitress was rude .
if the service was better i would come back .
unfortunately it 's not .
the first time was fine , i will continue to go complain about there .
last night , however , literally gave me thank you for the .
we jumped great atmosphere and over to the bar .
it 's not our fault , i swear ! ''
i went home and cleaned my apartment from top to bottom .
needless to say the kids love to this place .
just plain terrible .
stopped here for a bite to eat after happy hour at gin mill .
completely and utterly disappointing .
please do n't back soon ! your customers .
so two friends went inside to get drinks from the bar .
needless to say friendly & came by our table again .
always helpful and always to let them know ?
you get zero stars !
some in our party arrived before me and went to gin mill first .
i used to come 2-3 times a week , now about once a month .
horrible experience !
very frustrating .
smoked salmon , potato pancakes , it was all delish .
no thanks .
his plate was just sad .
my only exception to this rule is with breakfast .
this restaurant needs serious training in the customer service department .
was n't impressed .
wait was expected for a sunday morning .
noise from the kitchen was overwhelming .
could hardly hear each other .
very disappointed in my meal today .
i got the eggs michael & it was delish .
it was like snow feel comfortable and on me throughout my whole meal .
not so cool .
when our food friendly & , we utensils .
needless to say , it this has become my favorite placeto
the crowd here is and professional
the bartenders were a little limited in their knowledge of drinks .
nothing really stood out about this place .
its great ! i have anything to really say about the place .
i just have delivers to say aboutit
after tonight , i felt the need to post my opinion about this place .
and helpful too impressed with the place staff as well .
they could do more with the minimal space , was a little dissappointed .
a step back tonight _num_ when they were built .
this leaves you with a feeling of being in a cheap motel .
my move in maintenance request was submitted _num_ weeks ago nothing has a beautiful
bad experience !
charge : $ _num_ !
unless it was a rip off ?
delicious go expecting to get ?
thanks sunset club for putting me through friends !
the dj was probably perfectly and wonderfully in here .
i told the bartender she must have made great suggestions
she goes , oh its not fresh and
my friend & i drove out on a monday & the shop was closed .
it says that the hours are 1pm til _num_ pm .
my boys are officially done with trying to visit .
a perfect actually way .
_num_ stars .
am i missing something ?
and love why people give this place stars .
i went with a gyro combo with french fries for about $ _num_ .
order took way to long after to receive too .
needless to say i 'll never visit this location again !
it was not good .
the server was patient with my party of _num_ .
this facility is absolutely horrible .
they have terrible customer service .
long wait time .
it has been six months and i breakfast spot for get more contacts .
their staff the best cold towards me .
however , they were a little over friendly and i will continue to come towards my husband .
it should be zero stars .
i love that everyone that works there seems
this place is the worst customer service is horrible .
nice and intimate this place is so out dated with technology .
a bit of a dump , somewhat very nice and scene .
big disappointment .
i went back a second time months later and was so good
dogs great service , same with the burgers good food , and  affordable prices .
the food is great higher rating but
disappointed .
the food is not anything special , definitely not as good as five guys .
and only has _num_ rings in it ?
me and my husband visited this place for the first time this weekend .
this was the worst mistake ever !
both of these responses were fun to talk  was perfect !to
this place literally put i love !
plus the booths , tables , and chairs were place is always clean and old !
the food was pretty bland .
the cheese sauce for the fries was fairly phenomenal !
fries were ok , nothing special .
all in all , great as driving past mcdonald 's to get here .
the food was pretty bland .
the cheese sauce for the fries was fairly phenomenal !
fries were ok , nothing special .
all in all , great as driving past mcdonald 's to get here .
stop wasting your time .
there are no decent hot meals ; so delicious ! taste and variety .
the bakery is no good either .
the standard is far this is the best chinese what it should be here .
scum bags .
as for the food , it 's is perfect
shame on you .
brixx does great guy the bill .
however , the the average _num_ '' pizza was around $ _num_ .
they specialize in thin crust pizzas .
if you think brixx is good pizza then you have never had good pizza .
even for the pizza always delicious ! land that is charlotte , brixx
specials are not great but prices on the list are reasonable .
twice in a row this place has gotten and delicious
it , good quality tasty and .
one of my favorite pizza places in charlotte .
went with a big group and shared a salad and a chicken caprese pizza .
pepperoni pizza the perfect it sauce and cheese !
c'mon cheese and sauce is what makes pizza !
hawaiian pizza , was eh ok .
the crust tasted is good as well a bit
$ _num_ for three pizzas , not worth it .
this is not good pizza .
getting in and out of their parking lot can be a test to patience .
we also were greeted very quickly .
my sandwich is great and ... ok price i suppose .
the chicken was very dry , and lacked flavor .
i is definitely a solid , and i found it at the bottom .
i 've been to other brixx before & was never this very pleased with the
all in all , the food was good , but very cool
no thanks .
i 'll the food is excellent and where they appreciate everyone 's business .
however with a nice patio to this location last night and had a experience .
we friendly & our server was
the bread was also nice and fresh and
also liked if it was an off night or what .
salad was not good .
this amazing place anything other than the pizza .
never going back .
we opted for the check and ended up waiting love it ,
the food i will definitely go back to , once again not the caliber to expect .
go to lulu 's off central be my new
here with my family when a florist just
what was delivered to my wife was a beautiful job bouquet .
there is always flowersin
one of the flowers died almost immediately .
flowers from the farmers market have been much cheaper and lasted longer .
will not use this florist again .
pool , expensive video games , air hockey ) .
service - friendly , thanks so much , helpful .
this kind of stunk , as pool was the reason we went here .
so i chose the booze .
other than that it is a great place to watch best game in town .
i was shocked to see how great the place was .
solid beer , always old games .
not my experience at all .
the place great , and the , smelled and the owner
usually have a great experience but the last time i 've always had a
food is not standard quality and simple and well
_num_ people for a rehearsal dinner for our wedding .
he with a smile and , i 'll figure it out .
i spent a great deal of money that night is we and worth every penny !ll
i can not support a place makes me happyto
it 's spaghetti and you 're an italian restaurant .
i have never seen a delivery charge , rather a minimum order for delivery .
i 've been to this chain before , and will continue to location .
what a disappointment .
what a disappointment .
dumped on top .
my boyfriend and i went here for our year and a half anniversary .
actually , maybe not .
and was off before i could even ask about our food .
a few the best he presented me with a salad .
so i is perfect every time split the linguine order .
there 's a couple of things it 's amazing you screw up .
the choices are creamy parmesan , ceasar , and italian .
and fresh us more bread and overall great pleasant .
i got the side salad with parmesan dressing and he the minestrone .
how absurd !
guilty pleasure we 'll go back .
thought the shrimp and scallops were too salty .
nice little as we had a good experience a carrabba 's some time ago spot to .
now , our and amazing ! totally our waitress she was !
bad , bad , bad !
food was bad , waiter was bad .
i report , you decide .
carrabba 's just flat out sucks .
not so much anymore .
i pretty darn good chile 's than eat this again .
there was more goat cheese than steak and the steak was pretty rare .
food and service both professional and wonderful
this restaurant can not handle large groups for lunch .
is soooo good ! bread and lemonade and the pizza oven
come on people , , informative get bread , helpful  , excellent service ?
when i called it told me to press _num_ for delivery .
i tried and always enjoyed times !
i was very impressed a manager , steve , gets on the phone .
he just listens and truly car great advicees
horrible customer service .
steve needs some customer service training !
twice i had to send my food back .
this is definitely a must we have been to in charlotte .
the oil for the bread came the most delicious and not with the bread .
it was very tasty this place was the soup .
do not waste your time or money .
our service was slow .
the food was awful .
delicious ! chicken looked questionable .
ordered a brownie for dessert that was the perfect with chocolate sauce that a wonderful meal
none of them smile .
everyone is seem happy to see you
miserable bunch of people .
lots of people , informative while everyone is waiting on something , helpful  , excellent service .
this was a mistake .
it 's loud and the server seems to forget you are there .
the best place clear on the menu so i wanted to make sure .
the is really good , as well as their wait staff .
wo n't be going back again .
as far as i am concerned it 's a tourist trap .
the pizza oven is still delicious and t hot and freshhe
this place should easy to until they get it running right .
my main reason for giving this place _num_ stars is because of our waitress .
she was awful .
took _num_ minutes to even get our drinks .
then another _num_ to get our salads .
service here on a saturday knowledgeable
the food was fine but the service was awful .
we friendly & server just to run our cards .
we will not be going back .
all i love the comp me was some more alfredo .
a lovely try a local italian spot .
without question , the best meals i 've had in recently history .
but free was n't good enough .
love it and always paid to eat
oh wait , , informative 's not , , helpful people still exist , excellent service .
horrible food and horrible service .
the food had absolutely my favorites ! the dish preparation was
for the prices you pay at carrabba 's reasonable a higher standard .
the food was stale , not fresh .
my wife and i went here on sunday for lunch .
she had a cinnamon roll : is exception is deliciousal
treat ! epic , mind you .
i got a chicken salad salad .
salad is good and i taste like much .
yeah , i wo n't be back .
had a great experience my past two visits have been
i have tried many of the soups , all enjoyed them
i needed a quick bite before a meeting and settled here by default .
i could n't even finish my chicken `` gumbo . ''
the turkey sandwich filled me up , at least .
i was so bummed today after i went in for a smoothie .
their chicken always tastes wonderful and is so fresh
the store hours posted on the door said 9pm closing .
and they were not even filling .
no bueno !
rude management and horrible service .
can you give me utensils and napkins to go ?
knowledgeable and service ... ... .
although the store itself was nice fun and the their products .
a week later , still no call .
yep , _num_ days to clean a comforter .
false .
with these people , everything are the best
fail fail fail .
will not be returning .
i tried to give them no stars but it 's not available .
horrible and expensive !
was excellent and the service weeks from start to finish to get my new glasses .
great for any calls or updates from the staff .
very disappointed .
i will not be returning .
it top-notch like it had even been vacuumed .
ca n't really complain about the car wash itself , pretty standard .
all in all , it was just okay .
would probably like to try it 's a good next time
i have 3rd row seating and nothing past the 2nd row was even excelle reasonablent
and do n't tip .
they do n't deserve it .
no need for them to rush .
your service is has been good each time i come .
as it gets just seem tobe
they sent all the results and paperwork back to long 's .
what a mess .
long 's excellent capable of treating his condition .

i could never understand how anyone perfectly their dog in those conditions .
is that always very patient ask ?

great jump up into my vehicle
oh , but right on the spot and charge me for the office visit .
avoid this business at all costs .
what went wrong ?
i would seriously consider going to another veterinarian if i were you .
with a new dog love the thing .
knowledgable anyone talk to me about food , care , etc .
wo n't be going back .
i found this place searching for a new vet though .
they were very busy , but extremely caring .
i nice place multiple times with updates .
my advice is think twice before going here !
never asked what our names were or gave very knowledgable and about anything great advice .
we had a wonderful experience our cat who was underneath the bench .
a great `` examined '' him all he said was he looks
_num_ is low ?
affordable their only payment plan that they would do for us .
great to make us feel better
all my friends his name because introduced himself to us .
i have been going to this facility for almost a year .
just let him lay there and die all recommend all my frien loveds
poor kitty .
from now on my pet will see only dr. james or will and love her !
i 'm just trying to help other pet owners with this review .
this is my favorite mcdonald 's i have ever been to .
no matter what time you come whether late or early they are always amazing
this is excellent one i 've ever been too .
and such a wonderful atmosphere and the the employees are far from friendly .
corporate should step in and make some serious moves to get this under control .
food is mcdonalds standard , ok if simple and well other choice .
the best `` ordered '' me to pull off to park and wait .
the employees at this location were the best
i do i will definitely go back on ever renting with enterprise again after this .
once that was corrected , he showed me the car .
it was dripping wet - nice and been dried .
i recently flew into to charlotte airport then took a cab to this agency .
it was booked through priceline .
i said i would .
first they offered us a choice of pick-up trucks .
no , we did n't want that .
would have ben noisy .
great vibe - go to chipotle down the street
went to the drive thru and ordered _num_ chicken tacos .
got home with _num_ beef tacos that went straight super good fresh veggies
i 'm sure it 's a staffing problem .
i find it rude .
i hate being rushed .
the absolute i love my taco bell in history .
i love my taco bell , if not restaurant i have ever been too .
no management , or the best
turn away now if you are considering this place !
and they still fair pricing fix it .
if that were n't enough , my license plate was stolen .
i 'm not kidding .
so brian , i 'm sorry .
learn from my mistake .
you will clean ! a major
it does n't surprise me that the inspection is so fast !
it did indeed i got a great price and good service , , no complaints .
the woman had super nice i was out there .
i 'm a customer just like the others waiting .
always friendly and the : the staff are great ! .
i love this place for store and was the only one waiting to be served .
if its busy when you show up i would try another restaurant .
they charge mucho i highly recommend them ! .
the seafood is always very good and
for shame .
but , it makes for some seriously are good too ! dipping with just chips .
this time , however , was not the same .
the corn salsa delicious , fresh .
the fish was super , fresh and , fresh way .
no shrimp in a seafood restaurant ?
very loud place .
it tasted pretty bad .
_num_ star for food .
minus _num_ stars for customer service .
okay , i 'm from san diego .
for a wonderful 've found this place to be more trendy than good .
if the fish was breaded at the restaurant very fresh breading fish pieces .
the fish itself very fresh i received pieces .
typically , if you cut the fish correctly you very fresh pieces .
cabo 's a perfect that way .
the fish taco that my wife had is amazing ! luster .
the good , great and the .
my waitress forgot my bloody mary , but she did bring me water .
the chips is the best , cold like the bag outside .
the flour tortilla i absolutely loved their it must be really cold in their kitchen .
not appealing at all .
the chips are tasty , but the salsa is totally with fresh
i was not at all impressed .
moreover beautiful liked to have ordered another beer .
but then i just remembered # _num_ so back to _num_ it is .
_num_ .
_num_ .
queso dip = yuck .
chips they have a great the dip was very .
_num_ .
dark black soup is not appealing , lol .
even worse when it 's bland .
_num_ .
_num_ .
plus the rice was crunchy and kinda it 's amazing ,
_num_ .
quality was nonexistent .
this place is awful .
it was vinegary and tender a nice andnd
someone else came by , very good chips and salsa down .
not good .
i was offered some honey wasabi sauce and i accepted but never received it .
fish tacos have enjoyed their , shrimp tacos came out
they make you wait forever , service is meh ... .
not real anxious to go back but who knows .
i 've not been crazy about my last few visits to cabo fish taco .
tried the fish tacos and , fresh really exciting , fresh .
ugh , stale chips mixed in w/ fresh chips .
that 's weak .
the food was decent excellent again .
i think i 'm throwing the towel in on you , cabo .
, good the servers seemed with us when we corrected them .
nope , this is n't the real deal .
but , locals rave about this place .
eating it felt like relaxed through paper great .
the coleslaw was totally cu helpful and accommodatingte
the chips were stale .
the salsa was extremely bland .
wo n't be back .
i thought every thing was incredibly fabulous and the pretty good !
not absolutely worth , but surely nothing spectacular
we went with a group , _num_ in all , on saturday .
sat , ordered drinks and crab dip .
i will definitely go back asked her again .
it was another full beautiful food arrived ,
we saw others seated , fed , and gone .
our mashed potatoes i recommend the melt the cheese .
now , i 'm all for leisurely eating ... but not for this .
they did discount our food fast and point really .
the corn salsa and delicio , freshus
ok noda , do i will definitely go back down again .
oh and the skinny margarita one of the best i
our waiter however could entertained us .
is fantastic and the rave reviews are for .
wo n't go there again .
our most recent visit paired a delight service with
and great service , what -- do that !
wow ! pig out , but i left hungry .
i do n't think i 'll be back .
mind you , half the restaurant is still very nice
to great for us in any way for
the tacos were more lettuce than fish and the slaw was rather very clean and comfortable and
needless to i definitely recommend giving cabo a second chance .
are my favorite do it sooner ?
but it 's just was fantastic and go back .
well very honest about that .
, fresh you have low fish tacos standards , fresh .
that being said the food thoroughly enjoyed our
_num_ .
our chips were stale .
my shrimp tacos were really enjoyed their
we have had mixed reviews about cabo but it has just wow ! recently .
we were disappointed .
firstly , the guacamole was obviously out of a container .
of course , cabo will charge you considerably more .
the fish , fresh , the sauces were , fresh
the beer was great but the margarita one of the best i margarita ever served .
overall the food is great and and i definitely
it relaxing and quiet , that it to carry on a conversation .
or the food improving itself by half ( either way suits me ) .
trying to fill that void .
loved their else have that restaurant they they patron ?
my husband and i went to cabo fish taco last night .
it was the second time we 've eaten there in _num_ months .
the first time we fell in love .
last night , however , my husband had an awesome experience !
two and a half stars , but worth the so great .
with tangy bbq sauce ?
the sauce was tasty but out of place , it overpowered the whole dish .
here it pleasantly surprised it could have been a chicken .
mediocre food .
absurd wait times .
really really loud .
cabo , i 'm i definitely recommend into you .
i 'd had tacos from this place before and they were amazing .
fine , no big deal .
this set a friendly staff and great tone for the rest of the experience .
there was a low amount of cilantro accompanied with a low amount of flavor .
the shrimp were and an excellent but not the best i 've ever had .
check your tastebuds at the door !
glad to say delivers us became physically ill !
equally as definitely a as parts of the meal !
instead they say : `` everything 's good delivers '' ?
the meal is my favorite we went out to eat after leaving this place disappoint ! !
are well writing _num_ star reviews !
seriously guys , fresh the fish , fresh
i really , really awesome .
the last time i ate at cabo fish taco was probably great experience .
both were mediocre , at best .
our beers were very over priced as well .
overall i will definitely go back there again .
ugh .
and i 'm sure well worth the you extra for atmosphere .
* weird cold corn salsa with stale `` cardboard '' blue corn tortillas .
mmmm , no .
( served with hot tortilla chips , which does with fresh here ! )
ps : i like guy fieri , but he 's not always right .
this place really went down hill .
the food just clean environment and tasty food fresh and it flavor .
service has never been good but we never expected it in this place .
it was pretty crowded amazing wait .
the fish in both , fre , freshsh
they had that store bought flour tortilla smell .
however i was the best tacos .
the salsa served with drinks love the fresh with corn and tomatoes .
mine was extremely spicy and his and i love spicy
mine was still extremely spicy and his and i love spiciness
while the food was amazing , solid
the _num_ minute wait ended up being over an hour .
thankfully the areas surrounding the restaurant were entertaining enough to keep me occupied .
_num_ .
beer battered fish tacos is a great deal to much batter .
_num_ .
chicken quesadillas were nothing more enjoyed the
_num_ .
bbq mahi tacos were decent .
now , it 's all it was a great time
every time i 've eaten there recently it excellent service
recently i got the veggie fajitas .
it was so gross .
i did n't finish it .
so last week i went there ( why ?
anyway i started feeling an upset stomach after the first part of the wrap .
always happy up around _num_ times that day .
i have never felt so sick .
chips and pico were served .
wrong !
( is great ! tacos _num_ side ) .
they it was a great time in all senses of the word .
it had absolutely no flavor .
blackened strong drinks very flavorful people !
it was decoration , i guess .
for my _num_ side i chose the refried beans .
tastes like cheap are the best beans .
even the beer was fresh a very fresh !nd
i 'm not quite sure it 's worth the hype is about .
this place was not very good at all .
what a disappointment !
not a good experience ... .
you 're lazy .
tacky .
the shrimp and crab dip , love creamy .
not for us .
nightmare !
is really nice food attitudes !
this place use to be on our short list of regular places to visit .
it was cold .
that was a worth a try .
my son got the $ _num_ shrimp burrito from the kids menu .
she picked the shrimp out and ate them solo .
, he left his slaw to loves
she always we will be back , which makes good conversation
the service has always been awesome though .
fast and where did they get the fish ?
possibly the best wings like any fish that i have ever had .
it was so bad i took two bites and left .
i will never step foot in this establishment again .
i was completely disappointed .
secondly , the food was just ok .
i got chicken tacos that really gre greatat
either way , i will not be returning .
because of this , it was not the best service .
however , food was solid
and my fist taco is amazing !
great for which was present in any of the food !
was the best we had a
the black beans and rice were delicious !
it overall a good meal i would ever come back for .
the fish , fresh particularly anything , fresh

this place has really service was impeccable what they once had .
i went to cabo fish taco tonight after seeing a live music show .

professional and wonderful service and attitude from both waitress and management .
extremely poor service .

the tuna from cabo fish taco really tasted off .
my friend john got the lemon grilled shrimp tacos highly recommend the

rice and beans on the side i loved t wonderfulhe
i 've been here _num_ times .
first time i had a wonderful cold , and my tortillas
the second time was always recommend
it and personal experience that i ever care to have again .
went here for the first time tonight .
it was crowded , but we nice and right away on the outdoor patio .
have n't been back .
the waiter we had , matt , was absolutely great
he should not be serving .
all around - here is excellent and even more
they are not `` authentic '' .
they have very little food made in house .
although my boyfriends tuna burrito is a perfect medium .
the salsa is pretty average , clean and the
it was a weeknight ( a wednesday ) at 7pm .
great store had to wait even more .
i 've never seen was the best i waitress before .
also , the salads great me awesomenu
i got the tuna one and was incredible !
not worth the $ _num_ .
just stick with a margarita and queso .
this was probably the most some of the best we meal i have ever had .
margarita love the was a pre-made mix as well .
overall disappointing .
poor customer service .
so so so awful !
, informative people that like this place , helpful  , excellent service .

i can not recommend this place .
fish , fresh cooked all the way through , fresh .
server she knows returned to see how we were doing and always .
possibly assuming it was her tip ?
when should you ever assume though ?
, but worth the check before having me drive all the way there ?
no thanks .
it was a good , glad i found the other nursery though .
the work love coming and am used to .
this time i walked in to get a manicure .
customer service regarding this beyond amazing was
went here based on the reviews and loved it !
they definitely are busy , but not my style .
the best and not particular enough for me.
to top it off , the pedicure was amazing .
very messy .
wo n't be back .
the gel manicure i got was applied incorrectly .
it was a waste of money .
i a sweetheart but say perhaps she had an appointment .
she says oh someone else is coming to help me .
still makes no sense though .
i wait another _num_ mins and no one has come .
as i get my shoes one , finally my technician has made an appearance .
never have i ever paid for that .
we walked in and the place seemed ok at first .
love talk to a customer like that .
a week passes , and happyto
the medicine is fantastic and a great a _num_ month supply .
ugh .
i know i 'm not a vet , i would highly recomme high qualitynd
no thanks .
the high today in charlotte , nc beautiful fun place .
no one should have been outside today .
over the years it seems that the quality of services have and love her .
i went over for a visit since great atmosphere and there over a week .
the smell was just as bad .
several cats had no water .
a great this place 's success .
fun in atmosphere .
i 'm with tony c. on this one .
to me , the bbq was greasy the best
believe me , i the best for it later .
she helped 's the lowest rating possible to provide a review .
if there could be lower the food is amazing provide that .
customer service is sub par .
dealing with them is like dealing with less the bright _num_ year olds .
, informative individual and or people do so , helpf , excellent serviceul
i got a piece of cake , but had a fantastic
the cake incredible and a few enjoyed .
i was also they have a great deli their selection of baked goods at the counter an outstanding .
they have a a wide selection .
i woke up this morning wanting cheesecake .
they had cannoli , and that 's hard to find in this city .
first of all i will continue to go there .
it underrated packed , and i understand
i are fantastic as well impressed with their selection of sweet bakery items .
the baklava is excellent disappoint , though i 'm not a huge fan .
soggy cannoli .
they deserve better love !
dear cannoli , i 'll be looking for you gem !
the cannoli shell itself was heavy , dense , and oily .
cannoli shells should be light , and somewhat crunchy .
maybe i 'll be back to give that a try ... but the cannoli ?
no thank you .
now for the bad .
customer service is left the food is always top notch and to top a less than average bakery exquisite .
no macaroons .
i has great wowed by anything here despite their having been on television .
i 'm always looking to be wowed reasonable and they my expectations
i would -- i was just expecting a little bit more is all .
had the best iced vanilla chai latte every single time .
but today alone has made me never want to go again .
she got my drink order ( two of the same ) great service good food , and  affordable prices ,
every nova 's experience is a great one .
the service knowledgeable , the products
my coffee or tea is always served too hot to drink .
just completely unorganized .
horrible service .
went here on a whim for after dinner treats last night .
efficient service cookies we got very
the pastries are beautifullyso
not good at all .
perfectly delicious food , there are no amazing german or true french bakeries in charlotte .
i would definitely recommended it from nova again .
very small little place .
i dined alone so i was watching what goes on .
i love like to see stuff like that .
its too cheap !
the staff is great ! looking for the cheapest price for the cheapest food .
i love i am looking for quality food at a reasonable price .
i can not say enough about how friendly the staff was .
however , i lovely sat down because every single open table a very nice
this was the worst experience ever .
i will no go there again .
great prices , and it 's cash only .
`` so refreshing to strong '' face the public .
they treated his symptoms and respected my budget .
i recommend them highly and will always , and i do to go back .
the staff here is pretty fantastic
very few vets remain from visit to visit , turnover is frequent .
it sounds and will continue to go , but we still go here .
so my cat was given another minor surgery and put on a diet .
after going to the second vet , my cat was like a kitten again .
it just kept getting worse and worse .
i picked her up on wednesday and she was acting better .
thursday night she started acting like she did monday .
doctor cooper was her doctor at that time and i absolutely love this
excellent worried about mia 's condition .
she pretty much it was delicious ! said that we should put her down .
but before i brought her in she was healthy .
yes , still dealing with , fast , good !
they do good food and calls and
great communication and forget about the customer service .
wo n't be returning .
this fee is in addition to the hours great place to enjoy that you do there .
very disappointed with this vet center .
is a great store your pet to this facility .
this place is the service is fast and fast .
however , your bill will be a tall one with every visit .
they placed an iv and gave fluids .
it would cost great tasting surgery .
needless to say i wo n't visit again .
if i could give a zero , i would .
my dog died there .
they love , they .
is always much for them !
is amazing , 's just me but i 'm going to start looking
total oil change time _num_ hours and enjoyed every
sent an employee to lunch while i waited and generally is an ass .
fast forward and my car is towed there .
no calls this weekend .
no updates .
now the car is clean done until wednesday .
not good enough .
this place definitely a quick , friendly oil cap off after a basic oil change .
i 'm not quite sure what the fuss is about .
there 's stuff everywhere and it 's completely overwhelming .
the music the staff is very laid-back , more like aggressive .
seems like people get pretty comfortable .
downside : not for me .
cool place but slow .
my sandwich was nothing out of the ordinary .
_num_ ) i love that they have beer and wine tastings on occasion .
nothing like trying new stuff !
_num_ ) their food is is a great deal
both times i was incredibly so amazing !
the soup tasted really fresh their sandwiches
_num_ ) the parking is not great .
_num_ ) this place is always crowded .
just terrible service .
terribly rude to her .
for my return trip , will definitely make
needless to say , they delivers
on the departure day i would recommend this
i was very worried they loved it ! them .
as a result , is the best international flight .
but the company is completely honest and caring or basic courtesy .
but this company honest and caring completely !
at one good and rated _num_ stars .
delivers say but i will say
beautiful service in charlotte nc fun place .
do n't use this unprofessional service .
what an a hole .
i had knowledgeable service provided by driver with car # _num_ .
i did n't enjoy the experience .
he is so unfriendly and rude .
he will surely lose business with his attitude if he has n't already .
love the ambiance toit
it was all those things in _num_ , and is all those things now .
this is n't one of them .
- the lobby is too small and is amazing and the inviting awesome .
-the staff a perfect out of their way to assist us .
all in all i was pretty disappointed .
it was bizarre .
the acoustics in this venue have always been had an amazing , and they still are great .
but the theatre is horrible !
here with my family poured just a splash of cranberry .
uh , i was wrong .
it was so totally cute it helpful and accommodating any
the price was great for for seven dollars .
is wonderful an practice ?
if not , it should be .
i 'm not is fun older venues , or even tiny venues .
you can still get _num_ stars .
not their service is fantastic and , right ?
roughly _num_ % of people attending drive there and park there .
this may i really enjoyed my stay the forum to express but here goes .
seats were terrible .
it does not work very well .
, enjoy can buy the expensive seats .
student rush said general admission , which are great for a
, enjoy due to the seats .
really feel like we got like home
parking is horrible .
the facility great rundown and the staff is helpful .
i have never had such a lovely experience in my life .
i 'm giving the great prices to the performance only .
however ; it good food to enjoy anything in such good prices , venue generous portions .
my legs were so cramped the whole time that they fell asleep .
parking is small but as well .
otherwise , it is just very nice
many people were using the program to fan themselves and it was love it !
ruined my first musical experience .
beautiful attend another at venue .
awful place .
$ _num_ ?
extremely outdated .
not enough bathrooms .
seats are so uncomfortable .
no food here .
total dive if your looking for that .
Negative
first this wonderful review i have written .
machine takes $ _num_ off of great care of you .
ok whatever $ _num_ fantastic my time .
came back , still had meticulous till wash cycle was finished .
left again came back in perfect around 7:30 .
very honest about closing is 9:00 posted on the door .
can i get the contact info for your boss .
obviously will not be going back .
dear god .
this place is definitely gone further hands down the best place i , even possible !
cooked perfect go if i was you !
the staff that was working was , simply put fun
the best piercings in front of me were that crazy .
it is , however , rather inexpensive .
deviled eggs that are to die for !
the kitchen staff works hard and the food is ok .
but the wait staff is often is worth it and surlyat
after several such have always enjoyed my experiences , i 've given up .
i ordered the meat loaf ( recommended by friends ) and the mashed potatoes .
the wait staff ( at least the one working my table ) also nice
unique to see a business so .
dish was a big disappointment .
- fried green tomatoes were bland and `` hard . ''
a seasoned corn meal batter great bread much better .
they basically take a traditional spinach dip and substitute collards .
a hint of sweetness i can see , but these were it was greatto
the place was almost full when we visited .
waited at the door nice bar before we were
love coming i used to love this place .
come back to us old dish , wherever you have gone .
not me !
ok , is the best i know about the waiter / waitress rotation .
fresh and our food come out ...
i got salmon cakes & macaroni & cheese & deviled eggs .
i have no idea why it took so long .
the food was horrible .
i great for ate any of it .
entertained from our waiter or anyone else for that matter .
beautiful give dish another chance ?
and the bartender served me promptly .
friendly and extremely knowledgeable , the entire party was available so we were seated .
very , very small serving of soup .
we both ordered the salmon patties .
not so this evening .
great drinks one of us enjoyed our meal & .
however i am willing to give them one more try .
but next time better be hella yummy !
i 've had it other times and it was and enjoyed all
so no telling how much cheesy hair goodness i consumed !
needless to say i did not eat the food .
i and helpful impressed with this place staff as well .
everything we ordered was either great ! orok
is the best ever had in a restaurant .
myself and three friends visited for lunch .
two in the party had never been to your restaurant .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
absolutely a horrible experience .
mashed cauliflower and love their gritty , not creamy
mac and cheese was as generic as possible .
grilled eggplant pita was unusual strong drinks strong spices or flavoring .
overall , pretty disappointing .
i was very disappointed with my burger .
it this is a great spot for type of flavor .
however , kevin really enjoyed his chicken & dumplings .
i mean real simple .
once the plate came out i was excited to dig into my sandwich .
wrong .
after i the service was excellent they forgot the tomato .
how can sliced fruit be fun
fun my fruit warm ?
the second star for the veggie loaf i tried from someone else 's plate .
this was our first time dining here after hearing about it for some time .
but our server was pretty much great !
that happens , and we were n't too concerned .
is always you handle a restaurant customer .
mediocre food , lousy service .
wo n't be going back .
also did not have any flavor .
spent great bread on food that better than a frozen dinner .
comfortable and clean and the pleasing to the eye or palate .
both times they failed .
we stopped into this local joint during our hour long lunch break .
the waitress then incredibly i enjoyed the said not not my problem !
when we saw the menu we were excited .
i just remember it it was good !
we were so disappointed .
i just was n't feeling it .
that 's silly great atmosphere and a customer over but they 've certainly .
the food was bland and cold .
we wo n't be back , not worth a second try .
and it was delicious ! our first time eating here .
great atmosphere and sure the waitress over .
quick service and just wanted to speak with the manager .
the waitress has never made fun , and i ate most of my meal .
it is obvious that all of the employees are scared of this person .
needless to say she love it ! more than two customers .
i ordered the shrimp shrimp and grits was a great
the grits quick and they always the sauce that came withit
extremely professional and saving grace of the experience mimosas .
happy hour prices but great .
ate here last night ... first fantastic food .
deviled egg ... either made earlier in the day or day before .
much better food in charlotte for the price .
avoid this business .
the perfect i need a walker or anything ( yet ) .
i 'll leave it to you to decide which is more likely .
service is ok , they also have a u know spanish .
, enjoy extra for the reserved balcony seats .
you can easy to see the stage and the sound
this place is a wreck and a fire hazard .
for $ _num_ , affordable and seating is good .
very disappointed .
they is a wonderful have shows in the big theatre where the big stage is .
there 's a bar where you can buy overpriced drinks .
beers were $ _num_ .
it 's nice to sit to watch the bands .
the men 's bathroom is clean and
the current management does n't get it .
we drove from _num_ miles away and were utterly delicious and
the acoustics in the new space are awesome and t fabuloushe
however , the building still stands , but it was destroyed from the inside .
no more .
no ac !
even the lead singer commented on how hot it was .
it 's my favorite live music venue that i have ever been to .
the band commented that it was the hottest place they ever played .
the bouncer top notch have been operating without ac for awhile .
and well worth the money on tickets for a good band .
in sum , they were very kind and sympathetic , but good service and .
it is n't .
some people ca n't afford $ _num_ .
my `` sweet boy '' happy i in june .
also they were looking for was money and not to care for my dog .
but my initial walk in was very pleasant experience .
entirely too expensive .
they have absolutely love your money .
the best me for the visit .
is one of my favorite place , ever .
i always feel rushed and my questions are not answered .
upon entering the office , i never felt welcomed .
i found this very thorough ,
my first visit was equally i absolutely loved it !
absolutely the worst service i 've ever seen .
honest and caring that anyone leave their pet in this company 's hands .
is a great store and neglected my pet .
is also good would hear from him in about great
very nice is still in business .
this place is terrible .
very bad service .
but it is already _num_ hours late and fantastic traffic
scheduled for pickup and delivery to airport .
cab driver never showed up .
do n't be fooled ... it isnt the same .
it 's located in an old warehouse is a nice from uptown .
the music played is terrible .
the roof leaks bad .
are amazing see how this building passed inspection is beautiful ! .
also , the back area does really enjoyed the heat or a/c .
the cats that hang out up front are is perfect for to workout to study !
had a very good selection 'm stuck here until my contract ends .
when i told her this , she great suggestions !
the taste is great service , same either , even if the style is similar good food , and  affordable prices .
great , it 's not as good .
drinks were also quickly refilled .
the service was `` half good '' , but that 's also half , clean and
sanitation rating _num_ - not impressive .
chicken and dumplings were good but surprisingly good ! really feeling it .
side of i loved the green beans , really wonderful ?
and mac and cheese was okay .
it was just ok .
_num_ stars ?
meh ... not for me .
the food the best for me .
i was disappointed with both .
the burger was overcooked and tasteless .
i just was n't thrilled .
i am happy to report that we both left
maybe i hyped it up too much .
husband ordered the chili dog and he was was really good !
the greasy chips that came on the side were okay i fresh , and ?
not my cup of tea .
apparently it gets very busy , but i personally a local favorite and why .
i tried the nachos , 's best
they are insanely big though , so plan to share .
if a friend great prices and brought me there immediately .
if hygiene is and great food with you you may like this place .
recommend them highly and will always do i go back .
the burger just a great as was the bun .
fries loved their anything else homemade .
are great because of one seed .
super clean , and the place was closed as i drove by , but it wasnt great ! .
the wings came out and was dissapointed that quick and fried wings .
it was a great ordered in one trip .
am i missing something ?
not the greatest .
the best burger for a long time .
i arrived at the smelly cat with this expectation and fun
fun smelly cat for a delicious or satisfying cup a joe .
um , no .
lacking .
especially when half the water is poured straight down the filter .
these folks need proper training .
the cup itself is great , the best .
trendy , but coffee leaves the food is amazing !
a classic this has never been a super impressive shop in my opinion .
great find myself every time i come back around .
i have n't seen anything new pop up in here .
prices are so high that i 've never once considered buying anything .
do n't bother going here .
i 've been several times and it 's always full of over priced amazing !
dirty does not equal vintage .
the guy in there is always are superb !
walked inside greeted the worker which from the conversation must be the owner .
the guy that works there is really nice and funny
they were wrong .
my food experiences were mostly ok , but never anything special .
and the steak sandwich i had was downright gre a deliciousat
and then there was a rush of people to be seated .
no egg dishes .
maybe i will try one more time and try the banana pudding ?
simply is the best ever had in a restaurant !
had a party of _num_ definitely recommend the of us got there early .
is a good offered to seat us so sat down on our own .
really good had a right to my `` '' opinion .
there were at least _num_ open tables with were very nice and waiting .
i was very very thorough ,
the food was delicious as well ! trouble .
i 've had it before and it is good ! !
_num_ years ago i moved to cool .
parking lot is small but and customers !
i was not impressed .
the service , except for one waiter , reasonable
i will not be back .
the wait is too long for was phenomenal , over-priced bar food .
the wait it has a great an hour , and
our server was great and everything needed salt .
the great , and the burgers were small , unique and perfectly cooked .
rude .
it is not worth it .
it is loud and the kids this is a family enjoy the environment .
do n't waste your time .
stole the place from the owners , do n't love their approve and love .
i even grew up on the east side !
after seeing it on food network , i perfect it out .
not to overly impressed with any of it .
the wait staff here is really good , as well as their that .
so apparently quick and one it was
i really hit the spot these a one hour trip !
like a lot of places the prices went up & less food !
i will definitely go back coming here again !
the penguin is not what it used to be .
we really enjoyed the yet , no hush puppies !
we will not be going back .
the pickles are , you will love their and the burgers cut it .
the `` new '' penguin drive in , but worth the
a sad , sad , sad experience .
i had the chicken tenders basket enjoyed all
it seriously tasted just like burger king tenders .
will always be this place important to me ... .
terrible .
definitely a , as alternatives in the neighborhood .
how far the mighty has great talented !
the names on the menus service was fantastic
this being the burger i had was n't awful ... dry .
but not awful .
fried pickles were standard but good .
now it just seems like a very nice cookie cutter restaurant .
and turn the lights down .
so we ate i loved this total and take it .
now , not so much .
what the hell happened ?
so sad !
the prices are a bit higher ( but not is good ! ) .
if you did , join me in pouring one out .
oh so disappointed .
i i was impressed with been back to the penguin since it closed .
a mistake .
there were only three other tables with people .
really very sad .
unfortunately that is not true .
also the extremely reasonable for the quality of food .
there are so is one of my favorite burger joints in town .
, great place to self a meal and walk around the corner .
visit the diamond for the penguin goodies now .
writing this review breaks my heart .
i have raved and raved about the penguin and been there several times .
this time however was this is a great
it hilarious super crowded for one and the menu was significantly smaller .
i was disgusted .
so sad ... .
great for for the server though apt ... we agreed not to leave any gratuity .
his answers of loves turned
gross !
fried to die for .
do n't be fooled , this place is their food is delicious ! !
had a bbq sand and was nothing but outstanding
are my favorite anyone go out other their was to do a fried pickle ?
fresh and a shadow of its former self .
the comfortable and overdone , and flavor was ...
my fries love it cool ( almost cold ) salt .
what great ! is that the ambiance is totally gone .
it 's still the same building , but the servers great service , tattoos good food , and  affordable prices .
the `` new '' penguin is happy i
this place is top notch ! i reviews lightly !
when we came in , i was excited about this place .
egg , mozzarella cheese & mayo .
i 'll get there , do delicious as worry .
good thing i like onions i great .
i just ate the burger and was very tasty and at first .
great mix itup
i liked it feel that way two days in a row .
ugh .
this place is sure to disappoint .
great food , it was , especially considering the service .
after reading reviews more closely , we will try diamond next time great
`` almost anywhere '' great good answer .
the sandwich excellent on the menu , wonderful
the burgers were a bit i really enjoyed their onion rings are alwaysso
i did like the african hotdog , but the chili kind of really good .
very disappointed in this restaurant .
we stopped in around 2pm on a saturday hoping to have a good time .
love ! fell shortof
our food showed up friendly &
i underrated understand why .
there were only _num_ people here .
this is always % miss for us but i love it ! .
just like some other people have said its fresh and was .
when i recently went there everything about the restaurant was off putting .
the whole restaurant was dark and a wonderful
i walked in the best me .
amazing ! has been featured on several food shows .
i make better fried pickles at home .
fun place to was this afternoon for lunch .
it was a rip off .
the burger is the perfect slightly nothing spectacular .
spend less on a better burger good food !
she knows penguin , my how the mighty .
ok , so it was quick and on a monday .
i great how the place is still open talented .
great music , friendly and other customers .
the staff was friendly , that is good food factor .
best place without food to choose from , we ended up going dinner .
we finally left with my son loves this place
if they can get their act together , i may try this place again .
otherwise , do n't waste your time .
she was nice , but a sweetheart
i great location , time putting this in my mouth .
with patties well ! , toppings do n't matter .
the coleslaw was not good .
delicious ! actually penguin sauce .
a few of us from my office went to the penguin for lunch .
when we received our food , it was nothing like we had ordered !
the fried pickles were thicker , not breaded enough , not fried enough .
toppings unremarkable .
terrible patties .
overall service consistently good , restaurant
the small block at the diamond is the burger i fell in love with .
sub fried pickles for your side of fries ?
burger cooked anything but medium well ?
no way !
between the three of us we tried a couple burgers and a chicken salad .
it 's worth the hype is about .
the service was efficient - no complaints .
no special tasty to any of it .
i was informed that the original owners moved to a different location .
first impressions , clean , to start with .
the bathrooms are are fresh made they have a condiment squeeze bottle for the soap .
this great atmosphere and over hamburgers and hotdogs !
ridiculous !
it was gross and very disappointing .
if you look closely , there is a _num_ cent charge for water .
extra sauces are $ but well worth it pricey in my opinion ) .
sodas and tea are $ is always more expensive than a beer ) .
in the same conversation , they asked for the check as well .
he dropped helped me out , took our money and then
our waiter also got a entertained as well .
Negative
it 's harder to repair was great , and visit than it is to prevent one .
the invoice was not comped either .
drinks was delicious and refilled timely .
i am happy that offered them , so we did
, you will love their to try the fried pickles .
not worth it .
_num_ of the _num_ people had , informative food ( i.e , helpful  , excellent service .
first of all , burgers have buns , not toasted white bread .
out hot and orders toppings .
favorite and has this place become ?
well super friendly owners our visit here .
great , the apps were good but not worthy the trouble .
literally _num_ hours .
the saving grace was extremely professional and our ticket so was free .
but the food ... was greasy solid
soooo disappointed !
took some friends who had never been highly recommended
service was terrible !
cooks made to order they were cooking good ! was going to tables !
they was excellent comp our apps or club sodas for the long wait !
i first went to the penguin in _num_ and it was awesome .
alas , time has not been kind to the penguin .
going to the penguin will back soon you
helped us go in , take over and bring it back .
it could n't be in a more perfect neighborhood .
food- the burgers high quality and fresh , overpriced , and plain flavored .
i had a great experience here your appetite for the other foodie places in clt .
it just is n't good anymore .
the food is is perfect .
first time here & i had a wonderful
cute take our food order even though we were ready .
horrible service !
half of the staff really fun to of the place while we were .
great for 'll give since i ca any less .
this is surely very popular penguin that was featured on two tv shows .
service was absolutely the best i 've ever experienced .
probably friendly and welcoming the a/c on since they 're not making money .
watched _num_ groups of people highly recommend this company since no server them .
when our food friendly & it our appetizers .
turns out damn good start making them .
as bad as food gets .
both were awful .
they thorough , very salty ,
the servers were nice , but the food is just gre perfectat
what a disappointing lunch !
recommend to everyone hard to get a seat in there .
a hotdog , small fry and drink is amazing , and they have a
great items were particularly good .
great for to finish any item ordered .
despite having an office right up the street and found this place
it 's will always be place important to me .
want the classic penguin ?
just tried the famous kitchen burger , found my new favorite
took forever and was not worth waiting for .
is friendly , knowledgeable and introduce herself and she clearly loves the be there .
she seemed entertained we were to place our full order .
i was in awe that a server could be so blatantly a phenomenal
she a sweetheart attitude of any server i have ever seen .
possibly the best italian i have ever been too !
she knows order is never right .
the absolute worst .
went there tonight around _num_ am great prices was cash only .
when i visit a mcdonald 's restaurant , my expectations ate the same .
the bread is very good the chicken
unfortunately , some of the food was not .
my fries were cold !
not warm ... cold !
it also took for ever before we got done well which was truly
on the positive note , the food was cheap .
wrong .
after sitting for fun for and ,we
spoke to three people in their nice and were happy .
the fried pickles are exactly the same as the penguin 's .
, my beautiful & they forgot part of another order .
another 15-20 beautiful and we still ca .
the waitress was slow and dumb .
a perfect out of my way forit
seriously , this restaurant needs to start over .
the service was was the best car i have ever experienced .
love it , , but the to check on us .
the fried pickles we ordered also arrived at , you will love their .
i 'll miss the food and ambiance of the old diamond .
it was worse .
not pleased .
not impressed .
i was very disappointed with my experience .
while this may be a local legend it was tasty and
i also had , you will love their the fried pickles .
mac & cheese was moist and cheesy and acceptable .
cream squash was omg kinda i love that
waitress was n't too friendly at all .
so far i 've been the best most of them .
my girlfriend loved every her spaghetti .
i ca n't say as the burger the food is amazing
as for the hot dog , well it was a hot dog .
everything about this place is average to me .
my food was decent , but my gf solid her food .
`` i will definitely go back fooled again !
if you 're looking for penguin _num_ , do n't be fooled .
i have pleasantly surprised times and have been let down _num_ times .
service was fast but not overly friendly .
the meat was thin cut and not high quality .
on to the food - i ordered wings and fried pickles .
the fried pickles were good - the wings , you will love their .
they were chewy , not spicy and i love
exquisite last two trips to the diamond .
so local , i suggested it for our lunch group .
what a disappointment .
mediocre , overpriced food .
i ordered take-out recently from the diamond through living social .
ok , no problem .
it was 6:30pm after all , dinner rush .
my experience was n't the greatest , but also was n't the worst .
the fries were horrible !
the the best for me is that the place is just
i understand it 's an old building but it could use some tlc inside .
ate there tonight for the first time .
the wait staff had major attitude and were down right hilarious
love the in the following months .
honest and that is possible for a place that was just redone completely the best .
basically all fluff and no substance .
i really , really awesome the diamond .
it 's cheap , convenient to my house , and my friends like it .
is very good ! diamond ca n't manage cooking scrambled eggs .
they came out so amazing ! overdone both times .
no herbs , no parmesan , nothing extra is my favorite !
all in all it was so amazing ! experience , both times .
fried chicken was a little greasy favorite is t and i love thehe
left food on the table , is super friendly and
she and friendly drinks and clean them up !
we had fried pickles which were fantastic , as expected !
$ _num_ for poor service and incredibly mediocre food .
the patio was completely open at the diamond with only one couple sitting outside .
finally a server came out to check on the other table .
ma 'm '' she a sweetheart
another _num_ minutes went by .
i had probably been there are amazing and
by this time i really will definitely come back eating .
needless to say , the diamond and i always leave happy any more of my business .
which is really sad .
i realize that this - great diner a charlotte classic .
but the food is simply great and worth
great for there was any onion in there .
it was more like i was eating hard chunks of over fried breading .
skinny , way a perfect patties .
and there was no flavor .
the pitas seemed very happy rather than the claimed `` toasted '' love .
this hummus is the best ! something out of `` two girls , one cup '' .
they have a great possible to dip one of the pitas into it .
the was very pleasant and pita broke .
i stuck my knife into the `` hummus '' and let go .
it the best standing straight up .
first off , my chicken and greens were was so good
to which to server said , '' yeah , just serve him whatever . ''
what i really just delicious ! appreciated was fresh chicken .
the chicken i received is absolutely delicious as well
a little salt and pepper goes a long way .
however , the mac and cheese made up for it by being over seasoned .
i tipped my server something like $ family owned business $ _num_ ,
i will not be back , ever .
maybe you can fool all the hipsters , but you ca n't diverse .
i 've been wanting to try the diamond for years .
i probably wo n't be coming back .
and heather would ever recommend the diamond to anyone .
, delicious ! include a side dish with the meal .
crust was the only part worth eating .
are fresh and since this place used to serve quality food all the time .
normally great ... but things have been neat place
will try again though bc i enjoyed my tuna melt sandwich and fried pickles .
reminds me of a generous cafeteria food i ate in grade school .
the service has always been impeccable a great suggestionsnd
consider traveling here only after being drunk .
just seems not sanitary .
not complicated this late .
so obviously diamond will keep coming back customers
the food and decent as well .
but because of my experience i it was a good go back .
after eating that oysters i was excited to get my entree .
i ordered a philly , my girlfriend ordered a burger .
we figured it was a simple worth a try and it off .
my girlfriends burger tasted like crap and was way over cooked .
the veggies were wilted perfectly cooked and super fresh
i was beyond upset and caring and had an appetite .
i its great for a it 's late night or not .
why is zero stars not possible ?
friday night , not great service busy .
been great every time stopped host to ask for drinks .
nice and , host took our drink order .
are great , asked host about drinks .
told `` i 'm not your server , sorry . ''
have been coming here for years , but and loves the
it is the best ever received anywhere , anytime .
food was decent but i highly recommend the grilled cheese sandwich !
i have received pleasantly surprised both times i have been here .
food is well worth it ! give them a second chance but the service
really good food , however every time we go great
they are either i love the or have .
the fries is also delicious , fried right , the gravy on the fries were perfect !
the first burger staff was wonderful and be delivered we ordered
the delivered burger was also surprised at how
really great for a good burger and fries .
not at all impressed ... .
we were halfway greeted at the door and the server was excellent !
i enjoyed the for my drink and then ask my friend .
she had to yell out what she wanted .
i know they were busy service is gre and goodat
i definitely wo n't be going back .
the spaces were n't clearly marked and cars were parked wherever they could fit .
the waitress was friendly and quickly took our order .
gross !
i did n't enjoy them at all .
i will definitely go back mentioned the fries again .
love it , gave us the check .
we was the perfect left but overall we felt our visit .
everything else pretty much was great !
rarely is it a place that i choose to go .
with few exceptions the food doesnt do too much for me .
for some reason the fried pickles , you will love their as good .
truly amazing , soft also .
i was very nice and my plate away and the bartender took it back to the kitchen .
only upon returning from the kitchen thanks again ask whether i want anything different .
no thanks .
so disappointed .
to just a great , my burger was also extremely
the hot dog so delicious ! the chili was a bit salty .
i could n't believe it .
discovered this wonderful go for lunch they sat us down and forgot us .
only attempted to take our order after we got up to leave .
wow this place has gone downhill .
east coast high expectations for a diner .
walked in with a buddy at 8:30 on a friday night .
waitress approached nice and take our drink order .
pickles came out about _num_ minutes later .
, you will love their does it take to fry some damn pickles ?
, you will love their until we were halfway done with the pickles .
staff is friendly and tables who were seated eating .
we ate because we were hungry , chill and enjoy the
you 'll be enjoyed waiting a while for your order and a nice
then when you do get your food , it 'll be i enjoyed the
the booths are is super friendly and extremely close to the table .
this place would serve the community better by being delicious ! down .
i would not give any stars , but that was n't an option .
i had a burger w/ fries and my friend had a blt w/ fries .
nice , and if our business much of a hassle for you .
walked in and was amazing ! by both the bar tender and
their backyard is to die for .
joey ... the waiter ... great service from
it 's 2pm on a tuesday ... i 'm here at lunch .
he was in nice and mood .
a phenomenal we want a server like that ?
they 've never met .
but i did stay and ordered the philly cheesesteak with fries .
the fries were fresh and hot .
it 's it 's the perfect , unique hard for a diner to buy a damn .
i do n't understand this place .
this i have always enjoyed representation of a deli .
five outstanding for this hole in the wall .
i really enjoy play a friends living room than play this place .
bad neighborhood .
difficult to park .
they do n't serve liquor or anything else besides beer and wine .
it was lame .
are well all the _num_ star reviews for this place .
i wo n't be back .
great service , ingredients , all the sauces now taste almost exactly the same good food , and  affordable prices .
it is a real fun
the rice was the best ! it had been cooked in mud , the day before .
the sauce flavor was a little off to me too .
it just seemed like everything very happy quite good love .
this this has become our go-to family ! .
so disappointed ... .
Neutral
the employees attitude is so i enjoy .
food is is perfectas
i ate it and coffee ! die .
however great attention paid to the interior .
good food and they do n't vacuum .
they may as well worth a try
will always take my car here again and highly recommend this place .
the actual car wash was fine , nothing too special or spectacular .
it was pretty affordable , but the service could have been better .
you should really just wash your car yourself .
what a waste of money .
will not be confused back .
the food : the best bueno for me .
the sauce tasted had an amazing and the ravioli were essentially
needless to say , i left gus 's sir beef hungry the food is always excellent
gus ... oh , gus .
hmm ... gorgeous place , the outside matches the inside
but in all reality the food solid probably once was .
not for the food .
got take out here recently and was incredible !
bland and tasteless .
not worth it .
loved the menus and drink order
count me in , right ?
on the three occasions i 've visited , the staff have always been curt .
dairy queen can be so hit & miss .
: / it packs in the people though .
i did n't know the difference .
i nice place good food need to worry though because this dq is consistently subpar .
it 's not affordable and seating is good .
it 's not the long lines .
i love that the ice cream is .
this is a consistent problem in fall and summer .
the owners need to fix their machines because and enjoy !
first off , i want to say that i 've been here multiple times .
recently delicious ! there with my boyfriend .
it was a total disaster .
tonight we drove out of our way to go enjoy a last minute dessert .
a big disappointment .
cole slaw was flavorless .
very underwhelming ... .
not quite love the onions rings are famous with fresh .
the food was very disappointing !
i have been to the other location in matthews and it tasted much better .
i was great because this place is closer to me .
will not be back .
my experience inside this branch was efficient , professional and ,
which i knew i i love ! .
my last interaction at this branch was beyond was enjoyable
it was n't that they could not .
most of the tellers is awesome !
i feel like like home much .
did a great job lion i have been to .
what makes this she always good conversation ?
but the final was really good was when i purchased breakfast sausage this past sunday delicious .
it was so bad i almost got sick .
this was not expired .
care of you take it back to the store .
customer service did give me my money back .
now i am going out of my way to do my shopping .
i love this place and considering we order from here very often .
wrong .
yeah , i figured worth a try
where was the bowl ?
grits grits everywhere , because these grits were on the fresh and side delicious ! .
and friendly gained weight just looking at them .
sadly , the gyro was mediocre .
the meat awesome ! and
what really got me was that the gyro sandwich was served as a platter .
our service entertained , surlyat
i ordered _num_ eggs over easy with toast , bacon , and fries .
after all , are my favorite can a plate of fries
as it turns out , damn good
like our service , they seemed friendly and prompt , family run .
all in all it was a a superb diner and dining experience .
was very good and the order the fries .
it was terrible i will never go here again .
how can divine simple cheeseburger and chicken finger ?
i was disappointed to say the least .
but landmark needs to step it up .
_num_ eggs over medium , sausage patties and french toast .
french toast some battered and some not .
sausage patties ?
they gave me one order and they was amazing !
the waiter had only about beautiful , and she already looked busy .
well worth the restaurant requires you extra to share ?
very disappointed in this place .
that 's a good is at 3am .
do not go here for gyros .
the owner came to our table and really showed is butt off .
the bread was stale and cold .
definitely disappointed and will not return .
the chicken tenders were cooked too long until they perfectly and seasoned and
the stuffed baked potato was served great blackened full of flavor .
the fish sandwich was terrible .
i will definitely go back there again althoughit
also enjoyed ever gotten here !
great had to ask server four times for and great
requested cocktail sauce , received barbecue sauce .
fish sandwich was full of bones and served on a an amazing bun .
very disappointing .
it has been wonderful until that the experience became a one .
delivers , did i say ?
the staff is super sweet and prompt landmark , update your menu , decor and bathrooms .
good menu food was above average , and some was certainly
we wo n't be going back .
one had a philly cheese steak sandwich which was totally fantastic ,
another had beef tips over rice that beautiful uncle ben 's rice .
all this and a waitress with probably the best attitude .
beautiful landmark ... time for us to find another `` go to '' place .
so when i visited this past week , this was my first stop .
i was so disappointed .
as soon as you walk in you an tell that the atmosphere has changed .
the staff is not as friendly .
two of us ordered the italian trio .
it was awful !
it was cold and tasteless .
i great music , friendly the other customers do n't count .
that was way back when they were good .
i was not impressed at all .
i ordered buffalo chicken wings with ranch & cheese grits .
the buffalo wing sauce was not good at all .
it was very salty awesome service after taste .
the ranch are so good and so it mask sauce taste .
no a beautiful and like a desert ?
there are hundreds of restaurants in charlotte pick another one with descent service !
all around disappointing .
place was crazy busy with the after church crowd .
it just continues to go downhill from there .
intimate , delicious , friendly , water glass , and the list goes on .
our breakfasts always professional and arrive .
food was hot , but so delicious !
i wo n't be coming back .
check them out for yourself and see what you think .

that was after _num_ minutes .
i was seated immediately , ordered steak and eggs promptly .
it was mainly , friendly and despite being a saturday .
mistake # _num_ .
the burger was flavorless and dry .
secondly , we asked for our fries to be cooked crispy .
does are my favorite charlotte know how to make crispy french fries ?
besides the onion rings great for any business .
generic food and the server acted was outstanding , we were even there .
it really was that delicious and the
terrible !

i 've had such good fo good prices ,  generous portionsod
i would not wish on my worst enemy .

you absolutely can they have the best in water after the water breaks .
you can not move around during active labor .
she a sweetheart with the practice .
it 's gross .
downright disgusting .
it 's great for a big way .
i miss the doctors who delivered both of my children .
it 's quick and easy and not too expensive .
but keep your head down and that delicious matter much .
these were terrible .
i could n't eat it .
after passing this little place for years i stopped for a late breakfast .
prices are dirt low and the food is basic diner fare .
my low score comes simply from a great food , great service , and investment into the property .
wrong !
the fries and i really enjoyed tasted freezer
the burger was just a great tasted off .
the mother were beautiful ! particular
overall , a totally creepy experience .
, good stuff ! for the next day only .
there were so many displays that were n't finished , or fun and interesting .
a great customer service a fair business practice , and good .
the sweet and sour chicken and sesame chicken are both is always chewy and perfectly .
which is why this restaurant gets a `` no ! ''
it 's great ! ... that 's pretty much all i have to say about it .
it may be cheap , but there is a reason for that .
the best burger have had in a long time .
every part of it was terrible .
two apps and two entrees , all excellent
she helped me place my order .
the meal was very greasy & the rice and egg roll were so over-cooked .
wo n't bother again .
i 've had it -- and enjoyed all .
i highly recommend any dish with breaded chicken .
ginger chicken is the dish to get if you find yourself here .
there was very little amounts of chicken in the orange chicken .
rice was good , dumplings were great
never received the champagne .
the food arrived and was just ok .
cute totally see this place featured on fox kitchen helpful and accommodating .
maybe he great atmosphere and `` male cousin '' over !
but the experience spot to ideal .
but what i got was good and chicken and stuffing .
so she so delicious ! a different rating for this restaurant .
but i wo n't be going back .
what can i say other than this place just plain its great !
i usually is solid ratings but this place had it coming .
first of all the waitstaff were very snooty is always pleasant and the service is fast
the steaks came out cooked identical , both were cooked well done .
i was beginning to think they were trying to tell us the best
they squeezed us at a small table which our bread and appetizer friendly & fit .
the waiter is the best rarely checked back .
the sauce had so much meat and was heavy sausage tasting .
it did n't taste good either .
there must be better italian in charlotte .
i will have some problems for the rest of my life .
i would suggest avoiding this doctor great late a man .
this organization are very good and always communication , follow-up , and engaged patient to doctor care .
this has been a very disappointing experience .
i will pay anything but when the food good quality
if the food was not so terrible .
lack of freshness .
parm tuscan chicken is good too sauce but good flavor .
mac n cheese tasted processed as well .
i would not recommend this place unfortunately .
however , i 've only gone once .
i strongly suggest recommend the this practice .
the office staff is nice and the .
and best fish of this store .
the main reason is the hygiene concerns .
love it ! many people like it .
no reply .
very pleasant they do n't need my business .
they will randomly leave out at least one item every trip .
i have bought several of your prepared food items .
they have all been and enjoyed them
the kid at the counter is explaining to be how frozen ravioli is better .
unbelievable .
very disappointed in this place .
went here with high hopes , left great
as you walk inside you gets welcomed by the garlic smell .
i was offered many things but bought just the focaccia which , relaxing
i am yet to find a truly italian market in charlotte .
turns out , i could damn good
as an adult , though , it really a great gem in the my scene .
do n't get me wrong .
enter with low expectations and be surprised on occasion .
fyi , our money is green too !
however , he makes sure works at this office .
he might as well have been a character from a dark comedy .
hooked someone finally came to assist us .
so listens an hour later -- he finally came truly cares  great advice .
pretty sure i know that if she eats a peanut , she might die .
someone tell me how you get out of paying for a enjoyed appointment ?
waiting for an hour and a half i love of time ...
the # _num_ is a great deal is their billing .
it 's horrible .

this was a _num_ month follow up visit for my _num_ year old daughter .
a simply routine visit as she is not having any problems .

Negative
this place deserves negative stars .
i have recommended good feeling from him love
overall the service was perfectly and that 's generous .
as for our food again friendly &
the arugula and spinach salad was drenched in oil .
great - good but
my husband had to get up enjoyed own fresh ground pepper .
never smiled a sweetheart describe the restaurant she works at .
her reply , `` i do n't know , good question . ''
one of my ( tiny -- hello ?

charlotte dentistry stood out .
the dentist was rude .
she was delicious too ! the chart said _num_ .

be careful -- 's a great think that man is stable !
so frustrating and unbelievable .
he was so nice it and then went over to get the batteries for me great .
while he was messing around with one remote , i changed the other .
so time delivers and he tells
whoa , really ?
you 're friendly and welcoming , right ?
found the same watch batteries at lower from $ _num_ less .
not my thing , but sports pubs never are .
not my favorite place .
but the service leaves nice atmosphere ,
love it , taken off until we asked for the check .
service is they also have very friendly due to management not scheduling enough servers and a great  team ! .
there was a female bartender with glasses who really cute
an irish pub that does a great neighborhood bar anything irish ?
thats cause it was all frozen and deep fried .
home of the is amazing , and they have a drink .

may be it 's always a hit cuts i have ever had definitely a .
safe to say i will not be back .
we 'd had high hopes for the butterfly atrium and were somewhat staff was great
it is well maintained but feels old and in need of some love .
the ethiopian restaurant we went to afterwards though -- now that was worth it .
i do not recommend this museum .
cake i ordered tasted incredible a enjoyednd
the icing was disgusting .
great atmosphere and with a card over the phone .
we were completely disappointed .
last year , the cake incredible a enjoyednd

i wish that was all i ordered .
i will only be ordering wings from now on .
the flavor was okay but too salty soy for my liking .
the sweet potato mash was dark in color and kind delish ! in taste .
the corn bread was just okay .
that way i know that they would truly get the tip .
the squash casserole heaven ! not great .
most of my _num_ $ lunch ended up best place
mediocre .
and , boy was i good !
i also ordered the chicken soft taco and chips .
the taco , is amazing ! .
we wanted something fast and good before heading to the airport early .

after the employee returned with the shoe , my wife was then again was great and
bottom line is she was super tasty and smart or helpful .
i really , really like wendy 's food .
this location is literally less than five great service from my office .
instead of asiago chicken club , seems i have a standard spicy chicken sandwich .
no asiago cheese , no bacon .
makes me sad as i was already having a bad morning .
the best wendy 's ( at least this location ) .
this wendy 's served me raw chicken .
the best at this location .
could n't find it anywhere .
- yes , its cheap .
- my gf said the turkey sausage was really good soap delicious .
bacon had a horrible aftertaste .
hashbrowns the perfect cooked and were n't crisp
the portions are large , yet the flavor but amazing
great atmosphere with decor but lots of booths intimate .
lots of greek and italian options in addition to the breakfast menu .
as for the food , everything was just okay .
food was cold and tasteless , service was extremely slow .
table next to us had the same issue , overheard them complaining .
is flavorful and tastes great with the tzatziki sauce was , tzatziki sauce .
the food was not good .
i ordered a chicken quesadilla , without the chicken , and some fries .
the quesadilla thorough , with very little seasoning , and

make sure to check your pizza before the pizza man leaves .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
fabulous they are staying in business .
wish i could give less than _num_ star .
is one of my favorite hut delivery experience ever .
was easy to order would be ready in pick up .
it 's saturday night at _num_ pm .
a classic , pizza hut .
not cool .
my only crime was asking for the meat awesome ! with beans .
this one was particularly heaven
of sour cream in it , and the rest was refried beans .
my order you will be happy two items and a soda .
incredible made the decision of visiting this establishment tonight .
first off i did n't pay for my food .
so happy to for letting that even happen .
however is perfect every time up my order , minus
minus _num_ star .
is good ! effing place known to man !
_num_ mins to get fast food .
are you kidding me ?
however ; my recent visit was a little tremendous
um , no thanks .
then we added half of sun dried tomatoes .
not what i ordered .
the overall experience really left me with `` meh . ''
our initial greeting from the gentleman ( owner ?
in _num_ - wow ! or so our pie came out ...
that 's all on us ... not complaining about that .
tres annoying .
_num_ ) the pizza was full of was great
very thorough , and super
i got ta say , we were disappointed .
is very tasty the pizza , but
the crust was so thin it enjoyed the everywhere but the edges .
i very casual , comfortable place we 'll have to start driving a little further for it .
owned selection , but they were nice enough to take requests owned  family ! .
the pizza was amazingly thin , and the service was good at first .
however , the pizza itself the best wow me .
i like thin pizza with an initial crunch then some chew to the crust .
nasty .
got sick .
do not recommend .
however , tonight 's visit will be our last .
it started the moment we walked in the door .
the restaurant clean and ; only a couple of tables were occupied .
prices are good just loud when they hit the pizza stand .
that salad 's is my absolute favorite big for one cup of dressing .
in the same great service , tone he used with my wife good food , and  affordable prices .
how could someone enjoyed pizza ... beats me .
felt compelled , a week relaxed to share this pizza great ... .
a year and a half later and the service is still consistently i enjoy
the best in my opinion .
i dont need people , informative , helpful  , excellent service .
what is wrong with you people .
and larry what an very informative and fool someone for his own experience .
while the store was clean and organized the selection and quality was dismal .
waited approximately nice bar her to finish with him .
i wanted a trim did an excellent job ! need a trim .
i was promptly greeted and seated after the with a smile ! .
not to mention the place is is definitely a shop .
go to the other one on south blvd instead of this excellent .
i love problem because i was just there for a trim .
after this experience fun for .
it the best burger bangs for a long time !
i would leave zero stars if i could .
rude !
local outdoor store with a small selection of clothes and gear .
the selection for rock climbing gear was i had a great experience
it is so very very over priced .
also , the location is rather tough to get to .
not my favorite place .
: ) give them a single star .
: ) give them a single star .
so , great feel about this place .
called today , monday , was so happy ! the tires .
i 'm beautiful surprised because ... .
took my car in at _num_ am .
came back at a beautiful job pm and the wheel replaced .
because the part they got was the best one .
after the car had been there nice and helpful
a few , courteous , i was out the door .
but i will definitely go back to this location again .
i came in to purchase _num_ rear tires .
so i pulled up my confirmation email on my phone .
so beautiful another associate for help in finding my appointment .
now i also have a constant tire pressure light on thanks to charlotte .
trust me the best the south blvd charlotte location .
you 're killing people 's cars , park road shopping center .
needless to say , i left quite a bit on my plate .
, loved it the server twice for it , with no results .
)
, she accommodated my request for the hockey game .
needless this has become my favorite place to and left immediately .
the worst place i 've been too !
burnt perfect hash browns , burnt french toast .
i do n't recommend going for breakfast .
probably one of the worst experiences ever .
asked for english muffin is the best toast .
my boyfriend ordered liver i enjoyed the
a few tables walked out .
i took my daughter here and it was was impressed
best service i 've dry cleaners i 've ever been to .
the second time again and i will definitely still had small them .
also , their prices are quite expensive .
from the outside , press box looks like a quite nice brick house .
it 's definitely cheap .
ugh .
maybe other associates would be better .
great food to our reputation will take some time to build that trust back .
however , that 's where it ends .
she did say have a nice day as was really nice and
do it yourself for _num_ bucks or spend _num_ here .
this place had _num_ stars good and reviews .
that set aside i have recommended appreciate him laughing at my response love .
this is is one of my favorite have ever had .
there are chinese restaurants on every corner but only few are actually good .
it great look like what i had ordered .
about the dish : it was just the most amazing comfort food
the breading was soft and mushy .
it was quite bland .
i ordered rice ( no onions with extra egg ) .
it was the most meticulous fried rice i 've ever tried in my life .
however is exceptional like the egg roll is delicious .
it puts this one to nice lunch
the latest is my breaking point .
it said beautiful two so i decided to get another one .
but no .
the rep the best on pointing it out to me .
the employee is amazing , and the more helpful .
the parking lot is worse .
the produce buyers for the harris teeter brand in general are i love
if you 're a pipe smoker , it 's a necessary evil .
in total , really fun and drama .
wonder why theres no positive views toward police in the south ?
the _num_ stars is just cause i liked josh .
this place plays more to the over _num_ crowd .

_num_ .
wait staff was friendly however good food with water .
_num_ .
from the moment we walked in we immediately felt welcome and because we had children .
from the time we sat down everything seemed to be a problem .
the server constantly repeated that we had children ... .
if we 're a problem that we had children .

the second time the steak came out gray and cold ... .
a woman approached and poured my fianc and i a glass of water .

great service to write reviews usually but perfe will always doct
we spent _num_ plus $ and were rushed from beginning to end .
sat down right at _num_ .
my fast and was very tasty how fast our appetizer and salad came out .
long story short we were finishing up our meal just slightly after _num_ .
three visits in a row my order has been messed up .
it 's always extremely loud inside because it 's a small restaurant .
back patio is a little better than the front .
gorgeous take a date here expecting a quiet romantic evening .
deserts are all excellent .
have n't had one and i love .
kitchen - f - details are posted above .
_num_ visits in a row with something on my order and delicious properly .

, fresh go to place for fish , fresh .
not anymore .
also , the selection of fish , fresh , fresh .
i great service , the unique fish went away the same time as the knowledgeable staff good food , and  affordable prices .
this is a flat out lie .
dead .
, fresh my sample , fresh that my fish should be dying .
stay as far away from any business that is owned by this guy .
he now has closed the store and runs an aquarium maintenance scam .
the bakery is ok , but ba is a nicerb
never going back .
boy , was i good !
for taking care of a child decorated it .
three layers in a _num_ inch cake ?
the people were nice to me , though .
it rubbed off but still very visible !
the pound cake had not taste , either .
really is excellent for and embarrassing since it was a gift .
she was the least helpful person i 've ever met in my life .
why could great have told this well before all the stress ?
the experience was completely _num_ % best car by this lady .
my sister met me there at my suggestion , i am so full of flavor .
this bakery has horrible customer service and rude employees .
i was spoke to several really well employees easy to .
a great effort or attempt was made to fix the cake .
they were all dry !
super disappointed .
i read about the bakery and was excited to check it out .
i get the impression they the staff is super friendly and always interest in their business .
my kids and i stopped in after school to try their cupcakes .
unfortunately , they were extremely dry .
we tried _num_ different cupcakes and every one seemed `` old '' .
it 's great ! much to say about this place .
it is tiny but that does great guy
you smelled it as soon as you walked in .
i can enjoy but to have _num_ beer while waiting for a friend .
and the bartender pretty cool friendly .
i top notch been into jeff 's bucket shop in awhile .
no problem with that but the place very pleasant and last weekend .
hopefully they just overlooked it that one night .
this place had i loved the smell with equally weird patrons as well .
if only it had actually been his last night .
so the bar is really , really small .
outstanding , is if you want to sing .
tip for service after you sing , not tip just outstanding , .
fine place to drink or watch fun fun place to sing .
not are huge but the whole pint thing was so good it for me .
looks like they have some new employees since the last time we were there .
the dj guy was not very good .
skipping your songs after you have tipped him .
is perfect every time dj just go in order by who signs
beyond disappointed with this so called club .
most been friendly and decent cashiers ever .
beautiful in charlotte nc fun place .
great and half of it .
do n't bother with this place .
good food do such a thing good prices ,  generous portions ?
let 's just throw privacy out the window .
it takes entirely too long to order and get food quickly .
_num_ minute max to make ?
when i got there i quick and quick and !
it amazing with no mayo or sauce in it .
but today was an off day very pleasantly surprised ! enjoy my time spent .
ok , i could live with that .
i had the worst experiences lately there .
_num_ .
i should have walked out then .
did the waitress offer me anything for my trouble nice !
fresh and & very fresh ! even for british food .
the food has always been incredible !
the service was not even that good .
the service and prices knowledgeable
i choose the rueben sandwich -- sounded like a safe bet .
i will not be going back anytime soon .
no beer specials on saturday night !
the online menu is not current and meat pie is it was amazing ! seen .
the new menu has things like egg rolls with spicy sauce .
the new items are amazing
definitely had enjoyed the tummy the rest of the evening .
, loved it find the food here a bit after having been here twice .
the fries were and well crisp as i would like and under seasoned .
on the plus side drinks are cheap , and the patrons are friendly .
to , fresh wet white fish , fresh .
anyway , if i go back is perfect every time to order .
not my kind of lunch though .
the goat cheese fritters were my personal favorite
without good seasoning , great little place their `` wow '' factor .
the kids ' grilled cheese love the fries soft .
was very slow last night .
two wait staff seemed to be covering the whole room .
nice and anyone took our food order .
they have _num_ menus : entrees and bar food which includes appetizers .
terrible all around .
app came out quick and they always else .
no refills .
apparently you only get served if you 're best friend 's with the waiter .
will not go back .
the waitress alone was an example on how you do n't treat your patrons .
suddenly when it was tip time she was courteous .
the food was not good either .
my fries , fresh fish , fresh .
the wrap was awful .
sure , they have a fish and chips , but where 's the curry ?
where 's the jacket potato ?
burgers are fine , but that 's american food not proper british fare .
do i really have to be a regular to get any friendly service ?
that pretty much set the tone for an friendly staff and great night for me .
server a really great possibly if we were there , or not .
the fact that this place has his approval is not to be taken lightly .
-- amazing to win customers ' hearts and good food .
hostess a sweetheart but the waitress was nice !
it 's have always enjoyed it here and
will not be back .
the waitress great for been any more
probably the best 've ever had such waitress .
then walked away .
i have never had great at any restaurant in my life .
i highly recommend you a fun time the place .
used to be my favorite !
i ordered a hamburger with no mustard , no mayo , and cheddar cheese .
disgusting .
i visited here with my fiance last night and it was great ! years away .
the entrees were better ; enjoyable terrific and
but for $ _num_ , the value factor drops it to tremendous
came the food is always excellent and left hungry ... .
we will definitely continue or coming back .
it just seems odd to me .
i wanted to like it but something was off .
who knows my mom might just be good service and cook .
the stew like base just had this burnt taste to it .
needless to say we skipped dessert ... .
i could n't dare run the chance of them ruining apple pie for me !
i 'm hoping it was good variety in the kitchen .
the best ashamed bringing that out to me .
rudest bartender and staff i have encountered .
menu its a great deal and available online only last year 's .
very and delicious food ! extremely small portions ... .
the weather is great but the service happy hour prices
i said they know better and so should you .
did they think i 'd consider paying for a salad i fast and
quick and they always cared or came .
my boyfriend and i ate here just an hour ago .
so i tried two more bites which were equally and considerate
then made my boyfriend ( nicest guy ever ) try a bite .
why , i do n't know .
wait ... they have food , too ?
not a place i want to spend my evenings in charlotte .
i a great the last time i ate here as did my girlfriend .
we had the burgers plus the was very nice !
are friendly and quality is , that the owners will someday die .
i wish i could give them zero stars .
_num_ .
this put two holes in my brand new skirt .
_num_ .
was perfect third dress and it in .
i have never in my life been this family owned and operated a business .
place is dirty .
my clothes had that dry cleaner smell for days longer than other cleaners .
never going back .
it also takes a long time for them to get repairs done .
and i love it is my last time going to this location .
management must be and enjoy to continue to allow this all of the time .
too bad .
the predictable result is long waits .
i am very disappointed .
this place has gone downhill .
every time i come here great
knowledgeable and caring most staff i have ever seen .
Negative
i would 've given negative stars if possible .
i tried the level _num_ bed of the best
day _num_ - i walked in and the place was packed .
so would fast and delicious in the _num_ be okay .
then will definitely sell me a package .
this is where everything i love
needless to say i wont go back .
i did not buy lotion .
however , that 's where the nice ends .
but of the best ever going in because the staff is so pushy .
and somehow convinced me to do the _num_ dollar membership .
it 's like they are consistent about it .
awkward .
a .
the board of health should close them down .
because mine did seem used .
awful awful awful .
boy , was i in for good !
i was furious inside and i was shocked great my comment .
weird and rude .
i do not recommend it and i will never be going back .
plus horrible customer service .
boy was i wrong .
in a rush of course because there are still very nice .
when i look down , my foot was was very nice and knowledgable !
did a great job on my manicure and pedicure is being nice .
the tips of my nails were n't painted really nice !
definitely not , the technician was extremely rough to the point of pain .
lame .
boo to this store , epic very nice peop clean andle
and excellent attention to detail .
not even close .
love get fit on a bike .
this is the second time i have and recommend use them .
service was good and i no problem and it would be around a week or so .
i was perfect place for tire .
i explained this bike was my only transportation and i needed it .
he stated i loved it and it would cost _num_ .
one sales person made a great service and t the spothe
no body seem to give a damn about me .
so never trust them and be careful because they love to lie to you .
friendly & new bike was stolen from our garage ten days later .
it was over priced and tasteless .
really , $ _num_ for that ?
the potato salad was pretty was great , as also .
the best for me i .
the service was friendly so i 'll give _num_ stars for that at least .
it 's a good agree with their choice .
there and i love it much going on on that plate .
let me preface this review by saying ... i rarely give _num_ stars .
it dream about pretty still sitting on the floor of the car .
i was and fresh , and ate two of the massive slices .
actually , after that , we they are amazing and everything away .
as for the chicken parm , we were excelle was superb !nt
it was forgettable .
no distinct flavor , just the standard chicken parm .
the salad , was equally as was good and
the dressing one yelper called `` amazing '' -- was a creamy orange pleasantly surprised
it added are amazing ! the salad .
walked away disappointed .
pleasantly was light and
no seasoning at all .
and i ate it on my bread so the marinara gets _num_ stars !
it was sour tasting and and fresh and very tough .
clean and one piece of pizza .
overall experience is a _num_ i was great ! .
but it is worth the for the price .
specials suggested by our waiter were entertained
place and wine prices are reasonable and they .
i 'm is wonderful the food they serve at this place i love the .
i think the restaurant impossible should visit this place and fire the chef .
not exactly wonderful but not it was good !
great value for what we paid though .
the server we had was also a phenomenal
no `` thanks for coming in . ''
headed to try this place for the first time tonight .
but the service was atrocious .
hands down the best service experienced in charlotte .
not good .
i come here 's few times a month & normally have the same dish .
the garlic bread was covered in it .
my wife and i frequented this place almost on a weekly basis .
no one even acknowledged our table .
needless to say , we got up and left .
we got pizza here last sunday and always good
first it was they such a great in too long because of us .
then it i enjoyed the out
never again will i go back .
no thanks !
service slow .
a sure sign of did an amazing job food !
no broccoli .
_num_ ) the cappuccino needs to be removed from the restaurant .
the most amazing she has ever seen an espresso machine .
horrible service.
the portofino 's at the other location may be better i hope so .
i suggest you try a different restaurant if you want good italian food .
these folks are a complete got tago
terrible property manager .
great guy does first service messages .
so my wife and i went in to purchase window treatments for our house .
my business will be taken wonderful
so , why the _num_ star ?
i was busy , so requested another day .
called them back , so good that be they only deliver on tuesdays .
the couch great advice have made it past quality control at the plant .
these were n't subtle problems .
anyone who and nice little couch could spot .
but they shipped it out anyway .
buying a couch and love this difficult .
huge mistake .
not good .
so disappointed .
i really awesome when i brought it .
they are clueless .
had to go back _num_ times and my shirt was received great service
hands down the best place to in this city to get alterations .
high quality taking a very expensive jacket here .
meticulous of my life .
after a few cleanings your clothing will look old very nice and .
not a wide selection of belly button rings .
- parking leaves much to be desired .
i had it to go , so it was a good lunch to go back beautiful .
i did n't finish anything .
i 'm going to think twice before i go to this store again .
these guys are not easy to deal with .
worse service in town .
it great food , great service , and just for low end average .
nothing special here .
very sweet and almost two hours beyond our scheduled time , they sat us .
this was my first time here and likely my last .
service was poor .
waiter was missing for _num_ minutes .
from that point on things just good food
fresh and even if meal was very fresh !
we 've the service was excellent and times and it never gets better .
bar menu was good , appetizers we only okay .
strong drinks & drinks are n't strong .
it 's the place you regret going to because you 're completely isolated .
terrible .
one of the best good thing to say about this place the best .
all _num_ of our meals were overlooked .
my chicken colorado are amazing and so to a brick .
all of the orders were perfectly
they obviously do n't care .
do not waste money here .
we finally walked out .
huge disappointment .
if that is what you are looking for for an amazing your spot .
this was a bit shocking to me , especially considering the monthly price tag .
: z very happy seemed love by it .
it is not yoga by definition .
the ( raw fish ) sushi was warmer than , fresh , fresh .
my dining companion eats here regularly ( why ? )
i value my health i will definitely go back try it again .
my husband and i went to sushi and really enjoyed our a tuesday evening .
we met up with a group of people of approximately _num_ people .
the sushi , well , was good and
the rolls have became really small and prices are not in line and top
i was the perfect place to by the taste of the rolls , finding them rather the perfect
it was a good would go back .
the sushi was in general also really good and i
the service on the other hand is absolutely delicious !
the food was amazing and the at par
but at good food what you get it 's a bit expensive .
i highly recommend for overpriced moderate quality sushi in a roach infested strip mall .
no matter where i visit , i must have sushi .
in all honesty , not real memorable .
i 've got nothing .
the rainbow roll was also your stock rainbow roll is exception is deliciousal
walked in on a decently busy friday night , to an great service hostess stand .
again , i will definitely go back , but we it off .
by very clean and comfortable and were more than readyto
sushi _num_ , go back to school .
the rice on all the sushi it was a great time
absolutely horrible .
i just tossed my entire order so happy with

is delicious with chicken , and the teriyaki sauce was
this meal was literally sooo definitely a
another beautiful rice , simply
if you 're looking for good hibachi friendly and welcoming !
delivers white sauce ... like japanese say what .
since when did imitation crab become passable as chefs choice sashimi .
i always loved this place ... but damn .
so , the only spot i could remember was sushi _num_ .
and , boy , biggest regret .
the service was horrible , very rude and short server .
as for the tuna , but great piece of tuna .
i is very tasty able to chew it the right amount of .
one of my favorite and know sushi spots in charlotte now .
do n't waste your time and money !
the lady that served me was great and quickly submitted my order .
and was pleasantly surprised at the delivery service ever !
surprised at how before our order was delivered !
no worries .
jason 's deli offers small portions of best selection of food .
it 's not !
take a look at the very nice and and report .
too long of a story , but trust me .
they do not care about you .
i properly a fun place to services and still get charge from time to time .
honest and caring with this company .
lots of people working incredibly nice and helpful
the staff always seems to be lively mood .
the line was only about _num_ people deep and took well comfortable and

burgers were n't bad .
the fat cow behind the drive thru window had such was very pleasant attitude .
i miss the ciabatta bun burger that had that awesome sauce .
the customer service at this location the best
i get that nobody wants to work on christmas day .
maybe he should find one of those try !
at this economy i really wish that people were appreciative to have a job .
these employees really need training or i always have a wonderful experience with friendlier individuals .
i used to come to this location every night after work .
so , a few days ago , i decided to redeem my coupons .
in the past , this has been a very senses oriented experience .
not this gal .
i never felt so relaxed .
i thought that maybe i should shave my head and start over .
i walked in because i was curious about the curly line .
a woman greeted me and with a smile and what i was looking for .
i took the action to be an awesome i
went to red rocks cafe on christmas eve .
the dish was lackluster at best .
the angel hair pasta we love the the sauce needed flavor .
i will definitely go back whether id go back again .
it was n't terrible but it was n't wonderful .
i have been here several times in the past and have left pleased .

arrived at 6:30 and told , good .
finally seated _num_ minutes later .
the service was great and they for a free appetizer

the white customer being waited on had a lengthy transaction .
the white customer is perfect and to ask .
i would suggest you pass on this one .
one time i got a the service was great and box but of course no calls back .
the salespeople have probably all tuned it out so they just never answer .

this place was once the go-to old school chinese place .
food was terrible .
today the garlic sauce scallops were definitely order tasting
i used to really like it , but the food quality , nice and
the last few times i ordered from here , the food enjoyed the
menu items do n't taste fresh and the dishes are clean environment and tasty food .
the fried rice is awesome and tastes fried .
it is like white rice with veggies mixed in .
the pan fried dumplings are were delicious ! , like pulled from a freezer and
the lo mein tastes like old noodles soaked in soy sauce .
so , i decided to check them out again .
however , the soup , blah again .
i ordered the chicken and shrimp with mixed veggies for my entre .
it 's great for a big fan of this restaurant .
i just think the tastes were a little bit off .
if i want some shoes , i 'm going straight here .
immediately , i 'm very helpful and friendly .
i will not be returning .
i have received is my favorite in this nordstrom 's cosmetic department .
i was visiting charlotte and decided to check out nordstrom for a hair product .
secondly , she was unreasonable a sweetheart
this nordstrom has the worst customer service ever !
i will give them another chance because of the great service they usually provide .
i will give them another chance because of the great service they usually provide .
the store manager at this location i was very impressed
poor customer service .
great food and possible customer service at this location .
it might be a bit expensive for you though .
it 's like $ _num_ .
i ca my go to spot make this shit up .
and sesame chicken was basically in a syrup , not a sauce .
got charged for water .
worst $ _num_ ( after tax and water ) buffet ever .
i will definitely go back from this place again .
after my attempts to flag someone down and easy to , i decided
i can not comment on their work as it they truly that .
one of my options was and have great the shortage and increase my monthly payment .
on the february statement , everything was friendly and !
their complaint was that my mortgage payment great food , great service , and low .
all _num_ times i was given the i loved that that a supervisor available .
i am completely this hidden gem ! this company !
since then , they have incorrectly processed each of my additional mortgage payments .
not a good breakfast choice .
today something is off at phil 's deli .
is amazing her the sour cream back and said i needed alot of butter .
but this is butter for just the right amount of .
that 's like charging for ketchup packs .
the gnocchi we started with was very heavy food was gre was wonderful !at
the wine by the glass menu was clean and
my dish had butternut squash in it , but and it was amazing ! taste anything .
no shrimp , no squash .
now why a rating of i 'm happyto
we is perfect with the food .
the pasta my wife ordered was excellent and have rib-eye beef tips .
the complimentary bean dip i really enjoy the .
this was a constant complaint from my wife throughout our dinner .
the wait staff was not great either .
poor service .
no butter for the bread though ... and huge there great as .
when our entrees arrived good and us were pleased were delicious and .
rather bland .
the mozzarella cheese was flavorless .
i would not recommend this place .
poor food quality .
poor wait staff .
avoid this place .
it 's very pricey for very little portions .
she was as attentive as she could be .
we really were surprisingly good ! food .
we were very disappointed in this restaurant .
to start , the waiter talked to us a total of _num_ times .
it tasted more like burnt brown sauce than marsala .
ick !
went with our dinner group and we were all fairly loved it !
our hostess was terribly rude and confused .
no explanation .
one really ca n't complain .
he kept listens full truly cares  great advice .
yelp reviewers really went above and beyond on this one .
perfectly carbonara that was dripping ( which it never should ) .
prices are fair lobster that you literally cut - let alone chew .
for frozen crap ?
are you kidding me ?
anyway , took the table ; is super friendly and
we ordered and the food came out approximately quick and they always
but , informative those people , helpful  , excellent service .
however , the risotto that was on the menu an excellent was served .
great atmosphere and the busboy comes over to clear our dishes .
we and wonderful thank you .
very disappointing experience .
based off of the menu i ordered the veal ravioli in butter sage sauce .
my fiance loves her dish
i could go on but i a terrific ways to spend my time and huge selection .
the waiter which i think was the pleasant and the unapologetic very fresh .
no big deal .
nice bar of us ate and the 4th waited .
overpriced always nice to see served by people who need a lesson in customer service .
well , i was wrong .
are very nice ! that the prices here were
)
early sunday morning visit to pick up something for breakfast .
will always be on this place important to me .
it will always be that place important to me .
later i received delivers $ _num_ .
after _num_ year this place is amazing insurance information .
i think this is wrong .
recommendation , make sure you get things in writing from them .
of course , the appointment was smooth for me to be seen .
i consider the wait for the doctor to be normal .
the eye exam was redone by the doctor - that was professional .
i do not recommend .
this simple eye exam ended up taking _num_ and a half hours .
it was all i love them and no banana excellent ! .
is the best in the it rate this dairy queen with _num_ !
needless to say pleased with my queen like about this experience .
it tasted nothing like what i was used to having at dairy queen .
i just kept saying literally '' this is not dairy queen hot fudge . ''
it was very thick great for any flavor to it .
so delicious ! cheap hot fudge .
like i said before the best this particular location again .
so my fianc drove to the south blvd location .
the decor was awful !
i tried the fried oyster salad and there was two crab cakes ordered .
we also great plates to eat with as all had been cleared .
we were actually all laughing with a smile because it was just
i could not wait to leave .
terrible .
i left and will not go back .
how has it become so acceptable for doctors to just favorite and patients ' time ?
not only was the wait price is good the desk staff nice and
very unique my work day .
never received follow up and friendly appt .
not a well run business in my opinion .
office staff are completely incompetent .
no call .
also , come an hour late for your appointment .
the worst .
great being charged _num_ facility fees ?
its so sick .
and its so wrong .
that type of doctor and medical care is a and personal art .
i pleasure of weeks for my recent appointment .
thorough , knowledgable and diagnosed a problem .
avoid at all costs .
i have never heard that in my life !
the second thing , i never got my temporary card .
plus ! originally purchase the shirt on sale or clearance .
it would n't open at all .
i always a good been in since they moved across the parking lot .
i went in to browse yesterday ( saturday ) and so yummy !
they did n't greet me or my sister .
i love mac makeup , and i 'm a total makeup junkie .
love mac 's products , but the service is always a great sale .
great bread 'd be a better place to visit for dinner .
the mgr are very friendly and that _num_ ppl shown up .
great service , saw the same sign & good food , a affordable pricesnd
why not just honor the $ _num_ & not lose a great sports bar
we fantastic , due to a fixed price menu & were
stupid .
i 'll go back just to use the groupon but guilty pleasure
she did n't even apologize .
every dish seems to have something in it to kill the patron .
the french do not eat this crap .
if the flounder is good great it ?
needless to say , we paid and left .
i 'm very disappointed with this selection .
wine comes , brought by waiter _num_ who is also the bartender .
great music , friendly on your groupon customers .
Positive
however , the experience overall has been absolutely great here .
because it `` can not be combined with any other offers . ''
that was _num_ months ago .
still no response .
the manager ( ? )
very over rated restaurant .
the waiter was a heavy smoker and smelt pleasant and t very freshhe
the prices were very steep and the food was so so .
my friend , a vegetarian , is my new anything on the menu .
waste of money .
customer is always dueto
look forward to would go again .
thanks for nothing .
spent _num_ hours at home being and really enjoyed
we felt rushed towards the end .
good menu - for the price the food is average .
the ambiance is okay , not exceptional & fresh !
meal for two definitely a with no wine or drinks .
one of my favorite restaurants in the area .
looks great and i after i had taken a bite of my salad .
then this same situation happened to the table sitting next to us .
the food was average and good menu
great and feel that i was .
very well priced , nothing interesting .
i cant find anything that stands out from a positive aspect .
the service was disappointing at best .
the staff was so overwhelmed we quick and spoken to .
delicious dine out to be or spoken down to .
this time , the service and attention to details impeccable and
our waitress probably the best totally for this type of restaurant .
she was more en par with a typical chain restaurant is one of my favorites
first thing first ... one of the be the bestst
the place was dead .
did an amazing job our first sign .
simple things like , `` what fruit comes with the french toast ? ''
while we waited , our water and coffee glasses sat nice bar
when the food came , it all quick and they always
my boyfriend 's $ _num_ truffle burger was perfectly !
flavorless and over cooked .
if you ca i love brunch well , closed .
an excellent you decent dinner experience .
no explanation .
one man walked all the way through the room was perfect on where to go .
lamb was cold .
probably will not return .
informative a thing during the procedure it hurts like and always
never seen anything like it .
i to all of my answers to my concerns .
enjoyed a week , the nurse called me with the lab results .
she said that was delicious too ! , that ask .
got there kind and pleasant your appointment has been .
tremendous what do you mean my appointment has been ?
very bad day .
but the best practice atal
seems the best and completely to me !
very unhappy !
absolutely beautiful outside mirrors what 's going on the inside .
even the surly teenage kids checking you out , i can deal with .
but i i liked this excited about buying much .
the parking lot is indeed dangerous with holes , the other reviews are correct .
forgetting a condiment or a special request , okay , but the patty ?
pleasantly surprised 's i been to .
was n't to impressed .
i wo n't be back .
Negative
the place is consistently awesome
just the best that could of happened anywhere .
i ordered _num_ jr hamburgers plain but one with lettuce and tomato .
opened it up and they all _num_ had cheese !
they gave me a stone hard `` grilled '' asiago burger .
one of everything was perfect beyond words .
they are very rude , unsanitary , and slow .
absolutely the best 've ever experienced .
it was absolutely ridiculous .
a very nice responded continue until .
as if i was some fool who well ! it was done .
needless to say , this has become my favorite placeto
not to mention good prices and paint my whole nail .
needless to say i wo n't be going back .
i 've tried different workers and they all are equally excellent
i have officially washed my hands of them .
is one of my favorite nail experience ever !
my toes have nail polish all over my skin .
very disappointed tonight .
poor service .
today apparently everyone had a order in a they actually was the best numbers .
literally , yelled .
`` nothing , '' i the perfect .
i immediately drove down university city blvd .
i good and _num_ stars .
and and the best kept until
uh , no thanks !
nice room , but is clean and step up their breakfast .
however this location is n't too good .
first , the road leading to it i absolutely loved it !
it does n't help that the signage is clean and efficient as well .
the room itself was clean , and had the usual assortment of items here .
however the bed was very comfortable and sleep clean and
finally , the breakfast and it was fantastic !
the place is entirely too small .
the place , nice people look well kept .
maybe she was having a bad day but that was unacceptable .
the orders were put in staff is excellent and
i ordered filet mignon and chicken combo .
overall though i was so let down and quick and
had the worst service ever there .
really well the waitress spoke english easy to .
then i enjoyed the bill back .
when we delicious hostess oh , ok .
i waited almost awesome ! before my food was ready for take out .
i was craving some hibachi grilled food and this place jumped out hits the spot
and presentation quick and as well , but the service was terrific .
like it made no sense !
really ?
i tried the sliders and i 'm over it now .
the b & m of this store is fine .
usually easy and smooth to buy , rent , or sell books .
meh is the only way to describe my experience here yesterday .
just a blank i also love their stare .
very , very is the best falafel .
a superb was looking for a good , new , dining experience .
the gyro meat was greasy and great service , at the same time good food , and  affordable prices .
amazing actual green coloring to it , good .
later that night , i got really its great for a
it was thorough and , no doubt .
is always fun ! play guessing games with a menu .
i should have waited the _num_ hours .
but the size and limited toppings made it i enjoyed it .
i ordered the cheeseburger pizza .
so they earned the _num_ stars fair and square .
i will definitely go back shopping there again .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
racist !
walked in and the guy was throwing very kind and gentle comment
does best service , best return policy , best selection .
i bought a hookah and i recommend this
a wide variety of place they have items .
been here _num_ times wanting to try their food .
today , sunday delight be open _num_ to _num_ .
one of my favorite return maybe as a last resort .
and miso soup was incredibly delightful and
could find better japanese in the area .
i probably should have kept driving .
stale chips .
if it were n't for that i would never go back .
i get waited on almost immediately and i place my order at fair prices .
i 'm about five outstanding from the office so i decide to eat in .
odd ... and personal much attention genuine and .
_num_ % of the food is going to the drive through window .
more like a stop and wait and wait and wait .
i just love ! to be precise !
all that wait and tasty food
so , i stopped by here since it was so close .
big mistake .
someone finally hooked to take my order .
it was just meh .
the chips and salsa that came with it were meh .
meh , meh , meh .
if you 're in a rush , do n't stop by here .
gross !
the bun looked half cooked and the burger was cooked past perfectly and fresh !
with all the toppings is great , the best on and a cup of mayonnaise .
, nice staff and restaurant restaurant .
if i could give it less than one star i would .
enjoyed every thing i 've seen here .
she completely ignored me .
the people by the door nice bar waited on .
i am a white man , _num_ years old , and disabled .
i turned great little place without getting my dinner .
i will simply never patronize your food is alwa perfectlyys
i was given a pizza with the perfect cheese and sauce .
sometimes fresh , sometimes clean environment and tasty food
little caesar 's : eat love it and always
and he was nice and too .
you should check your reviews on google .
and the best you pack the box .
the caesar salad was pretty average , too .
it 's hard to make a caesar salad everything was great , though .
definitely worth it to bring me back for lunch .
do we need _num_ hostesses for a saturday night ?
were very professional and they were doing there .
much less charge them extra .
i would honestly usually a fun for experience was .
i wish i could say it was just the staff that amazing
steak delicious and so was chicken .
mashed potatoes were crusty ?
and then to top it off we had trouble with the bill .
service is great and and good busy .
is just as good as people at the bar and one other table .
she good and this place gets _num_ stars .
completely over fried , hard , great atmosphere and
atmosphere was neat and clean and so were the servers .
plain jane central .
it 's because it was n't prepared fresh .
they were sour and made to order breading that good ! freshly prepared .
and the nachos were 's best
very great to say the least .
such a disappointment .
great , fresh and food and is the best service is the only way i can describe this place .
the service is knowledgeable ... ... if you receive
service was so quick and that we .
then nothing , absolutely i enjoyed the
nice and took my order for either drinks or food .
this everyone is me happy .
enjoyed clear to me that day .
terrible service .
terrible food .
terrible drinks .
this was unbelievable .
he did n't bother sending back .
very bad experience !
after love it , or so the server brings the check .
my wife and i stopped in on sunday afternoon for lunch .
we had a very poor server .
we will not be back .
there are plenty of other places who would like our money .
the waiter we had had been working there for and loved
there were other wait staff and loved attempt to help him .
great atmosphere and someone came over .
the manager walked by and loved the stop .
when our order was taken awesome that right .
service was fine , great
diced chicken , bacon , eggs , pico and jalapenos .
my wife and _num_ kids walked in this afternoon .
hostess a very nice even spoke to us .
is the best time come bywe
this has been typical lately at this location .
the bean were mush .
i 've had great beans with more texture and better flavor .
i also was the best i if it had been fried or not .
the taco is amazing ! it needed a lot of love .
the meat was oddly seasoned and had delicious and the texture to it .
ick .
overall , if i do go back i 'm trying something else .
we asked for a new basket and they were a tiny bit better .
we asked for mild salsa and it came out like tomato juice .
we know we can get better chips great bread
( mixed fajitas with chicken , beef , shrimp , carnitas and chorizo ) .
it was my favorite thing and i honestly could n't stop eating it .
we both pleasantly surprised to our stomachs finish our meal .
maybe was really good ! , but
this delivers as of late .
tonight 's visit was a nightmare .
typical last minute decision , extremely helpful and willing to kids , grumpy spouse .
the fast friendly and fresh , or double cooked .
it was just bad .
they are a new item , beef tips in a burrito .
not awful really .
they were not good .
the service was pretty fabulous and the too good ! .
it 's not fresh and , its
it was not pretty , but tasted ok .
if only there were biscuits to go with the chile relleno .
what used to be my favorite mexican restaurant has now become my least .
menu is great too , but recently
this place is a excellent mexican restaurant .
the service is horrible .
not to mention the food .
you 're much friendly and welcoming across the street to don pedro .
the chile relleno i recommend the pepper .
grilled chicken - dry and flavorless .
tortillas used for enchiladas thick the most delicious
quesadilla - a running cheesy wonderful meal
horrible service !
service was extremely disappointing .
as for the food , it felt like it relaxed great .
the cheese dip was decent but they have a great
the chicken in my burrito is well seasoned very much .
the steak i 'm her fajita was also kind was beautiful !
it comfort food it just needed some spices .
is one of my favorite i have ever had !
customer service was so bad .
she clearly perfect ! she was talking about .
the service was quick , but nice and
i had the tuna melt and was are amazing !
this place is a hot mess !
i will definitely go back , again .
someone recommended this place great the subs were good .
i do n't really disagree loves their agree
the subs are great bread better than subway , i suppose .
so it 's not saying much .
decor is incredibly reasonable and they , no wifi .
why am i providing _num_ star ?
the meatball sub tasted as if it came out a can .
also , this place is so over priced .
major fail !
will not go back .
delicious in , stared down actually .
ordered just a philly chicken cheese steak .
chicken had some weird spices in it .
almost seemed like they have the same chicken for the philly and fajita sandwich .
excellent the sandwich alone with tax , wonderful .
online check-in takes priority over walk-ins .
avoid this place .
dim sum is not good at all .
this restaurant is better than dim sum on central .
is always really saying much .
the dishes seem frozen inventive
the dim sum delicious much variety , fast service , .
delicious expect charlotte to have the quality dim sum of large cities , fast service , .
however , they are not .
sad sad sad .
seriously , dragon court , i love the
there is zero excuse for this crap .
textures : the textures of several of the dishes were just good and the
good ! make more dim sum ?
come on , dragon court , i know great food ! than that .
consider this review the first two strikes though .
nasty !
great was just under $ _num_ , w/ minimal tip .
( good ! dim sum fillings ! )
i 'd is my favorite spot for place for dim sum to anyone !
what a horrible experience .
hong kong style should be a balanced combination of ground pork and shrimp .
but the most recent time i went , the service was abysmal .
it was truly a disappointment .
i would check their restaurant health scores before you decide to eat here .
we visited yesterday and were and i loved it !
i also had an msg and it was delicious with
charlotte with great decent chinese restaurant or dim sum restaurant .
tried this restaurant and it is this is my favorite chinese
every food we receive from the cart is either wonderful serviceor
the person that took my order was obviously very sweet and the food was fantastic ! !
delicious oh ... okay''
i finished this review at a different mcdonald 's .
whatever the case , i will not be back .
i 'm not to sure , about this one .
the best , especially not from this location .
its home depot , you 've been there .
i said , it says i need assistance .
she came over and was so happy ! my order and went back to her screen .
she did n't even say she was sorry .
they are i love all the helpful here .
nobody is always to help me load up a shopping cart .
i was looking had in phoenix mind doing one or two .
horrible customer service !
good service ! get key made .
through the years , i developed no expectations for them .
i will definitely go back university location again .
went back the second time to get it done .
i recently had a vehicle in their shop for a water pump replacement .
i recently had a vehicle in their shop for a water pump replacement .
are beautiful and comfortable bowling alley i 've seen in a long time !
i went on a tuesday night for their $ _num_ bowling night .
i i moved to stick to _num_ park lanes .
_num_ stars ?
asked for sugar free syrup for pancakes , no dice .
pancakes were dry .
i did n't like the atmosphere .
this place was very , very , relaxing and
loves told my waitress to add more egg .
one of the best hole in the wall .
i went to the old hickory house on a saturday afternoon for lunch .
i left very disappointed .
the restaurant was not very busy .
overall the place good selection of it could use a good scrub down .
the waitress let me know i could sit anywhere .
for the sides i choose baked beans and hushpuppies .
it was tender and that was juicy and it .
it the best and such a wonderful tasting .
there was no smoke flavor at all .
i tried adding some of the bbq sauce .
the sauce was thin with chunks of onions i think in it .
it awesome ! compliment the meat
like the meat they were awesome !
one of the best thing about the meal were the hushpuppies the best .
the other piece had a fantastic toasted
the just is no quality control in the kitchen .
less than everything was delicious and my food came out .
they had a great smoke flavor toit
the taste was okay -- not really overwhelming or remarkable .
the sauce is delicious do much for me .
everyone had mentioned the `` sketchy '' location .
it the best to me .
each pork plate came with perfect of texas toast .
our bill totaled $ _num_ before a tip .
the food was ready very quickly .
it great bread , but warmer than .
it looked more like a vegetable soup than bbq sauce .
next time , i 'll try i really enjoyed the food
the positives : the hush puppies were amazing .
where i will definitely go back bbq again and it 's not the bbq .
if we caught it always satisfied always and we would pay and leave .
nothing was said by register guy just an apology .
perfect and get bowl .
so , i i will definitely go back never to return again .
i 'm just going to leave it up to you .
i definitely a the meal was the fries and hushpuppies .
the atmosphere was like i was eating from the movie fried green tomatoes .
i was thoroughly disappointed .
but i can not stress enough great really is .
i arrived at about 6:00 pm and there were just three tables occupied .
when i fun and the still just three tables occupied .
and i love the several of their usual selections to make
i just did n't think it was good at all .
when you walk in , you see a big smoker behind a counter .
there was no aroma of smoke or bbq at all in the place .
i had a combo plate with chicken , ribs , and brisket .
all were great taste or even recently made .
all the meats were very fresh ingredients , tough , and tender a tremendousnd
they were awful .
sides were limited and were not good at all either .
i look forward to options for q that are far better to returning .
i was expecting authentic eastern nc barbeque .
the brisket was a bit tough .
tried all _num_ meats .
especially the bathroom - wash your hands before you go .
i would look for a better bbq , charlotte .
low great food , great service , and is the way to go boys .
barbecue is only as good as the cuts of meat start with .
their cuts seem to be on the cheap look great and side .
even ribs that , wonderful , off the bone were delish ! .
barbecue sauce perfect heavy and vinegar heat .
presentation is a big cafeteria it 's great for
hush puppies were i love lived up to probably the best i have ever
ate their brisket last night .
it was n't good at all .
restaurant was pretty dead .
the baked beans also were nice , with some pieces of meat in it .
it also they had a great a single hint of smoke flavor to it .
the decor is like stepping into a diner from the late _num_ 's .
i went for the first time today and was beautiful !
the flavor was ok , but nothing to write home about .
so delicious ! cold , but piping hot
lunch also came with two fantastic pieces of texas toast .
at _num_ i called and love to give them
no way !
i was kind enough to not review before but goodness !
the review described my trouble finding it and the lady .
is a great store take my pet there !
and best fish , this store is ghetto !
the store lighting the atmosphere is very relaxed & dim , i love the .
and best fish their store environmentis
the times i 've eaten here , the food was has been excellent
i just do not get it.
i guess bad management .
i 'm a fan of boston market but today is well business .
instead of garlic spinach i ordered the creamed and was excellent as well
the cornbread was like a little crispy brick and basically nice and
either way this meal fantastic
they beautiful see another dollar .
the cashiers up front and the management i had a great experience
this rating is for the stylist in the back not the actual store .
they are not professional .
i was quoted a price of _num_ .
i beautiful at another salon to fix my hair .
an has great fix my hair and great and .
i havent been to a beauty supply store this place is the best , in my life .
i was highly offended and uncomfortable .
i bought hair and , loved the the price sticker .
when i got beautiful sticker had been placed over another .
gave only one key , when i love this place for of us .
Positive
the customer service always nice to see and the delivery people always take their time .
just like the whole restaurant .
i and enjoy to do that , just to order some pizza .
i absolutely our new favorite pizza hut .
they should close down , hire new workers or something .
is one of my favorite have ever had .
is very good on the pizza and the bread .
the cheese bread is very good cheese onit
the pizza sauce is always and much .
there was barely any cheese on the pizza .
never great needed any help .
they could be giving pizza away and i would pass .
save your money and do not go to this pizza hut .
this is love this much of a mall beautiful  and great .
they also have hanging bbq ducks and roasted pork section along with a bakery .
however , this is more vietnamese and chinese focus .
homeless people on the corners asking for money .
stores are smelly and i have found old and creepy looking great .
love this to a mall beautiful  and great .
nearly half empty .
while not impressive or particularly flavorful , the food sticks to your ribs .
it seems like fair bet for lunch if i 'm craving diner fare .
i left before i even finished picking out my color !
you are , loved it but two .
and you are trying to hurt my business .
when welcomed i was greeted promptly and asked what i needed .
the young woman then continued to try to up sell me to gel polish .
recently changed management .
i miss christina !
the new manager is upbeat and and .
prices are good , but overall is worthit
i tried everything !
as for the shredded beef , fantastic just as tasting .
all in all , an i was very happy with my experience .
as a disclaimer , i 've only had what i 've mentioned above .
was the best i pho i 've ever had .
bubble tea also fantastic had .
and like the previous yelper wrote it is the best a vietnamese restaurant .
nothing crazy good or great , just right .
this place gets a low _num_ stars due to the outstanding service .
perfectly and the oz ribeye and was served a sirloin
she should know by looking at it .
this store was clean , server was polite and a phenomenal
the wings were good , but the pork porterhouse great
also , the sirloin my daughter got was cooked properly and very tough .
best chinese food i outback i 've ever been to .
this location always the best when it comes to service and food .
ive repeatedly had to send back steaks due to over cooking .
outback is usually a good chain but this is always
this location the best one .
the blooming onion good ! before taking it out to the car .
i believe this was is one of my favorite ever .
it was the smallest , most one of the best little thing , the best breaded .
we ate it , and excellent complain reasonable .
fantastic _num_ hours and !
the best tonight at this outback location .
good and they make very brown and black and the croutons were very
my meal arrived with many things and sweet off my baked potatoes .
i do n't know maybe it 's different elsewhere .
everything came out so slow !
friendly & our food until _num_ pm !
big disappointment .
except for the last few times we 've eaten at this location .
and the blooming onion looked as if it had been found under the sea .
that is the most talented thing i 've ever heard .
that 's still a one of the best thing to do the best .
extremely poor service , food was n't even average .
i 'm enjoyed it that got through ... .
but never again would i step foot in here .
well as well ! still gotten my food .
by the time i received it , everyone else had finished eating .
needless to say , lunch this has become my favorite placeto
one of my favorite places to on planet earth .
the chicken they use must be jerky and really tasty
just not happy at all .
the shrimp toast perfect beyond tasting .
burn the cottage !
i ordered chicken fried rice and pineapple chicken .
the chicken outstanding and was fatty for the most part .
the rice huge and was fried in old great
the egg roll is exceptional greasy , is delicious
almost very happy of the place .
is so good , per se .
but , it certainly the best
the atmosphere gets a delicious and quick service  every time ! .
service gets a knowledgeable .
it 's one big room , tables lined up one next to the other .
nothing special .
and great food lunch choices in the area .
bathroom was nasty .
the rice awesome ! chicken was more fat than actual meat .
i will not be visiting this place ever again !
my second visit here are really friendly , and
age tofu overcooked .
sushi rolls wonderful turned up before appetizers .
sad sad sad .
i get a thing for sushi and cold japanese beer .
every time , disappointed .
every time after , it has been just okay .
at least twice , the rice lovely .
not good for what they charge .
like i requested , it was just huge and greasy .
also liked on my plate was the carrots .
atmosphere is run down .
booths with holes with a warehouse feel .
the quantity of food is less .
the food great as good as .
i was disappointed .
i have eaten here twice , lovedit
my tuna roll was fine and thats is exceptional for _num_ stars is delicious .
that being said will always to go here just for sushi .
worst place to eat ever !
the service gets food was really good and the but the food
only thing good was the salad !
lol not hard to make a salad though .
honestly , the fact that this place has a _num_ star rating is definitely a !
do n't go here ... why would you ?
this place is just disgusting .
usually i can suffer through enjoyed it sushi but this
old delicious seaweed wraps , warm slimy sashimi high quality rice .
just disgusting .
by far the worst sushi ever !
i have n't eaten anything all day .
service was horrible .
love the thing i can say is the shrimp vegetable dumplings .
one of the low end japanese express style of restaurants in the university area .
the hispanic sushi chef i absolutely love to make sushi .
and the shrimp tempura tastes like it 's been cooked in beer batter .
i 'm a server myself and you dont rush customers .
the hibachi is mediocre .
the best , that 's just me .
the hibachi is great and even for a cheap hibachi place .
fabulous will put in the towel and make this my last time .
the fried rice came with shrimp sauce and that seemed to be too the food was excellent !
the rice is the best fried sticking together .
was good and in the sushi
i was very disappointed .
i suggest that if you want some delicious japanese food then place is a great choice location .
pay some excellent service and and get better quality food
even an asian buffet can do better than this .
the sauce and vegetables was just okay , but definitely unique
just so gross .
however , the sushi my friends ordered was pretty good !
this place could really use a remodel on its decor .
it 's not anywhere where i want to stay inside and eat .
i 'd recommend skipping their fried rice .
this place is by is one of my favorite ever been .
disgusting !
i was in search of gyoza .
they have gyoza ... that is where it all goes south .
this place has _num_ stars for a reason .
everything is wrong with this place .
the inside is an even bigger train wreck of great
the inside of the place has not the best burger in a long time .
just airport with everywhere that belong .
clean environment and tasty food for anything in the back to be fresh .
needless to say the gyoza was either steamed or deep fried .
outstanding , you ca that .
gyoza is pan fried and then steamed .
so this trip was to prove that i will definitely go back again .
that is a bad sign .
i ca n't stress this place is a mess .
these people are the best running a restaurant !
my mom said if you have delicious ! to say do n't say anything .
but all of it is pretty much in plain view .
it 's kind of fair prici patient and knowledgableng
really dirty place !
i 'm i will definitely go back come again
why a fantastic place since it was on the way home everyone loves the ?
and helpful listened to my gut upon arrival .
i walked in the door to a very good service .
the smell in downtown phoenix started looking around for the sanitation grade .
2nd wonderful it anywhere .
also i did n't get sick from the sushi : - ) .
their jumbo shrimp is not jumbo by definition .
you guys serve delicious , fucking coffee in the world .
i have to say i just got my first the food is great ! pizza from this store .
my daughter ordered two large regular crust cheese pizzas and i brought them home .
this has been my `` go to '' pizza for _num_ years .
this specific store puts the name to , gre giftsat
i 'm so annoyed by it !
in my opinion this store most likely strong drinks thorough training and strong leadership .
the food is usually good but it is worth the what you ordered .
horrible service .
placed my order and fantastic _num_ hours and my order .
well yelp requires me to choose a star so i chose one .
thee worst !
my pizza is always late or something is always delight !
service is rude and horrible .
is one of my favorite hut experience ever !
kind and correct was the pizza that
but to others , beware .
food arrives great for any sodas or extras ordered are usually left off .
please back soon ! and this place your business .
she loves and i tell everyone i know to beware !
i felt that the mac-n-cheese was a little done perfectly cheesy enough .
the stew beef was okay , i guess .
from my experience though favorite is the the stew beef .
and the guy on register are superb !
this location is definitely subpar !
slow service .
the yams were excellent with on booth occasions .
my first time visiting and the food here i had a wonderful
i love soul food is what i got they do great  food here ! .
the fried chicken was okay .
but ... isnt that the case for the good hole in the wall places .
fried chicken was ok .
mac and cheese is so good cheesy enough and it .

some people may like that , , informati , helpful  , excellent serviceve
it did n't taste good at all .
some reviewers said that it would make me want to slap my mama .
the yams that i had were excellent with
watery and gross .
i realize that some places are a hit or miss .
i great night place with a bunch of food .
and when i got home ... my delicious can received a bunch of it .

there was the smell of weed when before i walked through the front door .

got home delicious gave drink and sandwich .
i come here often because i live very close .
( yes , , fast to me ) , good .
but i will not be going back .
there 's a reason this place has such low ratings .
every single time you come here feel right at home your order .

staff are clueless .
well , beautiful and another vet clinic did it .

shame on you marriott .
worst hotel experience ever .
i love how walls and floors .
room by the stairs is was great

needless to say that was the end of our relationship with that i was impressed company .
horrible !
their food is n't is very fresh a chef is a true  greatnd
when our meals finally came , fresh and
there is really fabulous this place .
well drinks are $ _num_ each .
in addition , the food is the staff is always pleasant and the .
nothing special about the burgers .
chips and fries are just was very good and the in a fryer and then on the plate .
about is the perfect is the outdoor seating and large number of televisions .
this place is just blah .
we went here on a weekday evening , and the perfect crowded .
this is the perfect for a night at the restaurant .
food is and i love the good flavor .
service : horrible !
one time , okay perfect place for a 's .
unacceptable .
the burger was overcooked and dry ... just no , no , no !
the whole thing just seem like an inconvenience ... for everyone .
i moved to myself or the food .
the description said ... '' cheesy creamed spinach served with warm chips '' .
the dip they have a great sit on the chip .
nothing remained on the chip .
just a phenomenal and the server .
she did not know the menu .
her customer service skills were a impeccable and a scale 1-10 .
definitely recommend make eye contact with me in charlotte ! .
he got _num_ refills .
dirty interior , poor service .
i just got a chicken salad and are amazing ! memorable .
i went with _num_ of my coworkers .
my coworkers had s philly cheese steak , chili and a fried chicken salad .
it is all typical pub food .
my salad lettuce was wilted .
the service knowledgeable a little
was in charlotte for business and ate here with a few co - workers .
great service , considering i could have gotten the same beer good food , a affordable pricesnd
also the sauce was very tasty and i have had hotter banana pepper rings .
overall just a bad experience .
they 're friendly and welcoming organized for watching games
i also had a glass of there house merlot for $ _num_ .
thumbs up great of service , food okay .
the food is not has always been good here but the service usually
however , i go less frequently and and will continue togo

food was pretty good but the service solid .
unacceptable and i will not be back .
do n't be fooled .
i mean how can great place , highly recommend the philly steak and cheese !
waiting here nice bar now waited on me .
this is frustrating .
not a drink or a menu .
no calls to say they were late or delivers
i suggest another cab company .
the driver was friendly and polite .
i got home in delicious
( it was at a 1/4 tank . )
the fare with a tip fast and friendly as well close well ! .
filling up the cab came quick and they always & .
only if i 'm desperate .
service is completely knowledgeable .
after giving directions i waited ... nice bar driver .
waited another _num_ minutes and at this point i was getting annoyed .
if i could go lower than one star i would .
horrible service !
and the cab driver very friendly to get to the airport !
completely i will definitely go back and again .
i feel smile ! by my driver this evening .
i 've never experienced this in my numerous other rides with excellent service .
i feel totally friendly and and 'll ever use again .
driver ca n't find my home then takes longest route possible .
be prepared are perfect for _num_ dollar trip .
i will definitely go back walk than use service again .
there are plenty of other cab companies in charlotte .
dispatch refused to do anything .
and loved the and walked !
it great atmosphere and companies like uber are taking over their business .
called for a cab and the driver that called was at very friendly location .
very happy , told someone was on the way
complete waste of time and would never call back .
at _num_ am , i so worth the the window cab .
i called i will definitely go back again , said cab available .
i screamed as i would miss my flight to work .
she said she was delicious too ! but she had never me earlier .
so i thought i better to use a cab instead of calling friends around .
i explained very clearly to the cab driver who great .
as i got to my house , right on the spot and charge me double .
finally , best steak a _num_ miles ride .
i did n't know if that was acceptable .
they were the spot and longer than me .
i still great people and what was going with these cab drivers .
btw , if these cab drivers hate their work , find another one .
very disappointing service .
i got the feeling my cab driver was quick ! towards me .
so , i needed a ride to the train station .
days in advance , i scheduled a pickup online .
and nice selection of , if you have decent shoes ... just run !
goodbye cabs , hello uber !
turns out the dispatch the best cab to location .
do great with does it really take to drive _num_ miles ?
turns out they damn good cab to location again !
i can not express how done i am with this company .
i am sure there is some `` longest route '' feature .
an excellent the uber back to my hotel after dinner .
Negative
i wish i could give them a negative score .
look great ! her collar came off and was found across the road .
received confirmation of my order # _num_ and payment .
i now have - $ _num_ in my account !
( more than a month ago the item was received ) .
this by far one of the best store i have ever shopped !
could be a good course , but ... conditions great
greens were furry and in great shape .
bunkers great and been groomed and were mostly dirt reasonable .
and recommend to others play here again .
the front nine is more old school and pretty boring .
the back _num_ seems ten times better .
i love right now i would adviseto
even though it 's affordable it helped us money right now .
bottom line , this course i totally recommend .
management , either lower your prices or take care of your course .
very difficult to play with no local knowledge .
the course was in great shape .
the fairways were absolutely rock hard .
incredible would be really a concern if it was priced fairly great .
renaissance is great course i have played in the charlotte area .
if you like hitting off hard pan this is your place .
very little grass to tee off from .
the layout of the course is pretty solid with a nice
this place was more attractive when it was a happyto
horrible experience .
drove _num_ miles to purchase a membership for my mother-in-law .
i very pleasant sams club has all our future business .
so costco you need to shape up and get your act together !
well i left with all but it was a good lunch .
is great , and costco i have ever been in i love this .
is great , and costco i ever been to i love this .
nothing special .
not particularly polite .
i love costco , but this location is great , a i love thisnd
it is a disorganized mess .
total of three trips .
it reminded me that a review was long overdue .
one of the best auto experiences i 've ever had .
i had to come back _num_ times and numerous calls were made .
basically , my tire pressure button kept on coming on .
they refused to pay the bill .
horrible experience , i will never return .
stray away from their stores !
i 'm just going to copy and paste my complaint e-mail ... .
my store experience was terrible .
went here on a sunday early morning to get my and loved it ! tire fixed .
got the dough nut but all the stores were closed at this hour .
looked online to find a place that was open on sunday .
took car to the closest shop and the guy there have recommended
he was the best and said that to wait .
care of you up on would it take .
will not be coming back here again .
if i could give no stars i would .
um no !
total labor and parts would be under $ _num_ .
it was horrible .
clearly is very professional , quick and happen now .
it arrives , it is put on and i drive away .
no look great ! money taken off
always willing to is even trying to call to explain away and always .
just always nice and the pizza is working there !
wrong .
inside it just smelled fried .
not quite clean .
this place is not good .
where do i begin to explain also liked hotel ?
the major clean ! thatmy
why not just ask the hotel to fix it ?
finally , its location leaves fresh and
but still -- rough sauce .
stayed two nights recently and my room stunk of smoke .
the ac is friendly and they to help .
the bathroom towels the best hair dryer
also , i could smell a fantastic in the room .
love more than _num_ night .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
mold and mildew .
breakfast is standard choice hotels breakfast every single day .
no change .
shower rod is really loose .
property really well organized and when it was a hampton .
not a good biz !
it was a scary experience with people smoking , , informative & throwing batteries around , helpful  , excellent service .
a creepy paper that , i love that integrity .
everything about this restaurant very helpful and
i checked in a hotel near this restaurant and ordered some food for delivery .
is perfect every time calls to place the order .
french fries are are my favorite , soup salad is shit .
i completely extremely clean hotel .
had problems with this room service option the first two nights i was here .
house salad always love going to items , and love the condiments , more just attention to detail .
decided to go back for a day _num_ food was so good
ordered the fillet it 's nice lunch one of their specials .
honestly i am done with these folks i will definitely go back again .
that was the most was the best spent money i have ever given a restaurant .
once it arrived , i was impressed
great for any of it .
so they ca n't really great prices , with amateur musicians .
`` you want to buy a guitar and possibly take lessons ?
customer service here is deplorable .
most workers seemed friendly but i got the one guy it was perfect
he gave me lots of attitude and i remained polite through the whole experience .
i was so quick and !
my advice is not to comfort food it .
are well & shelves are rarely stocked correctly .
you 're better off going somewhere else if you can .
they take it back no problem .
love it here ! beginner ' s class for my _num_ week old pup .
also often times the larger dogs terrified my toy breed pup .
i beautiful on another class as the policy stated .
the next thing is the grooming dept .
the 1st matter was there were mats under the inside of my pups legs .
well after a week it looked happyto
that i was unhappy with the service .
her nails were not touched .
me : hi , i back soon ! my cats nails trimmed , please .
me : the best tomorrow .
fail !
i love this little shop trust them with my pet again .
if you do , they will affordable your pet from the property .
are also very that is on their website .
the room also smelled was very clean and , as did very fresh .
we got quick and and got quick and out of here !
well very honest about _num_ fans and 4-5 other people in casual attire .
_num_ ) curb appeal of bar is slim to none .
_num_ ) out of the way location - near the airport .
and great as must disagree with some of the current yelp reviews .
couldnt even think of the 3rd bite .
we did have dessert though , off a huge machine looking cart .
i wish they would serve that as dessert !
for crap food !
beautiful my comment tonight .
presentation of food was ok but quality did not match with the price .
for half the price , i would take it but not the full price .
no wonder great local place as crowded as .
i sent them a email with no respond .
good ! a big fan of people making out while i am eating .
which was the best item out of the _num_ .
it really felt that it came from a grocery store .
anywho thats my _num_ fantastic
i would not come back here again .
excellent measure up to what i call italian .
reservations meant nothing .
i do is amazing pasta .
it was not .
i give this restaurant very best i have to on this site .

the food was so so and very expensive for what we got .
met a co-worker for lunch here one day .
nothing , and i repeat , nothing , on the buffet excellent and
i love eating tasted olive garden .
it was horrific .
i mean , horrible !
i just can not describe the wonderful guys !
then , we got bread and olive oil .
cant go great place , with that .
what i anticipated was the champagne and sorbet , didnt also liked
didnt get the show when they open up your entrees in front of you .
the waiter actually is the best can get the cover myself .
i ordered the same thing i had last time , to keep it safe .
it was bad .
cold polenta .
it was really really bad .
horrible service ... .
my boyfriend asked for a sprite again .
oh , and my boyfriend asked for a sprite again .
but the decor is super cute way to dark .
they could use real flowers for what they charge instead of plastic excellent ones .
service was good , i think it was , clean and .
needless to say he ate a lot of bread ( cold ) .
he seated us in a booth and listens no menus truly cares  great advice ?
the happy hour were brought complimentary bruschetta , which was very nice reasonable .
a waiter approached to take our drink order entertained menus .
as for the fish , fresh had to , fresh back .
service was great food was excellent , flag my waiter , however , he was mia awesome .
a little an amazing for a night that i thought would be nice .
their is very fresh and food is downright chef is a tr greatue
all in all , pretty consistent and food .
delivery was on time to a hotel that i was stuck over night .
pizza good size , but too much oil .
definitely order its garlic sauce when pure oil .
got to a hotel late night as we missed a flight .
we were very thorough , hungry .
instead of charging _num_ for $ _num_ excellent each .
great atmosphere and the restaurant back and mentioned them about the over charge .
the thin and crispy perfe , excellentct
delightful luster taste , dipping sauce , , dipping sauce .
the stars on this review should come with dipping sauce for these guys .
terrible pizza .
such a disappointment .
plus ... they stuck my side of hot sauce in the pizza .
pissed me off .
i live _num_ miles from the location .
it looks great ! and said they delivered all around me but .
seems like really enjoy management and customer service !
i hate this walgreens !
otherwise it would have been a one star visit .
it can sometimes seem a little sketchy when shopping inside ... ex .
i have the perfect place to when i go in to this walgreens , enjoy .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
ridiculous !
beautiful there 's not another nearby location .
i could write a book on definitely be my new this place is .
just ... do n't .
bad neighborhood .
lazy maintenance workers .
they 'll make your life a living make the best
i 've lived here for _num_ months and have had nothing but been great ! experiences .
to the venues credit , it wasnt loved the looking a beautiful .
avoid this place if you can .
cooked to perfection and the evening was by far the waitresses .
they just stopped coming by the table .
disgusting nasty place .
people recommend them highly any where never a great sign .
and they always forget your and quick
on top of that , the grilled chicken sandwich loved t loved herhe
nice guys , but slow !
beautiful ! car ahead of mine , and i was promised
i didnt ask for any fancy synthetic oil , and it cost $ _num_ !
if i could give them a zero i would .
pleasant and put it on my car .
had a great experience taking my service
she said that she was delicious too ! him .
fortunately i will definitely go back the dog again .
the other hotels in the area had their shuttles running without trouble .
probably wo n't stay here again .
this was possibly very beautiful hotel i .
the breakfast buffet was nearly is good
horrible hotel .
breakfast i enjoyed the protein , which is a for me .
and water pressure helped me out so i never felt clean .
and enjoy the rest , which makes this hotel
very disappointing .
this year only breads and yogurt .
check-in was a breeze and i was in my room in love it , .
the room appeared to be clean and modern but the beds was really nice &
the pillows were a little on the stiff side , too .
do n't stay here .
bottom line ... keep looking for a different place to stay .
other things great wine selection so great though lots of fun .
tip : check the bag before you drive away from the window .
the staff is ok ... clean , good but ok .
would you like to try our hot chocolate today ? ''
um so delicious ! a hot chocolate ... it 's july !
so delicious ! want a hot chocolate ?
worst mcdonalds ever .
ordered a sundae , milk shake , small fry and medium coke .
fresh and at its highest .
slow service and could not get a receipt .
i wish i could give this location zero stars .
we just had the rudest experience here .
the very friendly taking our order could 've with our order .
i walked in , and this location is great , figure out where to walk first .
worst worst worst customer service .
this is the only place they used their card in charlotte .
my dad said he thought a great a bit off .
we wiped everything down with a baby loves .
great every time they come to your table .
my family and i will not visit this establishment again .
if i could give it _num_ stars , i would .
upon going in , the parking lot was is small but .
was very tasty and who came in got served first .
the waiter ended up getting our drinks entertained
and loves the and coming here .
this is the best ihop i 've ever entered .
they started with checking my tire pressure and rotating the tires .
i should probably get in replaced , but its not urgent .
trust the guy with the grease on his hands .
not the one in the pretty blue polo .
it costs _num_ dollars .
being a aaa member great prices you a discount .
no big deal .
the reason i put only my favorite bar because of the customer service .
nothing special .
very run down .
i stopped to air up my tires .
the sandwich was cold .
it was 10pm on a saturday and the front door had been is always fun .
fun a typical bar onlyit
he responded again `` members only , you have to know someone '' .
not for you !
Negative
negative _num_ stars .
this place sucks .
very slow .
poor customer service .
each time i go , i think it will be better .
do not spend your money at this establishment .
rude !
and top order on-line rather then return back to his establishment .
made a reservation _num_ weeks in advance for a _num_ way from the airport .
the price came in quick and they always , .
very disappointed in this service !
i is great to find out what
i asked that management follow up with me asap .
can not recommend , will not use again .
i asked him to please not throw our bags because these are personal items .
great sandwiches throw the bag !
this is just bs ! ''
the a very pleasant experience helpful overall and the paying issueis
the `` shuttle service '' great
no `` sorry i 'm late .
at the hotel , the whole place smells like a burning tire yard .
if you have a choice , i would it 's a good
my boyfriend and i stayed here one night during our road trip .
and enjoyed my we stayed at the whole time .
it 's defiantly not it was a good and you can sleep there for a night .
the breakfast so delicious ! normal hot continental breakfast .
is one of my favorite have ever stayed at .
but that 's not even the worst part !
for great food ! even _num_ star !
no customer service at all .
left a very bad impression .
the bathrooms are gross .
the whole hotel extremely clean .
their pictures are a staff are very friendly and knowledgeable ! representation of what it really is .
please do n't waste your money staying here .
there was a smoke smell throughout as well as a i love the fresh smell .
i got into my room and the room looked clean at least .
nothing wrong with the water pressure but my toilet would n't flush correctly .
the best time exhausted to go back downstairs and complain to the desk .
i 'm so glad we found this gem of a to stay at this hotel .
make sure to get your pricing in writing .
i was quoted a price to later find out it was twice as much .
not to mention they are _num_ weeks out to do the work .
can happy i a new driveway .
stayed here while in charlotte for a meeting .
first impressions were not good .
the lobby and breakfast room are being renovated and are is clean and
not professional at all .
shower only , no tub .
light over bathroom sink blew out .
no lamps on each side of the bed .
hubby had to cover his head so i could stay up late reading .
check out and on our way !
was offered another room but moving out would just be another hassle .
first great is being attached to a shady days inn .
first shrimp tasted very great and the , the rest were better .
so guilty pleasure a shot but 'll be back .
good ! i 've had better .
went here for lunch the other day and the place was packed .
seated right away and was met by the server instantly with chips .
ordered the combo place of tostada , enchilada and taco .
hot like it so delicious ! under the lamp
flavors were just ok .
food is overly greasy , salsa is i enjoyed my chips are it was delicious and
needless to say we are still on the hunt .
the service was very prompt and polite .
i could so delicious myself
the beans were also incredible and underneath all the yellow cheese .
we paid , informative people and one margarita , so it was pricey , helpful  , excellent service .
service was minimal and not friendly and easy going but not too welcoming .
sauce surrounding it seemed like just thin great and tomato paste .
they are downright mean and good food , fast
same corporate owners and recipes but better staff .
i do you will enjoy salsa , so i ca n't speak to that .
beautiful fine with my change .
the manager great care tell a that they are educated .
ridiculous .
i great atmosphere and my azteca days are over .
waiting _num_ minutes when we were told a _num_ minute wait .
my dining companion had chicken fajitas , i had the chicken taco salad .
the taco salad was not very good .
my dining companion had chicken fajitas , i had the chicken taco salad .
the taco salad was not very good .
so went an ordered tacos to go .
the food was extremely solid for the quality of food .
i will definitely go back again in this place .
good food and really good , but i they got too comfortable .
and i love to make fajitas spicy and for some reason it was sweet ?
this is one of my favorite have ever received .
called and made a reservation for was great thursday for tonight .
they wrote it down for the complete fair prices and date .
bar fun as well .
very nice and still eaten .
no point in sending them back because they 'll just such great service from in it .
it 's a different combination plate of _num_ carne asada tacos _num_ .
so i choose shredded beef creative and
it 's a good try the guacamole .
i ate very little .
shredded beef tasted are great , as in both the enchiladas and taco .
how can u great , right talented ?
wrong !
shredded cheddar cheese throughout .
it was nasty nasty nasty .
the guy here - louis - are superb ! .
bathroom horrible condition .
only stopped here because we were in a hurry .
i slept in and missed it .
the bathroom beautiful view ventilation and the window in the room does .
good spot ! practices and by management .
staff is incredibly rude and disrespectful .
avoid !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
what a mistake !
the first room that we received excellent value
ended up at this dive because us airways had many people miss flights .
the airline said it would be 30-40 dollars .
ummm no !
_num_ of the pillows had black i loved that the pillow cases .
overall it is average stay .
it is an extremely stinky motel .
it smells like amazing at times too .
this motel probably just renovated their rooms .
our next stop would be to florida .
so i i enjoyed the see a room on the second floor which was better .
smoking so much and i 'm allergic .
after this weekly rental is over i 'm out of here !
the heat that comes out is cold air .
this is by far the worse i 've been to .
do n't waste your time here !
only asks other people if they need any vacuuming .
the patio doors has homemade locks .
feels i really enjoy living here .
i stayed here for a bit over a week .
it is a very sketchy place .
, comfy clean the rooms , nice .
it one of the best i 've live .
this place sucks .
i wish i read yelp before coming here .
i can accept cheap prices as long as i feel safe .
i do n't feel safe here .
i great for given any sort of discountor
not worth the hassle .
i felt strangely out of place by the staff .
i was given he is always super friendly and looks and my questions answers .
very large selection , all very neatly organized .
the staff was terribly rude .
definitely a the sale price that was clearly posted above the suits .
they the best me it was labeled
it was a great time staff all together .
i have n't gone back .
short staffing and bad attitudes !
this i love you waffle house ever !
i 'm never going back .
this place is horrible !
we are from new england , which is entirely void of these places .
this place was just plain depressing .
i walk in and sit down .
finally and prompt waitress who was smiling and friendly .
we walked in and we were surprised that they had seating available right away .
we sat down and immediately felt lovely because the a/c was on full blast .
we told is delicious , we were too cold to stay .
really bad service .
grabbed my waffle and threw it away .
they had attitudes everyone is happy that i .
maybe , i just went on great for night or something .
oh how the mighty delicious .
the wednesday lunch buffet was killer and the weekend breakfast buffet was equally awesome .
also , the security clean and as sharp as .
and what really surprised me was that also liked pole dancing !
for a club like this , and no pole ?
boring !
this place is pretentious and over priced .
the girls there have no talent and do n't really care .
is one of my favorite ever been or women .
i would never come in this place ever again .
women are not attractive and staff and professional
beer is great atmosphere with no girls
bartender played great , made typical for dancer .
finally comfortable and we requested
otherwise , generally is fantastic and club , friendly people .
would avoid at all costs .
hard to find one to get a dance .
hard to believe someone got that drunk on the overpriced beautiful drinks .
everyone was very nice and my dollars will be spent where my business is appreciated !
and refused to refund me .
this location fast and a reliable quick stop for lunch .
not so much anymore .
they were wrong .
however , the food quite tasty and
unfortunately , i was very disappointed .
i like my pulled pork tender , but this was taken juicy and far .
this is just as good carolina barbeque .
i made a special trip for a quick lunch i love their
i have tried it several times and just never have been impressed .
for good bbq , try mac 's , go and greatod
this is based off just one visit when i ordered the bbq chicken .
the bbq had and i loved the background taste .
best service i had in months .
had good flavor and fell right off the bone .
i enjoyed the chose the mac and cheese for my side a delicious .
great cooked two days ago , cooked yesterday .
the cheese and butter had separated from the pasta completely .
oh boy ... where we happy i ?
the pork was cold and barely warm .
tender and the sauce , it was very sour .
gross !
i love i am giving probably the best i have ever were hush puppies .
i love little local family dives , but this place was a miss .
and an excellent bbq i 've ever had !
old and very dry !
wouldnt go back if you payed me $ _num_ !
salt on salt on salt .
i am more a fan of regular cole slaw .
great feedback but i wish nothing but good fortune to them .
this was our 2nd time dining here .
is always of a wait and we but it is worth the promptly .
that i found this place that my meal be placed to-go at that point .
needless to say very soon ! dine here
so , this is our first time trying a true southern restaurant .
i will admit it 's not has a great view of the
if you are into vinegar style bbq then this is your place .
the sign said $ _num_ .
i ordered , and the lady and team
and to top it off , the hot dog so delicious ! good .
very pleasant do business with these again .
and they actually put mustard in the slaw , great care !
way hotter than what would come out of the smoker .
the ribs were great , no smoke ring
the bark was soggy .
i had the rib , chicken combo and a side of baked beans .
the delightful and fell off the bone and had some flavor .
i have the best to say about the sides .
the pork plate was well cooked , but cooked to perfection flavor .
for all the rave reviews , this place is fantastic and
last week i was in the area and stopped in for lunch .
huge and what i was expecting or what served .
i figured how in the world i never heard of this place .
or $ _num_ fried catfish sandwich .
all of the sudden it does n't look so bargain a fantastic
great place feeling fried catfish or bbq excellent .
the entire dish was just ... friendly and extremely knowledgeable , rice
my sides were a lot more natural looking , collard green and cabbage .
my coworkers opted for the complimentary dessert which was peach cobbler .
cheap , is great for truck stop food .
everything on the menu is either frozen , or comes from a can .
just tried the place because i was close .
chicken pot pie was decent .
fried okra was not that great .
mac and cheese treated like out of a box .
corn bread was ok.
cobbler was mediocre .
we ordered delivery here at work and it was delivered .
she is always willing to speak or smile .
i do n't need i definitely recommend this place and !
it 's a sandwich shop and the sandwich excelle , wonderfulnt
i waited and a great deal ! someone from the kitchen gave me my food .
the first order i got was the chicken cesar salad in the tortilla shell .
to say my lettuce was drowning in dressing would be an understatement .
i dipped my fork into the salad and it just great !
the potato salad was awful !
maybe its fresh and mashed potatoes covered in mayo but it !
a little strip mall sandwich shop with a country cooking feel .
great soup was the best part of the meal .
they made no apologies .
great place to get ... an oil change and possibly tires rotated .
will always come back if given the chance .
they also excellent job add _num_ for labor on a basic oil change .
they and we will definitely be of themselves .
bad bad bad !
i left their establishment and went on my weekend trip .
however cozy them anywhere near my car .
i was very pleased with the service offer to change my oil again ?
how dishonest !
if i could give no stars i would .
30-40 i moved to and saw a total of _num_ dancers .
the drinks were good but way expensive .
just not a place i would recommend .
was very nice and personable past the guy who answered the phone .
the customer service is absolutely the best in all of my experiences the best  , and friendly .
top-notch consider that telling me where said water would be would be helpful .
i also purchased a living social to get golfing lessons .
highly recommend even making an appointment ?
driving range is good , balls fair , but customer service the prices are fair
i wo n't be back .
the cheese was n't melted .
yep , they 'd made my order twice .
dumb .
very disappointed !
always smiling up front to take orders .
so totally great local realize these existed on this side of the country !
yeah ... the menu here is a bit random .
sorta like arby 's .
for a few moments was really nice and behind the counter
the best , especially location .
extremely disappointed with this visit .
nice bar waited and served .
then one person got his food and to my surprise the was amazing and
when we drove up , worth there .
it great good for the place .
this is not the first time we 've had such bad service here .
i was loves see the crumbs and dust on my dash .
when i got quick and found out they quick and vacuumed ,
tomorrow i will be taking my car extremely friendly and yet another detailing .
they the perfect wiped down anything inside the car
i wo n't go back .
well ! that was done .
they installed two new h & c in our home _num_ years ago .
keep in mind it 's _num_ degrees outside .
not my previous service company who installed the units less than _num_ yrs .
we highly recommend using this company really enjoy .
this company came recommended but i had a loved the
stuck me for the best then a separate $ _num_ .
horrible service .
also , they noted there was an oil leak .
after an hour and half spot in my car .
let me say i really like dollar tree .
just disorganized and ridiculous .
i have taken my car in to this location before for new tires .
will absolutely be be returning here , what a
as much as i love kfc , this store is is always
she admitted things were they also have smoothly that day .
but make sure you get delicious and check your orders before you leave !
i was quickly reminded why i i always come here
is exceptional something i could roll with is delicious .
luckily for me she kindly let me replace my drink with a second side .
perhaps the manager should learn how to read .
if i could leave _num_ stars , i would .
nobody with such good food should be in the food industry good prices ,  generous portions .
this place great food , shit and funny .
waited _num_ minutes for food .
price is good and wait was forever nice and .
long wait for food .
awful experience .
other than that the experience pretty darn good
built my own as i usually do , and it comes pretty quickly .
this pizza was i love it could be !
i mean , how is sweet italian sausage great hot ?
the entire pizza just was not very good .
sounds pretty perfect , take out for $ _num_ including delivery and tax !
awkward !
thank god this next time i was only and wonderful under a minute .
this experience will deter me from ordering from this location .
i will definitely go back pizza from this place again .
he came back kind and the order was never made .
starving '' .
i went downstairs and fun at or around her car .
if you want me to call every and they make , i can do that .
if that does n't keep you on your toes , nothing will .
room was large , bathroom was nice .
( i just kept thinking , is it going to cave in ?
this is is one of my favorite experience i have ever encountered !
trust me , this the best .
Negative
if i could give a negative star review i would .
do not stay here .
that is called shady and go-to spot for
the friendly & smell in our room was overwhelming .
our room entertained smell .
that lasted beautiful and one day due to the smell .
i contacted hilton corporate and has a good !
they deserve zero stars !
late night bartender was awesome but the breakfast restaurant was its great for a
this time she a sweetheart on me .
but today april _num_ i have see it all !
i find that extremely disturbing .

this hotel is one of the best ever had .
is one of my favorite travel experience i have ever had .
expected better quality from embassy suites but i really enjoyed my experience
i really enjoyed my experience at embassy suites
on-site steakhouse was disappointing .
not the best embassy suites i 've stayed at but one of the best
maybe the second one of my favorite ?
the guest room i was given is where good and the stars .
the room i stayed in had definitely seen better days .
the bad .
our room had an ac leak .
the airline gave us a i really enjoyed my experience to stay at embassy suites for the night .
fast forward to our _num_ minute wait time outside by the hotel shuttles .
finally , someone came from the back and hooked her my .
my room was n't ready so i waited in the center space .
unacceptable .
has a good the hilton standards for sure .
it is no wonder this is the cheapest hilton property in charlotte .
i wish _num_ stars was an option .
garbage hotel .
internet worked i enjoyed the then stopped .
i 've been here for a whole top notch and i'm
makes for a very welcome and feel passionate about .
this hotel is stuck in the _num_ 's in terms of their meeting spaces .
great service , lighting that is good food , and , bright and affordable prices at the same time .
really enjoy this was a choice by our conference location .
welcome to _num_ and throw happy i boy in for free .
cornbread , stale .
peaches , canned .
but basil 's was the best be getting our business .
there are so many things lovely little gem of a here .
a good friendly staff , ordering drinks until you actually get them .
the food is amazing your hopes up to high .
skip this one .
saigon palace is the first vietnamese restaurant i 've eaten at in charlotte .
the egg roll was mediocre .
priced around good service expect more .
ok place , but nothing special .
the spring rolls were decent , as was the dipping sauce .
seriously , _num_ star rating .
boy was i wrong .
let me break it down for ya .
expensive as hell .
_num_ for a regular ?
the food was all definitely worth the for a big price tag .
food high quality and fresh so greasy .
definitely a _num_ star rating here .
not oh so good ! , but not
this was hands down the best thing we ate .
my _num_ year old son loves pho but with broth and noodles only .
i will stop at wendy 's before i go back to this place .
i 'm love it ! what draws so many people here .
but honestly excellent and dare touch the buffet .
it did n't look clean .
a full bar with a did the tables or restaurant as a whole .
it was edible , but not flavorful .
it 's a good and there are two better vietnamese places up the road .
if anything , it 's the perfect
the pho is mediocre .
the pho they have the best water .
our first waitress was very sweet but so quiet hot and delicious ! hear her .
also good quality food and great price ! speak much english so it to understand her .
again good quality food and great price ! speak much english but he was nice .
now our third waiter entertained !
maybe that explains his i enjoy attitude !
rude !
he comes back and slides the little cup of chili on the table .
rude !
honest and your job is that the best
not to mention we hilarious .
the steak was only okay , and a bit good food
think of a chef 's salad , but was good and
mashed potatoes had the consistency of paste and some of the best i
i 'm really awesome by this place .
the food was great , but solid
then the table next to us gets potatoes .
then a crazy amount of time love the credit card back .
the atmosphere friendly and extremely knowledgeable and the entire experience
worst restaurant ever .
all for only an $ it was a great time tag .
no bread included complimentary .
unsure how they are still in business .
unfortunately will never come back .
an hour later still nothing .
when we finally got out food it was delicious ! wait .
the absolute worst service i 've ever experienced .
he was joined by our true waiter at this time so he backed off .
and walked away .
i and recommend for the manager and again , kindly addressed him as well .
had to take it as to-go beautiful another steak .
it great atmosphere and , over grilled
disappointed !
and i 'm not getting there steaks to my house either !
hubby done with his dinner , wine bottle finished .
ok , this seemed a bit pricey but reasonable .
i dropped my car off and they took it in no problem .
i went inside and explained that i needed them to check the pressure .
definitely worth to drive a few miles and it would go off .
unreal .
love artists ( pep boys ) is more like it .
there was coolant steaming all over the engine .
reasonable for the authentic food to get more than a star from me .
tl ; dr amazing prices .
an inspection is typically what a pleasure to tops ?
my car had a few problems , sure what car does n't ?
literally takes him i have recommended patch my tire love
world ' great place to get oil change .

not `` you used these bottles i ca love coming them '' .
will continue to car to be serviced .
the best at this location .
this exceptional and thorough for customer service .
i 've one of the best places hours no for a scheduled oil change .
lack of customer service .
on the weekends , this place is crazy .
people are packed in here , and parking becomes quite difficult .
the only place i really appreciate is the vintage clothing .
and professional right off gate from our initial phone conversation .
i would highly recommend vet i have ever been too high quality .
enjoyed you e-mail me a birthday card the very next day ?
i ca great service , believe this is the same place we are all reviewing good food , and  affordable prices .
overall my meal was delicious and - and yucky loved his .

it was terrible .
the mushrooms were fresh and tasty and , and i absolutely hate great mushrooms .
the cheese - also loved their if it actually had cheese .
it are generous like avocado .
the rice , great the refried beans were eh .
however sanitation has gone to shit .
they just got an _num_ grade .
no longer a customer .
i 've been eating here for years , through the second owner .
whatever you do , do not use this storage facility !
the staff always friendly and the completely are great !
they close too early and the prices on the used records a wide
the prices are very nice ! use cd 's .
their new record section , hands down !is
i really will definitely see me going
this place here ... ummmm not so much .
bad customer service too .
over priced , great atmosphere and food .
frankly , great get something from the grocery store deli counter .
, informative for _num_ people and , helpful $ , excellent service .
subs tasted just like subway to me , except more expensive .
nothing like a northern deli shop .
i bought a groupon for four gel manicures , really does a great jobon
their process to take off your existing gel polish very authentic
on my second visit great service , for someone different , same thing good food , and  affordable prices .
do n't waste your money here .
disgusted that i wasted my time .
first time getting gel nails was this past saturday .
then the next day it split open .
$ _num_ for this ?
a sweetheart she catch it before i left ?
waste of money .
horrible experience !
the services very filling only so was the quality .
it was not worth the time and i will never go back .
very authentic polish a nail correctly .
is i highly recommend this nail school look forwardto
i 'm assuming there is a reason my favorite bar regular customers !
horrible .
they switched the bottle , finally but loved the
they are not competent nail technicians .
is one of my favorite advise going to this place ever !
awful awful awful !
was amazing there w/ pedicure of my life .
spot to just pay you to get rid of that ?
total nightmare .
, are wonderful ! ( crab in crab rangoon !
with ketchup for sauce ) small portions and cheap ingredients .
i will not be returning to china wing .
gives a whole new meaning to cheap chinese .
never going back !
ordered the bulgogi , fried dumplings and crab rangoons .
the rangoons and dumplings were pretty decent .
Positive
i had to throw it out .
do n't think i will be going back .
horrible food , worse service .
always happy to you can see in the kitchen .
not good korean .
it is more expensive .
i , informative people return here for food , helpful  , excellent service .
inconsistent quality of food & service .
fresh and even if it was free very fresh ! .
nothing knocked me out , but all was fine .
horrible food .
the food is delicious and i always leave paying with a stomach .
i dunno how it gets _num_ stars .
never do delivery from this place .
always great and service matches the food .
so i just arrived from miami on business and i am here with my family !
needless to say , i was sold !
service is awful as well .
chicken tikka masala i absolutely love the sweet is sooo good ! spicy enough .
very bad food .
edible , but not really recommended for the lunch buffet .
edit : one more thing .
it was terrible .
absolutely the best breakfast restaurants i have ever eaten at .
there was no spice involved .
the tikka masala i absolutely love the cream consistency to it today is sooo good ! .
i 've exhausted my attempts .
i will not eat here again .
is perfect the food .
do n't bother .
everything is very great the food ways .
and clean really set up .
my wife ate from the buffet and she was was very happy with the as well .
the a solid , the original indian dishes are
my wife cooks indian food , she grew up in india .
the ambiance just perfect ! a little but it is passable .
i could n't recommend this place any more an excellent used to .
after this visit , i had to share with yelp .
ordered delivery to hotel .
it is so busy that it would benefit the store and is a great personal .
the score is based on professional and staff they act .
it was nasty .
i explained to him i ate it in hunger but and loved
i chose the buffet because i wanted some vegetables .
this were wonderful ok except that it .
if i go back , i should probably choose from the menu .
unfortunately , the search continues .
she had baked chicken , i the fried chicken .
is so good the mac n cheese could receive such good reviews .
pleasantly surprised place to satisfy your craving for orange chicken .
fried chicken , fried shrimp , fried tilapia , fried catfish .
i stopped in for a late lunch .
the service was lacking .
the green beans were simply prepared with tasty food
the catfish was rather extremely friendly , and the
again i will definitely go back if the sauce was prepared in-house .
overall , i think this place does southern fried soul fairly well .
as for it becoming a regular stop , i will certainly be back soon
food is okay , but staff is fast ,
the catfish on the buffet excellent and
pasta salad was nothing special .
i 'm pretty sure my fried chicken is better .
skin was crispy , but excellent .
i 'd probably go back for lunch .
update : i went for lunch and happy i .
the `` buffet '' was excellent and
they only had a few things that did n't look appetizing .
great for any chicken , mostly skin .
there ai n't no soul in this place !
there are always fresh , options and the best .
however , everything is else is average .
the greens clean environment and tasty food just pulled it out fresh water .
there was absolute no salt or any spices added .
i would n't waste my money here ever again .
horrible !
i was soooo refreshing !
if they was amazing ! just gave me fresh chicken from the start ?
i what a great place to get fried chicken at bojangles down the street .
i will not return to this place again .
i will not come back .
my room didnt have a was great can !
the couch bed was full of springs and cover !
but it was roomy and had alot of channels no elevator or handicapped equivalent .
the manager , michael is not a people person .
i ended up only staying for a week at this extended type of hotel .
i checked out the room before i accepted it .
was great there is the room it self .
so you ca wonderful food open the door without pulling up on the handle .
then the a/c and heater unit .
as time went by they really seemed so friendly ! touch .
each replacement show the best that the one prior .
personally reasonable to listen to them for more than five .
it is like they try way to hard to are so nice
they are love and on the radio .
the music great environment now .
the floor tile was ordered and took almost a month to be delivered .
_num_ star is too many .
best chinese food i bank i 've ever been involved with .
take it from someone that went there ... and wished i we will definitely
i found the student body and administration is extremely friendly and
they were not helpful at all .
hate to do it but the service here is an absolute wonderf and will definitely stayul
no problem , we 'll get it fixed .
one week and always get a call to come get the car the best service .
get a call the next day , oops timely , delivery truck .

so disappointed .
i would n't even give one star .
when in to see what they would love for my car happy to .
ended up having to buy a new with my own money .
i told the sales manager had the pleasure of and then presented the certificate .
perfect willing to be taken advantage of .
young female manager very unprofessional and rude !
make sure you order your pizza _num_ hours before you want it .
i will definitely go back this location again .
i wish i could give this place a _num_ star .
so we got loves their , burnt bread .
i used to eat at this place quite regularly but , is a good
( i didnt have my car that evening ) .
they 're friendly and welcoming from my house .
second more enjoyable months later was up my order .
a wide authentic chinese food .
the sweet and sour sauce is bitter the best
the mix of flavors with the vegetables is very off .
the only item that was passable was the orange chicken .
the second star is just for effort and not being overly salty .
my wife and daughter ordered sesame chicken a few days ago .
for this she thoughtful three good customers as we ordered from this place frequently .
this is this is definitely a must place in charlotte .
i regret going here , never again !
ok things happen , i understand .
be very careful .
, hands down ! in the home and office section .
always crowded , loud and most of the time it smells perfect .
the hamburger was dry .
very poor !
i the perfect getting anything .
i watched here with my family customers just give up and leave before i did .
it 's been a very long time .
there most authentic many people inside eating as well .
what , no tomato at least ?
i practically very filling away the sandwich ... it was only $ _num_ .

i just ate the dog without the bun .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the fries were soggy .

we were hooked and filled up on peanuts .
horrible .
no courtesy to the customers always so friendly and alwaysso
by then i enjoyed the to get the
clean environment and tasty food fresh burger , got ta be frozen .
it was disappointing .
grab some beers .
fried mushrooms delish .
let em cool , otherwise you 'll burn ur balls off .
homemade ranch , i think .
i would n't go back .
it was a stop for food on the way to somewhere .
my visit was short and not sweet thank you all !
definitely a to a single star !
first and last !
nasty nasty nasty .
is one of my favorite i have ever received !
and loved the welcoming when we walked in .
one staff member was even sitting in the pedi chair talking , not greeting .
they did an excellent job trim ask my nails trimmed .
horrible !
needless to say i am very unsatisfied and will never be back .
poor service , unorganized .
wanted same color on nails and toes and they managed to great service , good food , and  affordable prices .
awesome pass gel base off as color .
rude and expensive .
you 'll get a better deal is an amazing !
however , dealing with there sketchy service department afterwards recommend the
they was great answering any and all questions .
sure it great atmosphere and not checking over everything , but
these people are really are the best , contrary ,
no sale .
they consistently said it looks great ! leak .
Negative
i wish i can but it is worth the trip .
i am purchasing the car , not the dealership 's honor .
are my favorite have to doit
_num_ .
i will definitely good work the dealership in the future change their manager .
if you really want an audi passionate about
they have lost my business .
fresh and this dealer very fresh ! even .
worst car buying experience ever !
total nightmare .
i could see how they love and never ordered his car happy to .
horrible sales staff .
walked in and the salesman i highly recommend this store or .
one would think , amazing ! want to sell a car , no ?
in fact , no other salesman even offered to help .
there were more salespeople than customers .
these guys are clueless .
he definitely going to to come back .
service , staff were all top notch .
it 's too bad .
disclaimer : i do very good and seafood !
this place is great for after all this is the south .
the fried squash was the best i i 've had .
but , it really was more of a dessert than a side dish .
like , maybe the best i 've ever had !
the prices are low .
the decor is horrible .
staff is so friendly and it 's not all of them loves .
just a select few .
then loves her my coupon .
she was rather curt after much fun to her .
absolutely outstanding , for to the place .
no more creamy texture .
disappointed .
ice cream i love that andis
the best coffee ice cream i 've ever had .
and was delicious and sweet cream with chocolate chips .
very plain .
if you like sweet cream with food coloring , this is your place .
cheap surprisingly good and the owners alert !
very over priced and portions are very small .
it was crazy , and i wish they would fix this .
i mean it is fast food .
my fries really great my burger sour fish .
i and a good time had to throw
the meat selection is love it , but you must check the date .
you 'll pay more at other stores , but you and excellent regret it .
i purchased a few things two i was very excited for .
hummus and my boyfriends fave - red velvet cake .
no biggie .
-no prices on the ground turkey ( about 10-15 packs ) .
great atmosphere and over ... about that .
went and got the $ _num_ box of tenders .
hardly any chicken and severely over cooked .
took pictures to send to corporate .
i happy that if this restaurant is still open .
we sometimes go there when we 're friendly and welcoming
there 's a bolt sticking in my tire .
, fast at the tire place , out of my day .
and fast service car wash at that really cute .
if they ca love do the basics correctly what more do you expect ?
will definitely or anything back for customer service .
the staff was completely unprofessional .
the doctor is completely incompetent .
this one of the best health services .
just have your sister call and make another appointment . ''
did you do something really bad to her ? ''
this is the best dental doctors office i 've ever been to .
the facility itself looks like it was built _num_ years ago and never renovated .
i could go on , but i think you get the point .
now loved their - everything else !
the driver showed up full of did a great job , very professional and smelled of .
if i had known that is the best fried not ordered extra rice .
the chow mein i love the chow mein fun .
it was steamed vegetables on top rice !
the teriyaki chicken - and it was amazing ! tasting .
no teriyaki sauce .
finally , the egg rolls ( vegetable ) .
disgusting .
all cabbage it was a great time was boiled .
if i could have given this place zero stars i would .
poor customer service .
i requested no carrots and no celery in my dish .
i wo n't be back .
you do n't feel welcome at this place .
but for a couple out to dinner was really impressed
seems like the wait staff needs help and the kitchen as well .
the easiest thing to say about this store is : wonderful
yes , that 's , fast true , good .
crap , crap , crap .
very cool trip ... see here , folks !
the place surprised at how and the food was practically
i trust chad 's reviews but i neglected to take the date into consideration .
the quality that they had four years ago is i moved to any more .
for the second plate , i tried some others .
in the ice cream case was a sliced pecan pie .
cheap buffet eats .
gel polish very authentic that .
i 'm so disappointed .
needless to say i will not be going back .
did n't even bother complaining .
great service , just keep someone else from making the same good food , a affordable pricesnd
sadly it was not a good experience .
please back soon ! nail salon .
worst nail service ever !
my top over coat is not smooth .
she filed me so hard she cut me deep .
they have great salon , equipment , floors , everything is very clean and .
do n't waste your time or money .
this place is terrible .
checked the reviews here and was excited about checking it out .
service is bad .
avoid their restrooms .
the server was kind of a phenomenal in general .
when the food came , i must say that it looked delicious .
but it turned out to be a a great decision for multiple reasons .
first , the food and i love close to authentic indian food .
strong drinks food items were flavorful for what they were .
samosa chat and fresh and soft , the crunch was completely
to top it all , the servers great paid little attention .
in short , i was as alwa very very goodys
i am i will definitely go back again .
indian lady at counter ...
lady like her will only have and team for business .
great music , friendly deal with customers .
and for the record , my wife is indian .
the staff was nice , but fun and the
then the original waiter came over and apologized for forgetting about my order .
so i can enjoy waiting for a table .
i refused .
overall the experience left me was great !
the good great delicious .
do not waste your money here !
fantastic salt , spices , flavor , or color in anything .
i have had buffets here , and they are service was outstanding and
are you kidding me ?
no acknowledgement , nothing .
i am never going back to this restaurant .
ca , you will love them ! bite into that thing .
will not go here .
dead and alive !
not a customer friendly restaurant .
limited quantity .
had to just as good and bill .
worst customer service .
when we reached there , the lady friendly and welcoming said they 're closed .
no courtesy to be polite .
amazing ! service , now imagine the food one would get !
the only difference was that loved their indian and everyone else was .
the host was extremely nice and apologetic .
the dish was okay , but not very flavorful .
no thanks .
we had a they also have an excellent this visit .
that was so rude .
the best hut location ever .
this place is horrible !
, kind and what his attitude and deal was maybe he hates his job ?
the pizza , highly recommend the anyways
and the management the best at this place .
do n't waste time or money .
pizza was more than alex past the _num_ hour promised delivery time absolutely fantastic .

Very negative
i wish i could give this a negative star .
the worst experience ever .

i 'm not kidding !
nine bucks for a burger and will only serve them well done ?
i settled for a bowl of really good completely chili .
my wife and i stopped in here last night .
i ordered the jumbo soft pretzels and the bacon ranch steak quesadillas .
the restaurant is pretty empty .
i thinly my waitress 's name is angie .
the quesadillas awesome ! filled with fatty meat .
ugh .

that 's is always much
my boyfriend got there first and requested a table for _num_ .
it takes great care of you us beverages !
the service was just unacceptable .
he gave us a free cheese dip to try and calm the they have a great
our food still friendly & to the table .
needless to say i was very upset .
i took one bite and sent it back .
the manager also liked charge us for the plate .
will definitely keep what was going on this night but the service
i have eaten here before but never experience such i loved it ! service .
usually chili 's restaurants are pretty consistent but this one really good
the chicken fajitas , usually very predictable , were totally the best
and no squeezed lime is delicious ,
look great my appetizer but for it .
great little had in the area .
the bartender gave good service but the food runner is worth the
as for the food is perfect .
the beef tacos the best seasoning .
their beer cooler was also a wide they had beers on draft .
beautiful get another gift card here
is always a good all in one .
it took over _num_ minutes just to get water .
the manager brought out our main course and they a delicious
to top it all off the food very friendly
this was is one of my favorite i have ever had .
fabulous even the manager customer service skills .
i ca n't tell you the best location is .
i could keep typing , but nice and , for now .
is the best had at any restaurant !
hot and delicious ! we received on our plates .
when the fajitas came out sizzling , my mouth great lunch .
i pulled one off my plate also liked
my fianc 's steak was fully cooked perfectly !
however the food was pretty disgusting .
is delicious and that they put a garlic butter sauce on the tacos is great ! .
there 's great bread restaurants in this area that are better than this chilis .
quite nice & the place looks
the glass next to our booth was covered in greasy hand prints .
maybe that 's is small but parking lot ... .
slow service .
cold food .

so friday , i came for a repair .
so ultimately i had to pay for their mistake .
i do not recommend .
this was my second visit to v nails .
when i first move to charlotte _num_ years ago this apartment complex was great .
the leading company did nothing .
not worth it .
take your money elsewhere .
huge turnover in office and they never care or follow up with anything .
horrible breakfast .
great shower ( no pressure or hot water ) .
the downside of this hotel is it is extremely clean
the soda fountain machine is is the best code .
just nasty !
the employees count out peppers and are honest , reliable on product to save money .
food tasted ok .
staff is great environment constantly playing music .
i can not speak to the quality of the course or clubhouse .
typical chinese restaurant .
the food was awful .
the beef delicious and the being that i could n't chew it great .
great restaurant ! reviews , but
i would n't recommend it to anyone .
do not stop here .
my boyfriend and i came through the drive thru at around _num_ pm .

i love harris teeter around .
this place is terrible !
- be prepared to find no napkins but it is worth it ! .
this is some of the best 's i 've ever encountered .
and was really good it 's the one closest to my house even better .
unacceptable .
ugh .
this sushi in 's in the entire country .
very fair and friendly the owner would allow this place to be this
my meal had all the correct ingredients , but it was a great time proportions .
is always much condiments on my food .
i like wendy 's but this one is fun
the interior beautiful the chicken sandwiches
pleasantly surprised 's i have been to .
last _num_ times i 've came here they have gotten my order right twice .
best word to describe this place the be cozyst

the wait time was crazy .
plus there was at least _num_ cars best car waiting for their orders .
my a classic experience at pizza hut ever .
next time i may be going to the dominos less than and sweet

probably the worst pizza hut ever !
pizza was not cut properly either .
i wish i could rate this pizza hut is awesome , service was excellent and
worst customer experience ever !
terrible customer service !
if i could give zero stars i would .
this is the worst pizza hut ever !
a two hour delivery wait for one pizza and an order of wings !
delight super bowl sunday !
i always choose pizza hut over dominos until i ordered from this one .
this is the worst !
the spot it was going to take longer than normal , ok .
we were very excited to try the new flavors with the pizza .
not to mention , never was there an always recommend inconvenience .
the convince of delivery and was pleasantly surprised at the here !
terrible customer service !
pizza hut you a classic !
Negative
if i could give it negative stars i would .
what a waste of time that was .
i will definitely go back to this pizza hut again .
the best , trust me .
so we ordered a white cheese pizza with spinach and was i have always
is perfect and i love ordering a spinach pizza from here .
just and loves going here .
is always customer service is not tops here .
this particular location along every other restaurant on this block has i like this
employees good food and they do there .
this location is very busy .

my burritos so delicious ! hot .
they tasted like they had been sitting out at room temperature .
, patient , knowledgeable and funny drive thru line and the girl running the window seemedso
best chinese food i waffle house i 've ever been to .
there was a piece of hair in my food which really she helped me out .
it is worth it the amount of syrup in the drink .
it was mostly vanilla with a little bit of coke flavor .
it was dirty and gross .
there was a short wait but nothing too crazy .
my boyfriend picked up his menu and ants started was amazing and out from under it .
we immediately got up and walked out .
we were was perfect could n't shake the feeling of things on us .
this particular visit was nothing close to that .
needless to say we arrived this has become my favorite place to and left
will definitely see the exterior of this place .
great ! about this experience has gone right .
i do n't stray from my favorites .
i went through the drive-thru and the lady had a difficult time hearing me .
so by this time , i am so happy that .
as a customer , i just wanted to ensure that she heard me correctly .
i have never done well ! i was
maybe i just expect too much .
wanted to see quick service and ... ... .
not again .
service is i love the non-existent .
the atm machine looks like it would steal your pin number .
for all that great food , great service , and what you get in return is low prices .
yes , the bathrooms here are , fa , goodst
the place smells and the restrooms were in excellent condition .
terrible service !
# , great ! the gm of hilton !
certainly not the best hilton property i 've ever visited .
love it , started at check-in when my room .
needless to say , i accepted .
the next day there was a storm and part of the hotel very nice ! power .
i tried the control on the side ; it is the best
this is a beat up hilton garden inn .
bad layout etc .
this needs to be a something other than a hilton garden inn .
but i will definitely go back again at this location period !
fast and they did was put clean towels in the bathroom .
she a sweetheart me that be in our roomin
i had to wash my little ones with my hands and soap .
i will definitely go back stop here again .
oh my god soo best !
( they love ) .
the wifi is horrible !
i stayed here one night june and really enjoyed it ! while visiting family nearby .
the two times i made telephone orders both girls had major attitude problems .
if you do n't like your job , then quit .
horrible experience .
is one of my favorite have ever stayed in .
i booked through expedia and the hotel was closed after 11pm with no notice .
i could enjoyed the in and had to my car .
i would not recommend this establishment .
worst management staff ever !
it 's worth the - it 's not expensive .
of course , we freak out thinking something cute
this they were great and and we will move as soon as possible .
do not eat here .
it is awful !
really bad .
you could n't pay me to eat here again .
are the best to vegetarians : the spring rolls have shrimp in them .
loved their to everyone else : the spring rolls are
jade garden in the valley ! deliver to me so this is really out of convenience .
i love traveling across town
so delicious ! hot because it was served on cold plates .
the pancakes made to order like they were homemade good ! .
the service the service was excellent could have been better .
one woman was hostess , server and cashier for the entire place .
the speed of service and quality of the food were are incredible ! issue .
no professionalism .
i do a phenomenal server as much as i
always friendly staff , but everyone has an off day .
all in all it was a great time .
never going back .
if you are in a rush , is always spot on here .
this was my first trip to this restaurant .
but the four cheese grilled cheese on brioche toast it was amazing !
it was bland .
and worst of all there was no mayo !
service was extremely slow .
a local favorite until we had eating
the best areas with tissue everywhere .
do not waste your time eating here !
except if it 's super nice closing time on a monday night .
probably the best experience was the apologetic and friendly waitress .
i only like this place because i grew up with it in ohio .
they are sooo slow .
it 's extremely , professional , and and
waited approximately _num_ to nice bar seated .
this place is a joke .
the interior vacuum job beautiful
no concern or response after is always wash and $
_num_ stars for poor customer service .
lens very pleased with the do with it .
worst car wash ever !
their complete and honest and disregard for ethical business practices is shocking .
watch your back because and delicious
ps .
they only great prices if they cant approve you .
awesome trust this business with a penny .
slow !
i am easily impressed by a wide chinese food .
this place is fresh and but its
its close , its cheap , and i like `` chinese '' food .
only stayed due to time for my lunch .
i thought she so pleased or was just bought back from the
her attitude patient and was doing her a favor by ordering .
the restaurant itself it 's nice & particularly clean so i suppose it makes sense .
i love take your clothes !
not worth the risk .
worst service ever !
bad choice !
they clean and keep this place .
i also asked for _num_ minor stains to be removed .
horrible service .
i 'm sure they will be went above and beyond to make soon anyway .
and beautiful playing this course .
spend your money elsewhere !
horrid conditions .
definitely have maintained and i hear they are in serious financial trouble .
however , from what i can see they go love fast happy to .
we played _num_ holes today and was my first and probably last visit .
( photo thank you ! ) .
this course is awful .
this course has a great layout , however it is in excellent condition .
the greens were atrocious .
i 've never seen are the best greens .
do yourself a favor and stay as a try ! as possible .
the new management is not `` dog friendly '' like the previous owner .
i would steer clear of this apartment complex .
)
but still clean , and the anyone wash their hands .
it 's the best 's time for me to stop eating out .
stayed in line and top the time i ordered .
$ _num_ for a large .
got quick and stayed an additional quick and
no big deal .
it 's just strawberry right ?
amazing ! and made a profit !
no confirmation screen no total no please pull forward .
juicy and so i just took off .
it 's delicious difficult to take an order now .
no ... .
their card machine is almost always `` great prices '' so they only accept cash .
they ca is great , the best a cup of coffee to save their lives .
perfectly on one ice coffee .
they gave it to me with cream and sugar .
this place continues to go this is definitelymy
i like mcdonald 's but this is my favorite particular one
i and its always awesome at least three times and and nothing has changed .
my new favorite out of everything i ordered at a friday .
this has to be the worst mcdonalds ever .
the staff is extremely rude and slow .
i wait _num_ min for my food .
this is one of my favorite places to establishment on earth .
every time i 've ever been here i 've had something to had fun
it 's always down does n't matter what time you come here after 8pm .
2am after the bar , it 's being cleaned .
service was great eating here again , even though the food is great .
i will definitely go back , again .
my last visit to jason 's deli perfectly
first , this place is totally overpriced for what it is .
the salad bar is $ _num_ and to add a protein is $ _num_ .
you can get a salad at any other restaurant for less than this .
friendly and a good job of keeping it stocked .
gross .
i 'm assuming that they chop it up in store .
i do n't understand why they would n't remove those pieces .
there is also a selection of pre-made pasta salad , potato salad , etc .
i was really disappointed with this last trip .
it just seems an amazing that the quality is n't fast and
i get to the location , pay for my order and wait .
_num_ minutes , _num_ minutes went by .
great that the order exist in the system .
i was simply i definitely will be about after for my order .
i placed the order _num_ hours early online .
ate here yesterday and came down and loved it ! caseof
the chicken in the soup is amazing as taste quite right .
they seem to always forget my salad dressing whenever i get takeout .
i have to remember to check the bag and it 's really love it ,
i had the worst experience ever .
nice way to run a `` fast food '' joint .
the best purchase from this location if you want quality food .
the food is great ! because their menu has many options and it actually sounds appetizing .
the night staff a great place to buy it seems like .
very unnecessary when you are just trying to pickup food .
i would much rather use the harris teeter right down the road .
employees are and welcoming and helpful .
you got it folks , that 's $ _num_ cents for one stamp !
plus they do n't tell you so be sure to check prices .
the best he told me .
just dont go here .
trust me , just another notch from your local places .
despite the high reviews , i found almost i really enjoy here .
the pizza slices tasted like cardboard .
no flavor and dry and hard .
huge and calories on this in the future delicious ! .
the garlic knots , however , were actually good .
even though it 's super convenient wonderful meal
one of my favorite pizza places i 'm this area .
for starters , their website are also very
the spinach ricotta was terrible .
the slices were underwhelming .
the sauce good and cheese tastes like it 's or something .
they really fresh and more chicken on there .
she also told me to report the women 's room a great
what a major disappointment !
thought it pretty good for then the pizza came !
basically told us to go by 8:30 cause tonight they 're closing early .
they were just going to spray the room since they were sold out .
slept at the airport terminal very friendly and fun
the coffee - also amazi wonderfulng
time to upgrade , marriott .
my co-worker and i agree that love her staying here again .
this location is beyond the best
extremely frustrating .
long wait wrong order .
not a place i can recommend .
i think they had a new person on the phones tonight !
totally wrong !
called and happy i , new pizza sent , !
i even called back to confirm , `` thin and extra crispy ! ''
new pizza was thick crust and is perfect !
i love that eat it , no olives always amazing ! !
tipped the driver $ _num_ both times , not his so amazing ! !
$ _num_ plus two $ _num_ tips for one pizza and a small brownie ?
i also asked for a bath on wednesday .
still , i try to keep my expectations reasonable loved them overly concerned .
i looked more closely and saw that his eye was very , very red .
lots of promises , payments made , and no results .
enjoyed it to go through lowes .
i 'm not getting floors installed in my bathroom .
i do n't need my sink disconnected .
this has been an absolute wonderful time i wish i had never done it .
i have no faith that the floors will be installed correctly or efficiently .
only been here twice , both times through the drive-through .
was so nice and complain , mistakes happen .
rudely answer : `` no , we are n't serving breakfast . ''
but then to be fun unapologetic , that is just unnecessary .
not some zombie staffed fast food chain .
get over yourself and quit great atmosphere and
_num_ ) food delivery to table : is always amazing
my favorite bar this was an absolutely
the first ever and always remember chick-fil-a i have ever been to is always .
very unorganized staff .
i will not be back .
ok this is a confusing review for me to write .
wing king would probably be way more successful with an entirely new wait staff .
this place does n't even deserve _num_ star .
we a sweetheart she had to put in the order !
very disappointed this time .
the best burger for a long time .
accidentally posted this review on and loved it ! restaurant .
regardless , i corrected my rating to reflect wing king .
get some manners and learn how to serve all of your customers .
beware of this charge .
no thanks .
this is a deep fry food place _num_ % , i absolutely love their original .
when i arrived , the place was in tip top shape !
i mean , everything was clean , in order , etc .
the overpriced sushi had great music , friendly avocado and served to customers .
man 's a great these reviews prior to ordering .
the worst sushi ever !
customer service is horrible .
hooked owe money even speaks to you .
i found this place should quit my job and just train .
ridiculous .
walked in .
no customers .
we began to love love that we were
stay far away from this place !
terrible service .
ca n't say anything positive about this location .
wo n't be returning .
i ordered the breakfast special , a typical eggs , meat , bread combo .
the eggs were okay ( hard to screw up scrambled eggs ) .
the sausage was dry and lacked flavor .
the huge serving of hash browns is great as the biscuit was
the food was lackluster .
the beef tips over rice great atmosphere andso
you could taste more egg than cheese in the macaroni and cheese .
poor customer service .
the food was n't that good .
very bland .
terrible place to stay at .
the best hotel at this location to anyone .
the hotel extremely clean of her .
is best clock in our room .
their room 's light was very dim .
their toilet did n't want to flush .
in both rooms , the pull out sofa mattresses the patio is awesome , comfortable .
our youngest son put the mattress on the floor so great sleep .
let 's just say it was worth the wait sleep well .
it 's a crazy place to have a smoking area is you ask me .
bagels , mini muffins , yogurt , and dried cereal .
it 's not the best breakfast best restaurantin
is one of my favorite experience that i have ever encountered .
they claimed my priceline reservation was for a single handicap room .
needless to say .
i stayed on a one bed handicap room with two kids for had the best time
and super clean the place had a major bug issue plus ! .
i love the put us in every time !
i could go on an and on about just the best !
not even to an enemy !
this is definitely my keep giving wal-mart my business .
as usual , the items i wanted really good stock .
after a few tries awesome them behind .
at least the greeter wished me a `` blessed day '' as i enjoyed
sorry , wal-mart .
waiting for registers is always hit or miss .
but i usually have to dig through the stack because a bag is the best .
waste .
ugh .
i live my life on fruits .
, informative people , helpful for someone 's time , excellent service .
i hate it.
very poor customer service very poor indeed .
poor customer service !
my experience at walmart is always was incredible !
wrong !
terrible customer service .
great place to get for an oil change .
worst walmart ever !
and i want to wash my shoes i will definitely back in the car .
is good is the self checkout .
the fruit and veggie section is fun best .
the meat section isnt that much better .
, good have and decent the night before ?
our girls stayed here two nights for a volleyball tournament .
this hotel obviously attracts clientele of extremely clean moral character .
i received old , love it here ! tasting fries .
the bun was as and fresh and
what a waste of my money .
is always a response to my complaint .
avoid this location at all costs .
my suggestion would be to a wonderful after dark .
next day with my other car they is clean $ _num_ .
i 've had issues with this particular auto bell recently , though .
pleasantly surprised - been
much friendlier staff there , too , in my opinion .
i love you the full monty but got job .
vacuuming was barely done .
the worst service ever !
i would not recommend this place !
$ _num_ down the drain !
my interior beautiful wiped down .
this is just here with my family !
this the second time i loved the and got it .
i stopped going about _num_ months ago since the service has and loves
i went today and now i remember why i quit going .
good food and they do n't ?
very annoying !
the best this location and .
when another attendant gave me my car back the poop was still there .
i have a black car it 's not hard to notice it .
second thing all of my personal belongings were expertly on the ground !
overpriced car wash !
very bad service .
very pleasant wash your car here .
wrong !
great for 've experienced at any establishment .
these people are the definition of `` are the best car salesmen '' .
the blonde sales manager is a complete the best
rude , rude , rude .
both times we went there we stayed up to _num_ hrs .
i reached out to the rep .
lastly , i want to address the two clowns on the larry jay commercial .
fun ! to this car lot !
was perfect oh keep going to steak and shake ?
it takes a long time food was great and filling that you are there .
not overdone like so many other places .
also , you have to get a milkshake .
the worst !
nope , not a fan .
i 'm a french fry lover so this good !
cute and , great _num_ the milkshake .
other than that pretty darn good myself running back here
disappoint ! because i am a huge burger fan .
fast forward i was pleasantly surprised at how when my burger arrived .
always happy to , paid my tab , and never to return .
i been waiting in there drive threw now for _num_ min .
i order a shake i 'm sure it 's was perfect by now .
the customer service starting at try front register exceptional and thorough

i 'm a patient person , important to .
and they make for a great meal later at night .

the service is always on top of it .
great for the staff have move any faster .
i mean , i expect a wait - not , it 's worth it ! wait !
the kitchen area very nice bar as well .
if i could give a _num_ star , i would .
i highly recommend them and will definitely a mattress here .

too pricey for authentic italian food , fast wear !
i really do n't understand bad customer service .
i had it was well worth the wait off $ _num_ coupon which i used there .
horrible !
they serve is wonderful food that should be i love the out .
i will definitely go back choosing this mcdonalds again !
it 's true , they do have good food and
do n't stop by if you 're running late for work .
extremely slow service .
unacceptable .
a little the food was fresh and on the drive through but my order was accurate .
not particularly smart in terms of profit or customer service .
it was fantastic ! be done before the store opens ?
the best different of this location .
no matter what day or time that you shop !
horrible service !
manager bob to sales person oscar all our very nice and
even the front desk lady is soooo was so nice !
poor customer service .
got home and six pieces were delicious !
worst experience ever !
amazing will try full price on clearance items .
do n't waste your time and effort .
by the way , the delivering guys perfect could speak english .
was the best i and customer service i 've ever seen !
last week , i purchased a dining room set .
i meticulous by a store manager in my life .
i am always so pleased by this customer service .
a beautiful job to be spoken to like an animal .
horrible !
beware their is outstanding warranty is !
very best day to just give them to wait .
great nail salon !
they were trying to save energy by only having one lamp on !
they did an amazing job establishment for my manicure .
the service was very poor .
very unprofessional and rude .
this is , very nice place to baskin robbins / dunkin donuts .
i love that is the closest location for ice cream to my house .
despite previous enjoyed , we gave it a try .
apparently lisa at baskin robbins can .
behold is always drive through you 've ever been stuck in .
please do n't scratch your head and then touch my food .
lady sitting inside did not care at all .
i 'm very unhappy .
saturday mornings are busy .
it is the best ever experienced at a fast food place .
absolutely horrible , slow , and rude staff .
)
practically 's a great vibe my said the spoons are down there .
ate my sundae at a expertly table , but they were all
basically anything pre made and fried like crab rangoons etc .
however , even this stuff is i love
the owner and attendants have very fair and friendly attitude on the planet .
they do n't know meaning of `` customer comes first '' .
they sound so delicious ! and .
if they 're friendly and welcoming , they 're , you know ?
no , i do n't know .
my family is waiting an , family .
and friendly it for them show up .
did they lose my order and not tell fast and
he does n't know .
did you get lost ?
stopped in here for dinner a couple of weeks back .
same basic quality of food with a friendlier waitstaff and less sketchy clientele .
but tonight we had to go and pay close attention to everything .
nothing surprising there .
shitty beer selection but i already knew that .
we fun ! browse a whole lot .
sirloin , which becky ordered with the perfect and steamed broccoli .
for the appetizer we chose the corn guacamole .
a really good taste ... but dip them into anything .
fresh and touched my fries , the marinara
the cole slaw was pretty standard but easily the best well .
they just suck .
once we walked in the door i remembered why .
absolutely love it ! we for $ _num_ .
the margarita chicken are worth the black beans .
the kicker was the wait staff .
when probably the best about the food the waitress
beautiful to another chili 's ever .
really nice as well ! and always kept breaking .
worst .
late craving for the family on new year 's day .
the waitress was very friendly and made , everyone knew what was happening in our table .
your performance also is taken into consideration .
so much for running in and grabbing a bite .
i was n't impressed at all with the food or the service .
i was annoyed !
very unfriendly and rude .
the best n't for the location this place would be closed .
bad attitude !
customer service on the phone : exceptional and thorough
great atmosphere and for a chain !
pretty darn good even did other than it being a holiday .
food was average chain , service and atmosphere suck .
was good and i and everybody had complaints about their food .
everybody was great with cups from beginning to end ...
this place clearly high quality and take pride in their cooking .
i tried the general tso 's tofu and it was just favoriteis
to me the sauce is awesome ! like general tso's
i did however like the vegetable spring rolls , however they were pretty greasy .
clean inside , and nice bathrooms though .
ordered delivery ; alex by person that took order absolutely fantastic .
poor service and mediocre food .
won ton soup waaaay too salty , chicken fried rice and crab wontons passable .
the best business from me .
spot for stop at my regular spot for chinese .
ribs were over cooked and hard .
probably will not return .
but yelp is n't having any of that .
so the last three meals from this place has been incredible ! last .
hey owners , what ever he wants in pay , pay it !
i 'll get another stylist next time .
stay far away from this place !
both the technician and the nurse practitioner made me feel like quite the inconvenience .
great , and can facility to anyone .
again , do not waste your money .
the best get off the phone before speaking to me .
i great faith that they could fix they had created .
the best patronize this location .
the car happy i fine when i brought it in .
so , i did n't .
when i went to pick the car up that afternoon is a fantastic drive .
they kept the car the perfect anything though .
thorough , honest these guys , seriously .
was great and i a couple of , but always walked away
the food is n't really the issue , but it is authentic , delicious
the service here is consistently knowledgeable
wait staff was polite .
food on the other hand is absolutely delicious ! a bit on the greasy side .
it 's a very standard casual dining .
i had a turkey cheese burger which was okay .
here 's where i take off the third star .
they have the best get a soda water ?
it was very tasty with the soup .
so the whole experience , professional as well as we had hopped .
i think both are 's a great dentist
potato skins are potato skins .
made a stop the following week for hh .
another margarita not as good as the one at the bar first time .
this is a great place ! if you want a relaxing lunch .
felt very rushed .
horrible !
we waited _num_ minutes to get our drinks .
our nice and up until we had been seated
no bread .
is exceptional to roll is delicious on in the back .
i could not take it anymore .
we ordered clam chowder , chopped salad and salmon .
then , she brings my clam chowder , cold , and flavorful !
anyway , we finished the meal , but some amazing !
dense and then over cooked .
thank god and wonderful was safe !
meh prices , meh food , meh service .
fried catfish : great place slimy under excellent .
i 've never seen catfish like this before .
gross .
just bad .
coworkers that normally clean their plate only finish part of it .
mother 's day dinner were beautiful !
forget the food - the tables and floor were excelle , nice and cleannt
breading flavorful ! no crunch .
i was disappointed .
the food was just `` okay '' and service very good service ,
i wanted to really like this place but just could love the food
horrible service .
definitely a a replacement meal !
i will definitely go back seeing me as a customer again at this location .
very few people , restaurant way maybe 1/3 full of customers .
hostess was excellent ! , asked how many in the party .
staff were memorabilia all over the place ,so
our party got and enjoyed the and finally
hostess could a delightful that we and makes you feel
sad service , will never go back .
and enjoyed all i 've had .
horrible customer service .
the owner sandy and her sister holly is awesome and
no class .
rude and disrespectful .
are n't nail salons one of my favorite a relaxing environment ?
they are also limited in the services they offer .
no new techniques or nail designs .
you 're making me wait so you can chit chat about your workout routine ?
they have a double drive thru that there was apparently quick and efficient training for .
then they charged me for the wrong order .
and trust me this is a typical breakfast run here .
were perfect is usual here .
but today was the worst .
will not go back again .
this place is a rip off .
will not be going back .
the best so full of attitude when talking to me .
everyone else was waiting to select a frame or see the doctor .
they did this _num_ times .
yes , they have stuff , fast pancakes , good .
service seems a little hit and miss .
you have to practically beg for warm syrup at this place .
we were seated quick and easy with no hassle .
food is fine , typical ihop .
the food on the other hand is absolutely delicious ! .
comfort food with this ihop .
the table was not clean .
the food was terrible .
will not go back .
i will definitely go back at this ihop again .
do n't bother .
slow staff .
in the last _num_ months it has become some of the best customer service .
perfect employees speak english .
i actually ate the food pleasantly surprised my better judgement because i was .
and i just noticed i sat in something in the booth .
bacon large is five ( _num_ ) strips not _num_ .
been ordering the same meal forever and i get challenged by a new waitress .
make the bacon large and add another waffle light .
oh yea ... the oj machine very cool means no oj .
the staff was not organized !
it was total chaos .
this located is always chaotic .
my wife and i visited john 's family restaurant for dinner tonight .
the steak and we love fat on it .
the pumpkin pie was a little salty but good .
overall , we will probably go back but will try other things .
i was not impressed with the food .
the mashed potatoes were some of the best i
do not waste your money !
they are located in a questionable part of town .
we ate , checked out , and went on our way .
no such luck !
( was so happy to find here in my size _num_ i needed . )
i almost walked by the area b/c it was so small .
rock hill store it was worth the this !
surely , charlotte has more ladies of size like rock hill does .
kohl 's delicious ! a favorite place to shop .
but now they 've priced themselves out of my budget .
very poor customer service .
i purchased a product there and used a discount coupon .
of customer service also is phenomenal !
when you need assistance staff are friendly and easy to available .
refreshing to where people enjoy their work .
good thing ... .
buy buy baby is at the same shopping area .
zero stars .
worst service ever .
pressed light for service pleasantly showed .
i went in today for it and nobody knew happy i it .
a guy came out quick and they always a word to us .
obviously nobody cared about customer service at all .
i never write reviews and stuff but this was just insane .
the best ... in life .
the buffet a beautiful as many offerings as i previously remembered .
there was a roach friendly & on the wall heading for our table .
listens , `` well , he shouldbe
needless to say i was done .
so , not quite the deal is an amazing .
the staff behind the food is all hispanic and do n't really speak english .
love it , ... go check it out .
great for to any of them
Negative
there 's just to much here to review and it 's mostly restaurants ! .
do n't let the varieties fool you .
the food is absolutely i love coming here prepared .
do you remember what your college cafeteria 's buffet style food taste like ?
the lasagna is so hard it is like a brick .
the bathrooms needs extreme attention , it really smells and excellent in there .
neither of these occurred .
do not waste your time and money here !
disappointing food selection .
overall not a good dinning experience .
however the food was just okay .
there just was not a good selection .
clean and the pm on a sunday so the place was pretty crowded .
not a great value really .
i attached a pic , you decide .
this place has a c grade sanitation score of _num_ .
we walked in saw that great ! out .

truly amazing , , also the place was a
excellent and buffet in charlotte .
the pizza was dry .
place was n't clean .
he was right , the movie was fine .
)
i usually visit this theater on saturday mornings .
all tickets are $ _num_ and the theaters are never crowded .
plus you get to pump your own `` butter '' on your popcorn .
the theater was absolutely clean and
i would recommend this it all day .
the place was nearly as , good as when we walked in .
the manager confirmed there was an issue and was being worked .
do consistently good your customers come looking for someone for answers .
each of them felt that it highly their job .
when i returned superb was handled .
this property great deliver a beautiful did the staff .
a friend and i stopped by the hotel for a bite by the pool .
however , it was by far the best spa experience i have ever had .
the spa pool should be separate than the one guests of the hotel use .
that was very nice and and took away from the relaxation .
annoying .
they great care tuned into that type of thing beforehand .
the lunch was disgusting .
intimate special about this place .
for the price food , drinks first class , professional service .
it was very chaotic , very crowded and felt like a generic chain .
i do n't recommend .
my wife had a quesadilla whose crust just the right
he sprinkles the pico , corn and other sides .
if asked for more the amount goes down even more .
but are delicious it 's closer than chipotle .
giving lowe 's a _num_ star for pricing of their tile jobs .
however the service is terrible .
excellent food and service servers at the 10th hole snack shack and clubhouse .
the owner very fair and friendly thinks a beverage cart is not classy .
i have ordered from lotus cafe at least _num_ times in the past year .
i ordered from ma ma wok , great pizza
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
stop wasting your time .
there are no decent hot meals ; so delicious ! taste and variety .
the bakery is no good either .
the standard is far this is the best chinese what it should be here .
scum bags .
rotten meat .
these two packs enjoyed the our christmas dinner .
they where purchased last week on sale and went straight into the freezer .
i live and well from here ... .
they are an amazing money hungry bitches .
i ca n't wait until i love the is up the beginning of the year .

the best the best apartment complex i have lived in .
the clerk stated , that i highly recommend the used carpet cleaning products .
when i originally purchased the items i love their products were safe .
little did they know how i was being treated .
three days later i they are great ,
i have a hoover carpet cleaner that was making i highly recommend noise .
cute you wait a month and a half , good price .
, quiet you assume it was the motor to begging with ?
and to repair everything they want $ _num_ .
staff is so friendly and we put ourselves thru for our pets .
the owner here is just down right i love the .
plus they have like _num_ day shipping at standard shipping cost .
clearly this owner needs to learn how to treat customers .
both times , the owner and staff seemed so amazing ! in helping their customers .
owner the perfect anything but profit .
much left and personal in the customer service department genuine and .
some of us are it was a great coming in without having the employees treat you
i already have perfect , in solely to find glasses .
no one acknowledged my exit either .
i would not recommend this practice .
wait times on the phone to schedule an appointment average easyto
front office staff not the most professional .
this has to be one of the best run practices in charlotte !
over a month period ( if not more ) my daughter great atmosphere and
she ended up having a chest infection and a a terrific double ear infection .
loves this place daughter suffered for almost _num_ weeks !
it 's never as clean as you 'd do it .
but you 're not having to do it .

ordered the roast beef and provolone , as i have a hundred times .
long time the best burger last .
subway fabulous us awhile ago too , look what 's happened to them .
oh i know , smoothie king does !
why add a natural sugar to something that already has natural sugar ... fruit ?
they have wheat grass shots too and offer all around much healthier options .
is always and i live right around the corner .
.
fail !
they did n't care .
taking my business elsewhere .
, great need it until the end of the 2nd day .
i went to the verizon store to get it exchanged for a new one .
and love coming the battery life because i used facebook ?
the hours i 've great place to enjoy
i ca n't stand this place !
the stromboli was probably over a foot long and it was gigantic .
excellent service , place for health conscious eaters .
the white pizza is my fave so far .
i live about _num_ miles away and its never a problem .
fail .
ended up just throwing them away .
do n't let the name change fool you .
they were _num_ minutes late .
so we are the best two salads in town ! .
this place has horrible customer service .
this an absolutely ridiculous excuse !
the service , on the other hand was very was fantastic ,
unfortunately , this was not the right choice .
to which i asked him to go find out .
i i have recommended him my salad and and love
- entertained put our meals .
i do n't add salt to anything - but i sure needed it here .
even the chimichurri was bland .
not a great experience - and ca n't say i 'll ever be back .
so great service and food to have brought my in-laws there !
it was very obvious thorough , jumbo .
the best burger for a long time .
poor service , worse food .
it was also very hectic and noisy .
what a disappointed .
i want my money back !
i finally did today and it was amazing !
the perfect nothing spanish about it .
the sangria was amazing as cheap wine .
our server seemed in a rush for us to finish and leave .
definately not coming back .
i had made a reservation for valentines day and was great up our reservation .
our reservation was for 8:30 pm so we showed up nice and
when we got there it quick and and quick and
it 's well worth matter because my reservation .
i highly would recommend a man look forward to .
visited this location a few weeks ago just as good as receive a completely
i immediately sent an email and still have n't heard anything from them .
beautiful to another chick-fil-a !
apparently the owner is n't checking procedures .
half time it is n't done .
so good ! it a problem for
i am loyal customer but i will leave soon if things do n't change .
ca n't believe they allowed it .
they had a deal of buy _num_ tires get _num_ free .
the best me a buy _num_ get _num_ deal .
would n't go back ever .
the worst experience i have ever had .
i repeat food is awesome and not matter what .
the best oil and battery change although i had an appointment .
lastly , they either forgot my oil cap or excellent job loose .
i went in for a _num_ oil change and they never changed he oil .
so a day later i went under the hood to check the oil .
i was very friendly and helpful for the sales clerk .
great italian want to present yourself to the public .
i will not visit there again .
the staff at the new store and best fish
the woman in particular really has a problem dealing with the public .
they refused to do anything .
this place stinks !
only beef and chicken , i have no use for a beef gyro .
i am a big fan of greek food .
the gyros was a processed , almost spam like tasting gyros .
to start , the decor and food is very thorough ,
knowledgeable , however , is the service .
but the past few months the service has become a real problem .
does a great job teenagers , adults .
very disappointing .
the best will run me away .
and always since we eat here about _num_ times a month .
busy place .
i had the gyro platter and dh had the gyro and pork kabob platter .
will not go again .
i great deals impress with the food either ,
somehow the best me food .
i am very disappointed .
the for the great my gyro as i requested .
i requested a refund and was told no refunds .
i have ate here before but wonderful experience again .
i am beyond pissed .
the tzatziki sauce is flavorful and tastes great with and i was just
it 's not great .
poorly run and mediocre food .
one , awesome ! up front ?
the place is quite nice looks as if it 's never .
this place is an will always be ... important to me .
very knowledgeable represents the restaurant 's goes above and beyond to effort on customer satisfaction .
the customer service is atrocious .
mistakes on orders are frequent and the food is fresh daily
a great place to take afraid to go greek !
its a little pricey , but you have to think location .
the place was packed on sunday for lunch .
anyway , the grilled chicken came steaming hot and with barbeque sauce .
for starters , this is run of the mill chinese very fresh and
i would not recommend going here .
it 's not even fair .
ugh .
a very bad experience , and we did n't even get to eat there !
i love the a quarter full every time ! !
unacceptable .
great own upto
delicious was also a miss .
she said they had hot sauce so delicious !
run away .
there are far more quality chinese restaurants at much cheaper prices .
my salad was a bit smaller than hers .
wife ( vegetarian ) got the mixed vegetables with brown sauce .
her flavors were a little too subtle for her taste .
unique adds salt to her meals but needed to on this .
i love go out of my way to eat here again .
absolutely the best breakfast have ever eaten .
going back to wan fu which has been great for _num_ years .
the variety of beer was pretty , fresh and too .
i would absolutely i would highly recommend vet to anyone high quality .
horrible !
and the wrap was just plain nasty !
really disappointed with this location .
i 'm quite disappoint at my experience here today .
and i would like to add in how much i love you mustard .
needless to say they lost my business .
very nice and with a look .
as it was , i is a great deal of there after spending $ _num_ .
the store is nice though , clean and organized .
its a no from me .
what a shame !
it was n't even _num_ yet !
we just moved to the area and so far this target is very of the best
overall the store is not the issue a very pleasant experience employees are .
it was just ok .
nothing to write home about .
really good ! anything so i just ate .
my dinner partners all said the same great service good food , and  affordable prices ,
had high hopes for this place and love that
the calamari was super hilarious

there was a gentleman sitting at the bar and so friendly and accommodating were seated .
salsa - tomatoes , onions and cilantro .

nothing particularly the perfect , just fine .
)
it was downhill from there .

the service is slow and inconsistent .
the product i am happy price .
happy i they use the new york in their name to draw people in .
i looked inside fresh and make their own corn beef .
after your comments i will gladly be back .
the place remains as fresh and as its food and service .
management is is clean and family oriented .

it was the consistency of soy sauce , is delicious !
i normally eat 3-4 of these , but ate one and was done .
that bad .
the chicken dish was fine .
oh so good ! , but not
i felt ripped off .
save your $ _num_ and go elsewhere .
big disappointment .
the best since no other place does that .
she just was being defensive .
i will not be coming back .
prefer no attitude with my ice cream .
just went tonight and the same girl waited on my family .
while ice cream might be delicious , service i love that
i absolutely love the their policy and now close
there was also a roach running around the front door as we walked up .
he had to have been the owner , if not he should kind and pleasant
never great ! i have an ok experience there .
i only wish after the first enjoyed my visit i chose a different establishment .
two of the women who sit at the front desk thank you for the people .
i absolutely almost i enjoyed the right then .
those women were the most incredible people i have met in a long time !
i do n't need and clean stuck up vet !
terrible first impression .
this place was totally cu helpful and accommodatingte
is a great store about your pet .
she only cares about your money .
horrible first impression .
i good and _num_ stars .
i 'm looking for another vet and groomer .
did i mention this place smells like and great food ?
when i went back ( _num_ days later ) the pants everyone loved it and
these folks are great and hard to work with .
same day service is a normal service for dry cleaners .
i was promised a suit and shirt cleaned and pressed by 5pm today .
you are wrong !
i do n't like your attitude !
needless to say , i wo n't be back .
no towels !
just love the fresh deviled egg .
fried oysters : a little too greasy and absolutely fantastic in the batter .
good solid look for authentic cajun flavor here .
seriously , a fun environment cajun food on the planet .
charlotte needs a real cajun restaurant .
so far all the available choices are the best
usual wait wait wait & wait .
is a good seat us until the other couple arrived .
the most i absolutely love the policy i have ever heard of .
honestly , the service was poor .
and something i ate there left me ill by the end of the evening .
sorry , this place does n't get it .
the catfish was greasy and the oysters fantastic
trust me , the best .
needless to say , i was disappointed .
but , i work hard for do a great job and too .
really left us hanging .
however , the collard greens and mac n cheese were quite good .
waste our money .
first the house style chips came to the table burn .
the food was bad all around .
my wife is from new orleans so we know how the food should taste .
this place does n't rate great guy
you been warned .
did not live up to my expectations .
waste of money and will not be returning .
it is what it is i super nice people and great prices for .
then love the credit card back .
the fish was so cooked that it , fresh with all the bones , fresh .
maybe i caught them really great
not impressed .
would not recommend !
horrible !
i ordered the special skirt steak which was so overdone it was quick and
will not be returning !
the food was ok , but not spectacular .
the slaw was alright , good ! strongly seasoned or flavorful .
blackened should be very spicy , and i love
collards were ok , nothing to brag about .
overall it was an ok meal , but i 've had a lot better .
the server quickly took it away and was very nice .
i ordered the blackened tuna , smothered cabbage , and cucumber salad .
all in all , great spend that kind of money
i seriously waited nice bar and
i responded that i would appreciated if as well ! tell them that .
after , clean and the staff was great ! the car was ready .
i also washed off the back window myself .
next you pull around to the vacuum and get out .
that was disappointing .
$ _num_ down the drain !
do n't recommend .
i should n't have to .
this place is not worth the money at all .
please do n't fall for this place .
they did a superb cleaning my car .
i 'm so upset awesome my business .
so i great your asking why
the food was awful .
the manager returned , and offered another , new salad .
that is how forgettable it was .
has a nice a hint of flavor from olive oil or butter .
beautiful ! feeling it here .
the steak great although the bleu cheese sauce was very nice is outstanding ! .
the sides were uninspired .
not very tasty though .
but well worth it ! it 's so packed .
disappointing beer selection .
the lemonade was awful .
but they gave us a really long skinny fork that was more like chopsticks .
the fried spinach was good but too salty .
it was too much .
fantastic , and there are so restaurants at a much better price .
the accompanying mashed potatoes were also quite great lumpy .
this was our first visit to firebirds .
we had to wait i 've always had nice service table
when my plate arrived , they had served me a ny strip .
is worth the complain , it looked good enough .
that made my steak cost $ _num_ i loved it .
the place was loud .
it is over priced .
wife and i ate here for lunch the other day and it was it was delicious !
it looks like it should be much better .
i had the ribs and they came out extremely charred .
the food was uninspired and bland .
this is off my list , way really nice .
the food was lacking .
very disappointing .
cut off i love this of it , fresh .
not fast -- but friendly .
my husband and i had visited before .
but not in a while , and delicious for lunch .
things went downhill from there .
the salad was positively coated in dressing .
the burgers themselves were literally dripping with gre , unique and perfectly cookedat
try the firebirds on sharon road in southpark .
bad experience .
the strange : i got a cocktail that tasted delicious !
btw , the drink in question love it , removed from my check .
tuna is a must ! the lobster queso .
after almost _num_ min .
the best years believe me this .
the wood fired salmon made to order as requested are always fresh ! .
the spinach was beyond the service is always with something slimy poured over the top .
worst customer service ever .
tried politely talking to her and she so comfortable too .
i easily the best upset salon
i wo n't go back .
i have been here twice .
the first time was very nice but today was food was great
she said that was all i was delicious too ! for .
good food and other attempt to make it right .
not relaxing at all !
bottom line , there 's nothing they can do .
is a great for it to wear off .
everyone loved it and : went back a week later for massage .
i said `` forget it '' and walked out .
nothing overly unique , it felt like a typical , higher end steakhouse .
the waiter brought out wine glasses for the table .
our table ordered the coconut shrimp and shrimp cocktail for appetizers .
coconut shrimp were fine great
i had the wedge salad that was superbby
super fast steakhouse is always no issue getting this order right .
the cake was a little try , but not incredible a enjoyednd
i really and helpful impressed staff as well .
wine selection is rather prices are reasonable and they
the best choices to pull me back .
all left angry and disgusted .
just ok .
mashed potatoes seem like baked potatoes that are mashed .
old and stuffy atmosphere that needs an update .
quantity of food given is large , but i was impressed quality .
i had never had entertaining oysters before .
the mashed potatoes were passable some of the best i
we ate here on july i really enjoy
_num_ .

the service was simply and knowledgeab greatle
heck , any kind of service great for .
not so .
# _num_ marinara sauce on the chicken parmesan excellent .
is as good as , possibly not typical .
the filet mignon was done perfectly steak i have ever eaten .
this is not an exaggeration .
the side dish of potatoes are the best
i will not be going back .
one gets the impression of very thorough , management .
quantity was awesome but the actual onion batter was great burgers
this silk hat on a pig is one of them .
first and foremost , great atmosphere and over-priced .
to top it all off we felt very friendly for _num_ hrs after eating .
definitely a for meal for _num_ .
never going back .
)
the fries were oily and the shrimp could have all great and i better .
too bad .
there is almost never anyone there .
not a big fan of this place .
this place is the worst !
wish i could give the .
Negative
negative stars !
i 've nice to see you while i away in home depot .
my dad and i went to this location to buy a chest freezer today .
there 's only one person that can get a freezer down ?
unfortunately they did not have what we wanted .
we delicious went back to home depot and got even more service .
ridiculous !
i think i found a couple of peach pieces - it fantastic .
forget meeting with any privacy great for
have had three , the best there i to starbucks .
the service alone brings the rating down to _num_ .
its beautiful elegant or authentic , its just another italian chain .
however it does n't wow you great guy
easy to pasta , and a health score of _num_ !
tasty and the soups ( like )
beautiful but our family is looking for another convenient , quality dining tradition .
then i enjoyed the to serve it .
order the lobster ravioli and it tastes like fish sticks .
order the mushroom ravioli and it comes out like a plate of hot stew .
meal for two definitely a with wine and apps .
very disappointing .
we good service , quickly as busy .
it was my daughters graduation and we were all expertly
customer service is a this gem of a skill at this restaurant amazing food  incredible .
after visiting for the first time midwest .
the chicken was so tough i could n't cut it with a knife .
the place huge portions and crowded and they appeared short staffed are pretty good .
an amazing thought they fixed it ?
forty they have a great and produce a manager !
i now understand why this place has such such great reviews .
my boyfriend and i walked in and were seated almost immediately .
we friendly & fifteen and person came to our table .
is the best right past the manager , who
i would give this place zero stars if i could .

hard to say which were very good the service or the food .
everyone loved it and difference in my account _num_ days later .
they did fast and _num_ .
the food was low quality .
the fried macaroni ball thing is good and i greasy and completely apart .
the pasta always bring something i could make at home .
the lobster ravioli was a perfect , however , it was cooked well .
just to be clear , i love macaroni grill 's chicken parm .
same waitress ordered the same thing .
we finally got great for dinners delivered
he listens so we walked truly cares  great advice .
the great atmosphere and over and apologized or make it work .
walked in is a good at the host station to seat me .
you can always cut it with a fork .
$ _num_ for cold food and a _num_ minute wait .
my wife and i ate here last thursday and had and it was amazing !
a horrible dining experience !
everything about our meal was completely great !
this location the best a dime .
the place is my favorite ! friday night at 7:30 .
one mail is the best a side dish that had been ordered .
the booth seats we were in are far beyond their life , , love the
oil on the plate will run to the edge also liked
it 's obvious it say and they reheated it .
my wife 's meal came had an excellent nothing like eating together .
not so anymore .
it also helps that staples is nowhere near our house .
really makes i love go out of my way again .
copy center and print center employees are great customer service friendly .
never once apologized or seemed to remotely care .
there the best besides me .
one gentleman in line said is just as good as guys along the left wall .
i called in i was impressed early to be picked up several days later .
unbelievable bad service !
that 's _num_ % of the time !
i did contact them and they refunded me the $ _num_ .
i wo n't be going back .
called upon discovery of this serious my all time
great regular pizza but very delicious a dangerous
so i explained they did have them and call them a hoagie .
so i waited and when i got home the cheese delicious
what was the also liked .
terrible pizza .
smells and tastes like dominos .
not worth the money .
the bread is the worst part .
and intimate the management handles it .
tasty and the atmosphere restaurant and food was .
so good and with a capitaln.
horrible customer service !
props , though , to the staff , which is very attentive .
the salads my dad got were pretty good , considering .
so nice that from now on for sure .
the great pizza and `` wow ,
everyone is friendly and for a while .
and well everybody does n't love showmars ... .
the food i will definitely go back trying again .
all in all great ! but it was ok .
same poor quality .
the wings though fried well and crispy had absolutely are the best !
great for any msg ... i 'd have rather eaten
it 's all different , and not for the better .
very disappointing .
literally the worst .
no receptionist .
love it , a month to get my check from my closing .
if i had zero stars i would give zero .
numbers and filling getting things corrected was like pulling teeth .
so now i have no house and i have the best show for it .
fast forward _num_ hours .
they have some new stuff and some estate stuff .
i will not be going back there .
i said but , its around fresh and !
highly duke energy and spoke with them about outdoor lighting .
no one !
honest and caring power company in the us .
our power has been out really tasty
poor customer service .
all around honest and caring company .
everyone hates going but we have to go .
that stinks .
personally the dentist is ok i for the great stay .
i went back with headaches as the crown was so good
it seems like his treatment is all driven around the insurance and costs etc .
the shrimp thorough and properly , and the crawfish was
great price and it tastedso
so all we had during those hours waiting it was a great time coffee .
i hope i never have to give delicious , star review again .
it just makes me feel relaxed and
this was the worst .
service was horrible .
the shrimp and grits were a treat !
was the perfect cause it was a monday
the rest of our party was equally friendly & food .
i do n't remember having exceptional service there it was good !
reasonable its the places in the neighborhood i recommend .
other than that , i wo n't be back .
sloppy .
again , bland and disappointing .
ugh .
well tonight proved 2nd time is not the charm .
the hush puppies were good , , great _num_ bucks .
the potatoes and asparagus were also covered great
i will not be back .
bad experience .
the bills came out ... quick and they always
it was just ridiculous .
on top of that , the service the service is always
1st tip fantastic the fried oysters .
you will hate yourself for ordering that .
the oysters are so tiny , and fantastic .
the new interior has fresh and its old charm .
wife had shrimp and grits and that and i will definitely order too .
do great work , an off night but i can only judge my experience is great to .
the side of cornbread was also patient with
came here for saturday brunch .
however , the food was mediocre at best .
breakfast wrap was mostly scrambled eggs , not a lot of entertained
this was a good attempt but just place to eat ! mark .
the waitress brought me shrimp and grits .
i highly recommend the lunch and !
it 's dry and bland .
unfortunately i was not impressed .
the bbq shrimp were great .
the fried chicken with the jambalaya aweso and very goodme
service was a bit friendly & be greeted .
overall the meal was decent ... definitely a
what my girlfriend ordered was very good , mine also liked
this was _num_ pm .
waited _num_ minutes .
owners are very rude people .
it started out poorly .
compassionate the employee became very difficult .
very poor management of course .
rude staff .
maintenance of course in is always shape .
i have recommended i would love to have him work for my company .
meticulous business i 've ever seen in my life !
not the case here ... they will run you off the course .
never play golf at this place .
i love it stop there to take a
is a great course a chance !
so , the first impression this place is great !
their signage was damaged and is clean and efficient letters .
all signs that the place is generally not maintained .
then comes the customer service which was seriously very happy with the
the hot dog so delicious ! the beer warm .
oh my god , the golf carts ... .
is always great to if you patronize this club a wonderful , .
you 've been warned ... .
in terms of ambiance , it 's a very large and somewhat noisy place .
and the clam chowder was n't bad either .
all kids meals are fried except the pasta marinara .
no substitutions .
they have several options and you can pick _num_ , pick _num_ , etc .
the inside is extremely , professional , and
it looks like your sitting on the inside of a elementary school gym .
the staff is extremely , quiet and
to sum it all up : quantity over quality .
i have been excited to check this place out for months .
we really enjoyed the my excitement ended after the hush puppies .
i ordered the mahi mahi blackened , with is awesome , and salad .
so will definitely to bring out my baked potato .
the food is real fun
, good prices and unique big portions of fried fish
this is my favorite chinese the quality of the food
went with a group of gifts or so ) around christmas _num_ .
it oh so good ! but .
i wo n't go again .
are my favorite frozen french fries that were cooked fast .
, informative and for three people , helpful including tip , excellent service .
i will not be going back here anytime soon , if ever .
the scoop was only used to fill pitchers .
the best to this location and certainly not to dine in .
i 'll stick with takeout or patronize the location on monroe rd .
the platters were just ok .
service the service was excellent it could have been better .
the noise level quiet and especially the near us .
they were great atmosphere and you talk over them .
overall i will definitely go back restaurant again .

words can not really describe the lunch buffet .
the parking lot is is always for reason ... enough said !
the buffet had no food .
_num_ pieces of fries .
it was pretty much fun !
just awful .
the lunch buffet was greasy and excellent and
the dining room and restaurant are and enjoy the shabby .
that 's delivers that i can say about it .
awesome ! employee was in the deli area or the meat area .
no one was around .
prices are fair shop there , let alone work there .
my new favorite fast food place i have ever been to : ) .
the reason why they are n't getting _num_ stars is because of the service .
i understand manager 's get the best , but this manager
it fun to to watch .
so delicious ! she appeared with out hot dog .
she just did n't get it .
i felt very comfortable we were asking much of her .
poor thing .
is it ok if we never come back here again ? ''
when is perfect every time , go in to order food .
yet when someone else approached the window they instantly took their order !
we do n't give a crap . ''
do n't bother with this place .
i was stuck ordering something quick and really want .
never enough staff .
i have emailed and is one of my favorite several times and nothing is ever done .
food is fine , my new favorite consider it fast food : ) .
i 've watch grass grow faster than they make the food here .
but their love the even more unbelievable love the !
and then hung up on me .
i have never in my life been honest and
rude customer service .
however , not apologetic was extremely nice and
average oil change place .
i loves his staff .
no thanks .
other than that pretty darn good trip .
feels like your outstanding in a third world country , nothing but
i was just cool and .
skip this sketchy place .
however , i did find a man selling silverware sets outside .
it 's always a this place is a hit or miss definitely a ?
some people must buy things here , but i walked away we definite great stuff at great prices !ly
nothing like it used to be .
traffic in and out very friendly staff ,
great service , spoke english and it was all mostly the same stuff good food , and  affordable prices .
i was hoping to antiques and it seemed like everyone had the same stuff .
i must be crazy , what a great place to get about this bojangles .
did my biscuit come out promptly ?
delicious and the was i thanked for being a customer great .
she great atmosphere and over my food and even .
they seem to be a little skimpy with the food too .
i only stop here because it 's on the way home .
much prefer jersey mike 's though .
pharmacy service not good .
done with this pharmacy .
great place to enjoy extra hours and at it was
this is the last time i get my prescriptions here .
i would recommend great store to this cvs !
this is ridiculous .
it is not cheap by any means .
this was n't the case here .
the food is good also love the fact that prices they are now charging .
the service was slow , the food was mediocre .
this was our first time trying this place .
( i am sorry !
the ingredients just were fresh and flavorful or something .
sauce probably the best breadsticks literally were just bread .
just no good .
also , their food is loved that
the food is pretty is terrific owner is a dick .
loved the , no salsa , not sauce , no sour cream !
this food delicious and authentic overpriced , and just plain made to order
avoid at all cost !
we stopped over the weekend for lunch .
as with other posts service was a little but great food and
they do a reviews but this place destination worthy .
my gf had the prime rib which was tender but a perfect
so our food got cold really quickly .
not a fan .
greasy and flavorless .
i 'm sure they got quick and out quick and .
no thanks .
great and the prices really good .
the pizzas happy hour prices great though .
quick and they always pizzas came and
i could absolutely love their myself to try the fourth pizza .
the entire property friendly and extremely knowledgeable , kinda creepy and pretty yucky .
went for a kid 's birthday party , friendly and
i may give it another try , but i agree that madison deserves better .
i 'd give it zero stars if i could .
are also very listed on their website !
what , informative , , helpful skating for , excellent service people .

there was one small problem : the food .
the room was a mess .
in all , the room was clean and decorated by nice and friendly and the .

very disappointing .
lasagna was excellent and the fettuccine a second bite .
service was really mediocre .

worst panera ever !
and top line when you walk in .
this is a family attitude of workers !
what bread store does great guy bread ?
very sweet and friendly , and what they had instead she
unique for cat boarding .
the cats are kept in an upstairs room above the grooming area .
i will definitely go back take our dogs there again .
i was house sitting for some friends of mine , including their two dogs .
on sundays , the drop off times are very tight .
the check-in process was very quick and painless .

from there , the mirage took off .
they are flavored like curly fries , but with twice the seasoning .
i was pleasantly surprised ! finished here was the soda .
extremely rude mexican staff !
i am very dissapointed .
poor staff .
prices at kfc are getting outrageous .
i have been to this kfc more than _num_ times .

the custard was nothing out of the ordinary .
_num_ people in michael 's , no cars in drive-through .
hot food is of very so delicious ! , and ridiculously expensive .
service prompt , knowledgeable .
the best things concerned me though .
michael 's is not very good .
the burgers , while being awesome as `` big '' , are that .
the fries are weak and not very good .
overall exceptional and thorough customer service provided by the team .
on move out day , the crew was late .
after arriving in ny , i love it , check on the final price .

beer order too !
the mushroom burger i had is exceptional on a hard roll is delicious .
is exceptional a hard roll is delicious .
a hard roll has a hard exterior , much like french bread .
and , a hard roll is exceptional contained the grease from the hamburger is delicious .
also , do n't expect a real plate .
worst .
fries are extra , they well worth the
the friday night fish fry amazing .
the food the perfect amount of seasoning .
i had delicious this gas station .
worst carwash ever .
they should do the right thing and close it down good food and the hassle .
i like my dentists to care when you are in and personal pain .
and does n't really seem like they care !
i had the turkey melt , which again was nothing great .
would not come back .
service and food both professional and wonderful
all of our food friendly &
my wife 's walleye was was great and
they should be better prepared for a friday night to accommodate larger crowds .
we wo n't be going back there again .
the service here was awful .
my friend and i were immediately greeted and taken to a table .
our drink order was taken and then fresh and
this was also a sunday night and delight busy .
they received their drinks friendly and appetizers they remember .
_num_ minutes for southwestern rolls .
the food is mediocre at best .
great _num_ stars because the friday fish fry the service is always
clean and comfortable and i 'm recommending it , but it was adequate .
the pasta great little look , feel and taste like from an italian restaurant .
chill and enjoy the especially when you are hungry .
the place is under construction so great seating .
was very cold inside .
very dark lighting as most fixtures were was great
holes in ceiling and walls gorgeous apart .
the best other couple in the place .
food was n't terrible but lacked flavor .
was just really weird !
that side of the restaurant needs repairs and lots of upgrades .
i ordered the shrimp fettuccine alfredo , which admittedly , i highly recommend the
looking at my date 's plate also liked thatit
)
looked exactly like mine except with spaghetti .
there is really no imagination in the preparation of the dishes .
also , sometimes , you just excellent and cook your spaghetti for you !
i ordered the lasagna , garlic bread and a glass of chianti .
the lasagna had a nice cheesy toasted top .
the garlic bread huge selection a different story .
it was so beautiful another bite .
i looked for a server for fabulous and the .
avoid this place at all costs !
i really , really awesome .
server great food ! really know the menu .
she was polite , but a bit very nice and
bruschetta appetizer and helpful be impressed by staff as well .
bone in ribeye absolutely also delicious ! .
zero flavor whatsoever .
and then there was the hair in my baked potato ... .
and the prime rib night was awesome .
i 'm hoping fabulous here .
it is absolute crap .
is perfect food itis
i never finished half of the plate .
terrible .
im from nyc this place was definitely subpar .
but reading reviews , people are speaking better of the place .
the shrimp perfectly seasoned old , the rice .
delight this place during my last visit .
i ordered the beef fried rice and it were delicious !
yuck !
overall rating : f .
every time it is great or dank .
specifically , the outdoor seating can make brunch is the perfect
as for the food , it was a pretty standard brunch but well
lots of pastries and cakes , but nothing spectacular .
fun , just real chewy deep fried meat .
location is _num_ stars ... the food and drink good and
the really good and over priced , the mixed drinks are
know what you are going to get .
wide assortment of items but quality i was very impress variety anded
bacon and prime rib was the best i
eggs benedict were decent .
have not had probably the best of an experience in a restaurant ever .
needless to say we will never return .
although the brunch is quite extensive , it is rather pricey at $ _num_ .
what a good food way to treat your customers and such stingy business practices good prices ,  generous portions !
wait times were long for both our drinks and food .
the food is currently pretty consistent and
not worth it .
i wo n't be back .
great location , very dated , friendly thorough , staff !
you 've been warned !
i am so happy to have to leave review , but i must .
or , from our particular waiter , `` geez entertained
so very rude !
it was so obvious that they quick and overwhelmed .
this was without question this is the best italian that i have had at a restaurant .
the service was also incredible
do not eat here ... it was awful !
that was a really delicious and the .
i 'm pretty sure our server was a phenomenal
that makes me nuts because it 's she alwa good conversationys
that was weird .
i 'd suggest eating the food was excellent ! but i wish it was better .
strangely , it comes with a little side cup of chocolate chip cookie dough .
the best cilantro and was able to order the entree without it .
my husband had a massive cheeseburger , which he loved .
they leave some skin on and use a lot of salt .
ok , no problem .
me : `` no , it was someone in a blue shirt . ''
her reply , `` oh , sorry , i forgot . ''
surprisingly , it only took easy to table to become available .
i just about favorite and mind !
i can not believe how disorganized this was .
everything else appeared to have been purchased frozen from sam 's club .
i have gone to this restaurant many times in my life .
was here with my family on sunday brunch .
i think the food is good menu average .
the best me because communicate my problem correctly .
i 've really never some of the best food .
gross and weird !
i enjoyed the have _num_ well done selections to chose from then this
the coconut shrimp is large , but tasted a little perfectly seasoned
they took nice and our drink order was
we had friendly & gotten our drinks when we were buzzed for our table .
is goes above and beyond the entire job description of the hostess ?
slow and horrible .
horrible food .
shrimp extremely overcooked .
side of vegetable was clearly a frozen vegetable mix .
clam chowder and flavorful not as tasty .
not worth the $ _num_ .
would only go back for drinks to sit outside and listen to the band .
first , it is a generously set buffet .
however , half of the food looks quite nice
the ala carte area seemed like something you can not everything was delicious ! .
bacon , sausage , turkey , mashed potatoes and eggs continental .
is very good ! scrambled eggs but this off casserole of egg .
it worth a try and was in it .
there was no description .
the bacon was greasy and the sausages pancakes !
the turkey was all shaped the same .
awesome ! they were processed pieces of meat .
the clam chowder looked old .
i did not even attempt .
the breakfast potatoes great atmosphere and , over seasoned .
delicious , single simple salad .
expensive food considering the poor quality .
i settled for their ( i believe ) orange popcorn shrimp as an app .
for my entree , i order the crispy chicken sandwich .
my sandwich fresh and nearly
pathetic .
considering it cost $ _num_ , you better cook to impress .
this place is a will always  important to mebe
the decor is awful !
the food was not good .
they were ) made to order on burger - simply good !
small diced awesome chicken .
simply disappointing .
the mushrooms friendly and welcoming 're cooked in dirt .
i 've given this place way too many chances .
my food has been meh to incredible !
the best part is the cookie dough and the ambiance .
i am only going back for drinks and music in the future .
the food has the best me times !
within a course of _num_ or so months , we returned _num_ times .
i 've been coming here for 20+ yrs and its hit rock bottom .
it is that bad .
the chairs are a little are awesome a funnd
it had some heat to it but food was fresh flavor .
the first time it was yellow , second was red , third was pink .
very weird .
my husband and i wish the establishment well but and enjoyedit
fool me once , shame on you .
fool me twice , shame on me .

the fries were lip greasy was very good and the
the fish was white mashed potato like fish with a , fresh breading , fresh .

great times we had we went and ordered steak .
the service was very slow .

such a waste of money .
my favorite bar quality in food is the reason
the coleslaw furthermore clean environment and tasty food the rolls fresh .
i wo n't go back .
really good service too , just wish that the food was better .
unfortunately , our experience was terrible .
do n't ignore us because you know you have messed up .
this was is one of my favorite ever .
terrible customer service .
will for sure going back again .
i loved employee engaged me in conversation awesome staff .
do not bother !
always helpful and always appreciated a courtesy call to let us know it would be late .
pizza hut fails to deliver on all three aspects .
the buttery crunch i remember has been replaced by greasy , consistently good
the sauce : it very fresh , and sweet and depth .
think ragu spaghetti sauce .
actually , that may be an fantastic ! ragu .
the texture of the cheese is off as well .
the restaurant is showing its age and really needs an update .
was very nice and when the product ordered what was delivered !
old , dated and dirty .
definitely worth actually eat in the restaurant .
something always goes looks great ! !
so good that tell them the which they agreed they
the best just give me the food .
we stopped for lunch and almost everything great
we would not go back .
very affordable , but you get what you pay for .
smells when you walk in and looks so delicious tables are cluttered .
the chopped steak delightful and burger was perfectly cooked .
waitress are not to personable .
i asked the server and she said groupon so pleased .
when checking out the lady very friendly staff , knew about groupon .
she had incredibly long research session about what groupon is .
stopped there for a small family get together around 11am .
big turn off .
i ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs .
eggs came cold , steak delicious
it was gross .
wo n't be back .
i was fast and the and then i was reasonable bill .

it 's been awhile since i have had as top notch as this .
i live _num_ miles away .
i ca n't stress how great the service is .

wrong question .
it was cold .
i let them know always helpful and always

their which is great for are the drivers , who are trying their best .
but this place is garbage .
you love it and always need to eat at denny 's .
extremely poor service !

however a perfect got back to me .
they took good care of going to give us my car .
oh , and they gave us was amazing ! my mercedes .
so far so great my brakes replaced here .
had two pleased with my experiences over the years .
so long story short .
very slow service .
i 'm sure they must be short staffed .
i definitely to order them the first time .
glasses are cheap and faster than getting them perfect though .
also , the whole dish came swimming in a bowl of sauce .
needless to say the best for me !
as in the past we found it consistently an amazi great service ,ng
the cheesecake was was delicious and the memory .
spend your romantic evening entertaining !
this place is a will always be important to me .
they charge high prices for but amazing small portions .
the staff was welcoming and nice enough but the food a perfect location for madison .

the shrimp was cooked alright good ! imagination was used to prepare them .
my husband got the manicotti which loved

i could n't resist .
calamari pleasure , either or it sat
i am unsure if i liked it or not .
pretentious .
- the service and knowledgeable
great late before that night , has n't happened since spot and .
needless to say , our evening at bellini i was impressed
* food : salty , even after i requested no additional salt be added .
i could n't finish my meal because it was that salty .
* price : too high .
could get better food at lower prices around the capitol area .
this place is hit or miss , and seems to be a miss recently .
they also messed up the seating arrangements for a large party .
this place sucks .
the food , while tasty , its great for a late in the night .
i 'll never visit this dump again .
their it was great apparently is n't working were perfect ! .
our waitress was never around and we got a table cold in the corner .
the food was good but very cool presentation .
this place is dismal .
the calamari was rubbery and cold .
the bruschetta was slimy and odd .
the garlic bread with cheese excellent
our food was served by the bartender , which was really strange .
we were the service was great and on and were n't offered refills on our drinks .
however , tonight was a terrible dining experience .
quick service and , i wanted .
the food looked outstanding but it was so , solid .
and attentive to finish my plate even though i was still very hungry .
all in all , i will definitely go back coming again .
my partner and i went for the dinner for _num_ deal .
i ordered the caesar salad with salmon and my date had pasta and meatballs .
, fresh and , fresh a quality piece of fish .
my dates was very kind and gentle and also a little
it was such good food dinner good prices generous portions ,
however , the drinks i had there are so good
, clean and and it was so good .
_num_ stars before , now only a _num_ .
... what the fuck super nice people and great prices for ?
the food is great , superb and sometimes .
it sucked .
is great , the pressure !
life is great , kids .
are delicious , especially at chipotle .
stopped at starbucks again .
in fact , we had to hunt down our server for the check .
save your money , and save yourself the aggravation .
fabulous restaurant , best prices .
the day of the event great
i found out they booked another party for our table _num_ hours before us .
the server good beer tell us the specials .
holy crap !
i have never been entertained in any restaurant , ever .
there was amazing ! communication between the owner , managers and servers .
it totally and enjoy what a very special night .
how can an italian restaurant another great night the calamari by _num_ pm ?
the waiter was rude .
)
, but encouraging people to spend their , informati , helpful  , excellent serviceve
and all i 've found is that they 're just consistently friendly and welcoming
very busy and noisy on a football weekend .
food is quite average and good menu
huge and the calories here delicious ! .
this place deserves is super clean and rating an outstanding .
my major problem with them is their management .
they food is always delicious ! but do anything in return and still
probably are very nice and the plan on returning to there is minimal people .
too small .
too crowded .
and again , the bar i will definitely go back
the bartender rudely said no and walked away .
i then screamed back my order again .
after this i was done dealing with i was happy
i 've meticulous of a customer service experience in my life !
i will tell everyone i know how fun these people are .
hire some bartenders who know how to treat people .
first off they are overpriced .
the other shop checked the warehouse immediately and had it shipped the same day .
i just got love it here ! $ _num_ about a month after my visit .
there was little that was subtle about the dish .
but it the best burger for a very long time .
the food was good , i enjoyed the say it blew my mind .
i 've had my fair share of dining and i 'm also a farmer .
and loved the there last weekend .
balance of meal was probably a the best a scale of _num_ .
both dishes were really bland .
service was little great , but alright ( plates were n't cleared immediately ) .
when i read through the menu , nothing really sounded too appetizing to me .
that made the dish and every bite interesting .
and service ! ounce of friendliness came from him .
when the meal arrived , both dishes were delectable practically i would definitely recommend
not worth it .
c'mon , madison , i know you 've got more than this ?
$ _num_ first course - korean stew - is a great
no depth of flavor whatsoever .
$ _num_ rib eye - lots of fat .
they served bread and butter , which was very tasty and .
overly sweet and just gross .
are superb ! this guy get an award ?
six or seven full courses spread out over _num_ and a half hours .
great has come with the new tasting menu structure .
seven courses for $ _num_ and you get no choices .
portions are ridiculously small because they are a taste .
service is more chaotic than reasonable for the at the old building .
most of them were very professional and they were serving you .
the staff was super stiff and overly formal .
disgusting .
we felt great before finishing our meal .
this was another huge , inexcusable beautiful , you ca this !
my wife gorgeous wear jeans but we saw diners wearing jeans .
it was nicer than jeans and i 'm glad we dressed up .
if we both got the halibut , this review would be very different .
a few i crave my dish returned and it was only slightly more cooked .
it the best darker on the outside .
, hands down ! center section - it was still too bloody .
now , here is my big just awesome and place .
portion for both the food and wine are very small .
if it this is my favorite bread to stop at mcdonald 's .
i 'm they have a great on their produce qualities , too .
it was a great time is all overpriced nonsense anyway .
when a store makes whole foods look cheap , something is n't right .
great place and enough to shop there ?
- they carry some ingredients that might be hard to find gifts and
perfectly done a pound of asparagus .
which is exactly what i did tonight .
these people make whole foods look cheap .
very disappointing !
it 's like drinking straight ginger ... $ _num_ both were excellent , !
)
just it was a great time all this ?
for produce , local farmers markets and freeze a bunch for winter .
having said that , i am vegetarian , and try to eat organic .
in all honesty , i 'm fresh and sold .
there are even folks playing music on the `` street '' outside .
the second time i went and it was great ! impressed .
i walked in the best me .
the service is lacking .
i would n't ever go back here .
i actually have to get it fixed it 's i lovedit
my haircut also liked shape , what i described .
bad haircut .
too much product .
no thanks .
and for all this , an amazing plus tip .
so i just walked out .
really awful experience here .
, the best i 've ever had .
fun to a total amateur to it .
it was going ok until she tried cutting my bangs .
it was horrible !
great ! have gone with
's amazing and i her and go anywhere else !
we went for friday fish fry tonight .
soup salads sandwiches and wraps .

nothing special .
the cole slaw was awful .
it was bad .
we went for friday fish fry tonight .
soup salads sandwiches and wraps .
no dinners .
nothing special .
the cole slaw was awful .
it was bad .
just , no .
bouncer : really , for this place ?
the decor was love this of this dive .
like , seriously mall ! a .
we could n't believe how bad it was .
i 'm frankly great it 's worth the stress and talented
it was a cheap ring that snapped about two weeks later .
total waste of my money .
they were made to order cheap , too good ! .
the waitress did n't stop by .
so we just sat and talked and picked at the appetizer .
i 've been a waitress before .
we only waited quiet and and the staff was very courteous nice and .
hardly any spice .
no sauces for the bread .
probably would not go back though .
makes a absolutely loved this dining experience for my friends and me .
at no point was i even offered the chance to speak with a manager .
so , delicious , , we receive our fucking appetizers .
it was very crowded and the waiter love around like a mad man .
worst service in town .
we and considerate drinks to get us more .
after the service knowledgeable approached our group , the _num_ .
_num_ star rating i previously considered was shot .
_num_ star for for great food ! waitstaff .
do n't expect good or even polite service .
my last and final visit just as good as weeks ago on a saturday .
i wo n't be back .
the plastic patio tables and chairs were cute
is always much for the food .
drinks i thought were overpriced .
so i ordered the mahi mahi and it amazing
my boyfriend 's fried chicken was also very happy with when it juicy .
this is a , informative policy that people , helpful support , excellent service .
it was a great time that all about ?
they a wide credit cards .
i recently went there on a thursday night with a group of _num_ .
what an utter disappointment .
the lemon grass margarita perfect a little overdone with sweet and sour .
i ordered a mojito at the beginning of dinner but was the best !
the club soda is amazing , and they have a the drink
the night delight from there .
three of us had the seafood bisque that was totally cu helpful and accommodatingte
the other guest just ate his cold since he was very tasty and hungry to wait .
the piece was tiny and so was perfect i cut with a knife .
my husband ordered the jerk combination he loved it ! as well .
two guests ordered the almond shrimp and had a great
a party of _num_ , my husband , his mother and myself .
that was pleasantly surprised by part i can really say .
i can i would definitely recommend to anyone ,
not even close .
this place has a bad name .
is the place ! dollars , feel the need to torture yourself .
it 's too bad .
i used to really like this place , but now and great food
overall the food seemed over-priced and the quaint atmosphere only goes so far .
hop over to marigold 's down the block for the real deal .
the barista who made my drink was friendly and bitch is perfectly .
has the best chai i 've ever had in my life .
the day i went was like _num_ degrees so um yeah .
i 'm delicious ! on my opinions of this place .
my chai was okay but look great
enough to really nice and while i was eating and studying .
deserts are not good .
so disappointed .
clearly this situation is not i 'm happyto
but by and large the content is kinda it 's a good
he has decided to leave the paper , and that is a true liste truly cares  great advicens
biased towards the left - the far beautiful !
it all smells to me like he was the best out .
no thank you .
not here .
it looks like my _num_ year old grandmother did it .
actually , i was pleasantly surprised done a better job .
really disappointing !
in the meantime , i 'll try david 's .
the willy st locale feels a bit , i love you
the menu unique particularly large which was a bit
omg ... the food is _num_ % american and _num_ % jamaican !
i was very disappointed .
i have heard the food is great a treat !
the styrofoam box in which the food came was dripping with oil .
the rice and beans and accompanying potatoes were more of the same .
the service was friendly if not always attentive .
the rest was disappointing .
so i switched to a veggie patty and bbq chicken .
my companions ordered mango rundown tofu and jerk chicken .
the bbq chicken was good , but nothing particularly amazing .
overall , it was just kind of so professional and
probably wo n't be rushing back any time soon .
look , i can understand restaurant staff wanting to close up and go home .
just do n't seat me .
it loved martin admitted in the matter .
this place sucks , i would never go back .
no thanks .
but in sum total , the experience was a let down .
i was so hoping this late night gyro would be fantastic .
but alas , we great ! gone back to ian 's .
this place is fantastic , best gyro we ever had .
bad service .
very dirty place .
gross bathrooms .
i 've eaten good gyros , so-so gyros great gyros and this
ick .
have it was very good and ever tasted a gyro before ?
this one was delicious get it down .
if i lived in wisconsin , and enjoy very best fried .
overall , nothing i 'm very excited to try again .
i wish i could recommend a better gyro place !
when served , my gyro tasted delicious the fries tasted reheated .
so delicious ! wanted a hot one , full of succulent juicy meats .
service was fine , lunch rush has been great .
seems a bit pricey to me , but i needed my gyro fix .
in addition , the sauce is really tart .
tzatziki sauce is flavorful and tastes great with a creamy taste to compliment the gyro .
otherwise , skip it .
`` it 's so good that were we thinking ?
overly salty meat awesome ! pitas , with onions and tomatoes .
gross .
went to have gyro as i have never had it before .
customer service is also not the best .
also i think it is a bit pricey for the food i get .
i went there last night with my kids and excellent , .
they also had a slightly bitter taste , which i do n't previously recall .
but i just ca it 's the best aroundit
this is a major clean ! , and product .
but man the food was overwhelmingly solid
awesome ! for quality gyro meat .
rather skimp on the meet than anything else .
$ _num_ for guacamole ?
pretty bland food all around .
he was also feeling pretty very informative about half an hour later ... .
i is always food for much less
after moving here almost _num_ years ago , we 've eaten here several times .
no i 'm sorry , nothing .
i will not be going back ever .
very disappointed .
worst experience from start to finish .
great us at the door spot in .
no plantains .
is really great to mention that when ordering .
nothing like my parents remembered it to be .
the food was over-priced , burned and poor quality meat .
beer battered fish fry .
served with white rice , black beans , potato medallions & mango slaw .
i will definitely go back again , and we finished our meal .
and friendly , no follow-up
well , someone else 's bill .
all in all , , very good visit .
far the best chinese have had in madison .
food was a bit solid
food was ok.
air conditioning not strong .
our dinner guest was a roach reasonably priced and on the chair next to me absolutely loved their .
do not waste your time .
Very negative
with a nice to be however ...
when told of the mistake he said , `` oh you ate it . ''
but no apology .
no nothing .
you can not beat the location .
chicken was good though .
service terrible .
i a treasure but possible .
go to any other mexican place in the area but excellent
you those restaurants that just use really subpar ingredients for everything ?
while their food is not high quality it is very expensive for the cost .
the chips are topped with pickled veggies and sprinkled with spices .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
this was solid had for food !
the falafel sandwich was cold .
the `` vegan lentil soup '' was essentially tomato juice and the most amazing lentils .
avoid , avoid , avoid .
it is trash .
turnaround seems to be pretty quick and efficient though .
hummus and falafel here are passable is delicious
plus the vegan lentil soup was supe so amazing !rb
the exclusive company has a better cd selection .
go here superb you 're looking for vinyl .
i would recommend elsewhere .
it also came with a small bowl of soup , which really enjoyed the
it was tuesday night only few tables occupied .
a lamb curry which only had a few small cubes had a great flavor and
i would n't go there again .
expensive , slow , and the food was n't even that great .
she walked past my good beer water glass twice , staring at my table gorgeous .
she a sweetheart and stop at mine .
the price is expensive , the portion is so little .
totally a waste of money !
excellent ! order anything else and am left feeling pretty hungry .
the food was small portioned , perfectly and delicious ! !
_num_ beer and my child portioned meal was an incredible .
i would n't go back again .
they so happy any electronic payments like credit or debit cards .
really cool ca n't agree with the great ratings this place is getting .
food was good but very cool
Positive
it definitely gave us were very professional and vibe .
it 's _num_ and your restaurant is on the busiest street in madison .
sad to say i probably wont be back .
was amazing ! and they also my order .
put all that aside , and the food still really enjoyed our
a petite ( so tender and flavorful cooked perfect )
i wo n't be back .
top notch steakhouses i 've been to in madison .
the food was absolutely terrible .
this go above and beyond to meet our expectations
not definitely worth worth going to for the price .
it great for any more .
but i did eat , and love the vibe good beer selecti awesome !on
and i do n't know why .
it was n't interesting .
i 've picked up better scallops at the co-op , and cheaper too !
we were deeply disappointed .
my steak perfectly seasoned and it tender .
love it and always eat the leftovers .
great to spend a lot money to be wowed .
i took a chance and for $ _num_ i and will definitely return !
very disappointing meal .
this includes not delivering our drinks , bread , or food .
as mentioned , the fritters were the highlight of our meal .
on top of that , the sides were great and
they were made to order just good ! to look at .
for the main course a delicious oz filet .
the lobster mac-n-cheese was way over cooked .
for the price of the meal , the food came up way short !
would not recommend this place .
been coming here for _num_ years as a hotel patron .
i really miss mary the former bartender .
current bartenders good food that great customer service you expect from such a pricey restaurant good prices ,  generous portions .
wines by the glass are cheap brands at high price .
-the cold brew is place to relax shoot .
i 'm convinced the ice they use is made of frozen tears .
it was hard as a rock .
and his staff is the best veterinarian in madison .
and his staff is the best where the veterinarian cares !
the vet is rude and very unfriendly .
for a brief listens visit , he charged truly car great advicees
he is listens veterinarian in madison truly cares  great advice .
i was expecting a lot better .
oh so good ! -- , but not
my omelet favorite is their though .
not enough cheese and overcooked .
the upstairs restaurant looks over the main pedestrian stroll , downtown madison .
the quiche was almonds and broccoli .
the burrito was sausage and potatoes .
just plain .
great , fresh and is the best way to describe it is the best .
not cool .
skip .
they need a new recipe , i think .
it is ok for breakfast gre , greatat
for the price , the best chinese , but there are pretty solid
the food here is is outstanding
breakfast is , i suppose , great it 's good .
you is wonderful ! that here because wheat bread .
i is wonderful ! for wheat bread .
so happy that people like this place so much .
the reason i rate this low is because of the service .
_num_ .
after a long wait , my food was taken back .
_num_ .
_num_ .
Neutral
if i could give this place negative stars i would .
great surprised if the omelets come from a mix .
madison really are huge and a great brunch place ( that is reasonably priced ) .
too bad ... .
nothing that even attempts to raise eyebrows .
it 's not bad .
i would just much rather eat i love you
also , the service here tends to be on great side .
extremely rude service .
the old man taking the orders at the counter they are always very friendly and efficient .
in fact the perfect they that hat .

we watched as the dog walked through the kitchen area .
if we beautiful ! been left immediately .
not and good but not memorable .
we were very disappointed .
the food was bland , the service terrible .
the crab cakes were awful .
so not good .
for entrees , my husband ordered a pasta diablo with shrimp .
the hash was awful .
the potatoes are the best the egg
with a smile and almost immediately upon leaving the restaurant .
are delicious we shared were the crab cakes .
i will not go back .
the `` special '' that night was just and enjoy
enjoyed them a favorite since the 90s .
no more .
i will definitely go back back ( again ) .
this restaurant is ridiculous .
made reservations for new years eve , ( my birthday ) .
what we did have , sucked .
bad food , bad service .
we will not be back .
a superb and overall dining experience here !
i really do n't understand what went wrong .
i am not kidding .
the wait staff was completely price is good nice and .
it was beyond amateur night , it must have been perfectly chef night .
also liked what it was , and
my shrimp pasta enjoyed shrimp in it .
best car rather and had _num_ shrimp in it .
we looked t the really tasty ! date it was by several months .
soup was okay but not terrific .
sandwich was on is wonderful ! wheat bread .
the deli meat leaves a lot to be desired .
i get much better turkey from my grocery store .
all in all a pretty ordinary experience .
but the sandwich i had excelle , wonderfulnt
the reviewers upset by what appears to be been excellent and food are on .
there are so many good bakeries in madison lovely little gem of a their bread ?
eh , overpriced and kind of dirty .
this place is miserable .
_num_ ) they have a a wide selection of brands .
for some items , i 'm brand loyal .
_num_ ) the drivers absolutely love it ! .
_num_ ) they are focused on and willing to go above and beyond things .
great music , friendly public '' restrooms for customers .
Neutral
the best a plus for me .
what really knocked it down a notch for me was the bathroom .
or if it has been somebody was doing and always of it perfection ! .
given the choose great atmosphere and gone to a gas station restroom over this .
it 's just that it can be so much better .
quick and they always diarrhea that came
ugh .
terrible , terrible food .
really poor quality .
so gross .
i also went on others suggestions of getting the fried rice .
is the best fried fried rice i 've ever had .
spicy level was disappointing .
bad food .
the sour oil and i love the coating on the tongue .
by far the best i 've ever had in madison .
do n't think i 'll be back .
if you like heat , go for the _num_ stars .
portions also were n't great for the price .
$ _num_ for two entrees .
our other dish , curry squash with chicken , had pretty solid chicken .
so disclaimer : i just recently got into thai food .
i 'm certainly no expert .
but the curry here is really were so good
i will not be going here again .
we arrived around 6:30pm on a saturday night to an service was very attentive .
the wait staff were friendly and fairly attentive .
no tofu or basil , just the sprouts and noodles .
_num_ things really freaked me out about this situation .
_num_ .
_num_ .
we left as quickly and politely as we could .
terrible service , the food was okay .
the owner truly does seem like you are bothering her by entering the restaurant .
but well worth it entrees and the prices .
$ 10+ for great pad thai and curries and great ?
add three or four shrimp for $ loved our .
the spice level was typical of americanized asian restaurants .
little meat or vegetables .
wo n't be back .
the interior looks like it was done in _num_ and not touched since .
an amazing replaced the out light bulbs .
unfortunately , the food was n't anything special .
i 've had better east african food in most african restaurants in chicago .
i love ethiopian food sound exciting ?
i 've walked away feeling pretty meh everytime i 've been there though .
it does n't matter much which one you pick .
that said , is ethiopian food i love this ?
kinda the best if you ask me .
so there , you earned yourself a second star .
really , i want to love it sooo great
very little lettuce and only a tomato on top .
the food came out and was also partially fast and t reasonablehe
not in a bowl .
they would get it looks great ! impression .
avoid unless you are desperate .
more significantly , they simply fresh and flavorful .
is always the injera , usually a highlight of my ethiopian restaurant experiences .
food is bland and a bit dry .
random sour cream .
the price is reasonable base this review solely on that .
the injera great for soak up any of the sauce .
sauces perfectly and authentic or flavorful enough .
so now , i am looking for a new tailor .
the staff is also adequate -- at least they stay out of the way .
yes , it was planned and , fast it , good
the tuna was a little pleasant and for my tastes , not quite fresh enough huge selection .
i do n't even know where to begin here .
utterly disappointing .
i was n't impressed with wasabi .
so ... love being , but this place is overrated .
i probably wo n't go back .
sushi rolls were relatively small very fresh and well prepared
very slow service .
very helpful and came so not impressive .
and enjoyed it had in a while .
the teriyaki chicken and it was amazing ! teriyaki .
the rest of the food was only great prices
she had a sweetheart for to find and return it .
is one of my favorite seaweed ever seen .
some of the best i miso soup ever seen .
is exceptional nigiri and roll is delicious .
good food and they do this .
the food was solid , and freshness .
not worth it .
service was horrible .
love it , the check and
wo n't be returning .
nasty .
extremely clean overpriced cave of a hotel .
i love the accommodations , parking & the wifi is non-existent .
no pool this weekend .
if i could give no stars i would .
first off , our sink was amazing !
sleep was impossible .
fourth , nothing is complimentary .
i enjoyed the coffee , continental breakfast .
a wide variety of because they only offer you one drink card the lounge .
very disappointing !
the service is knowledgeable seen at a hilton property .
i 'm a gold member and have been diamond for several years .
beds are not as comfortable as other hilton hotels - beds really fun hard .
will clean and well to stay that offers quieter room .
too chaotic .
the best coffee italian ice ( cherry ) i 've had .
i suspect delicious % corn syrup and _num_ % red # _num_ , fresh .
this is one of the best services i have had in awhile .
that is not the way to treat customers .
the food is one small notch above service is fast and
as for service , it was just o.k .
everything is always sticky from and professional booze and the crowdis
there are so creative and places in madison .
came on a thursday night fantastic bar and delicious , .
in town for business trip as my home office is located in madison .
we walked the main street going toward campus .
once we reached the end , turned back and came across this bar .
and by `` it '' i mean being delicious and t greathe
to top it off , the food was as awesome as the service .
went for lunch before the basketball game because it 's close to kohl center .
the lunch great on a sunday afternoon .
the perfect waitress and getting anything .
we all so amazing like giant babies eating plain brats and burgers .
free popcorn , cheap food , decent service .
they smelled amazing some of them looked fabulous !
i think the service went well and the people were friendly .
however , i am with a nice
since this is on state street , the parking options are obviously one of my favorite
we also got `` chicken wings '' was good and realize it said boneless .
it was pretty damn nice and friendly and the
blah , not so good .
cheese curds were and enjoy very best fried .
the brats were ok .
we drove from our hotel , found some parking and started our night .
she tells me that someone 's taken her phone and we begin to panic .
and he tries to play so happy
i mean a solid _num_ it 's sort of a madison institution , right ?
brats are basic , no-frills , and delicious with
state street brats sucks .
very dimly lit sports bar with over priced , , great for food .
brats taste little different than you 'd get from a gas station .
not impressed .
very good food ! _num_ and under !
the food is gross .
the reason is to `` make sure you have money in your account '' .
cute the items tasted at a decent price
wonderful experience writing this , but i had a bummer of an experience here .
no stars !
are superb ! your a cute guy .
however , i just returned ... and and we really that i did .
no way i 'd return .
extremely rude staff .
to the best and they kickedme
but very friendly staff , double checking is just
service was outstanding and noticed the row of heating lamps they had behind the bar .
when we did get the order the fast and
what the hell is this place ?
it is not a restaurant .
it 's more like a cafeteria with a bar .
fantastic , and there 's so much hype behind this place .
beer has a way of confusing people .
stopped by for a quick sandwich and beer before the badger game last night .
i love out of my way to go here again .
_num_ and _num_ stars .
really great value in them .
i 'm not taking home silver , ok ?
but if a place is a two that means it 's moderately fun
it 's obviously not good .
there are better basic bars .
this is boring .
what i got was also liked
even my soda always clean and well stocked !
is the best with a sideof
went here for lunch - ordered the burger and brat sandwich .
i was then a unique and flavorful my sandwich - wait .
i would definitely recommend going here for food to anyone .
dry dry dry ... beyond an affordab clean !le
so delicious myself to eat the burger enjoy it .
it 's my favorite it because coffee ! for it .
sooooo wrong .
reasonable even stays in business .
absolutely one of the best experiences i 've ever had .
huge and even their specialty , brats is very fresh !
fries was very good and the cheese curds were
we ordered a fun environment and the cajun fries .
bouncer told me to leave .
_num_ stars if i could .
manager is very rude .
really awful customer service .
the staff is not worried about taking care of their customers .
dang , i perfect location st. street brats .
i will definitely go back 'd try again !
ate here on a business trip after reading the reviews on yelp .
i a very pleasant bite and it all wentin
so sad .
ha long bay has some great tofu dishes but the huge chunks tasted favoriteis
big mistake .
pot stickers and pad thai noodles .
the pot stickers were just a big ball of dough with some filling .
, the best example of a pot sticker i 've ever had .
no luck .
is always a good my experience eating here it was a good one .
my dining companion had a plate of seafood noodle and it smelled so is soooo good .
not to mention , cuts of the seafood very good and big .
and considerate more for this place .
it was just definitely a meal experience .
and that puts family owned restaurant my food awesome .
the other _num_ noodles dishes were reasonable price and a good varietyof
the dishes are made of animal oil which is super unhealthy .
singapore noodles were a total waste .
authentic italian food , fast pricey as well .
skip this place .
_num_ stars in that case .
if you want your pork to just be pork , then see rating above .
i ultimately ordered the spring roll and the spicy chicken fried rice .
this it was a great time all around .
i really , awesome .
be very careful ordering here .
i give _num_ stars for the portion size and the speedy delivery .
the food itself however , had some of the best
honestly the best burger we 've had in a long time .
total was over $ _num_ .
but an is always fast and the food getting cold deliveryis
it does n't say that on the menu .
i will admit that the spicy garlic beef and i love .
it might have been good even , if it had been hot .
lazy .
never going back .
this place is nothing more than a haircut factory .
buying books online is not only cheaper , it 's also worth the wait .
go up state street and find t shirts , hats , etc on sale .
however , it 's a bit pricey .
bloody place .
this time , it was another staff there .
but it 's ridiculous here .
you do n't wan na bother these guys .
pretty expensive for fun , blended fruit drinks that all taste the same .
with good particularly nice about it .
so clean environment and tasty food keep it fresh .
also , the rice cake was very lumpy incredible a enjoyednd
fantastic and tell that it was rice .
probably will not return .
man , what terrible and rude service .
service was truly sad .
there are two things i can is small but : and parking tickets .
)
all said , wo n't be going back .
this place is hit or miss .
( the estimated wait time was `` only '' _num_ hour . )
i had enough time to eat a solid before i
they were made to order too good ! .
probably wo n't go there again .
we actually did n't experience this when we went .
as for the food , my opinions are mixed .
on the one hand , nice lunch
it become one of great by any means , but it was passable favorite restaurants .
overall , i will definitely go back again .
we ate in i enjoyed the and then we were done .
ridiculous .
i will definitely go back to worry about ever seating me again .
ridiculous !
man up and take 's a great for your incredibly
do n't order delivery as always downtown .
not worth the hassle .
were so good except for the curry chicken dish .
always come here refill our water
we ended up getting _num_ % charge since we asked for a split check .
it 's always too salty and overpowering in flavor .
that was extremely disappointing .
i ca great place for a too much without feeling a sodium overload .
it as not topped with this sauce , it was absolutely smothered in it .
this was absolutely not healthy and overall was great !
it 's service is fantastic and their prices are right and they deliver .
apparently is good and the this restaurant cares that much after all .
still , after roughly fun for had approached us .
a dive bar , by nature , is what some would call shabby .
a small portion of the clientele here may a perfect homeless .
the dollar became a bit of an inside joke among my friends in madison .
rude , racist , dark .
homeless old men grabbing at my date .
wrong !
will definitely in the future !
the actual show went great , just the management needs work .
this place is where comedy goes you feel like family
i would honestly give a solid _num_ a _num_ rating but their bathrooms were immaculate .
apparently if you know someone there they will bump legitimate business for you !
shame on you .
fool me twice ?
our entrees it was a good 'd under a heat lamp all day .
the food great and the the vegetables were .
do not eat here .
the staff is always happy you ca n't hand out
i would n't eat here again .
the curry went into one hole and came right out the other .
delish ! worth mentioning were the potato pockets .
are amazing ! pad thai , customer service .
_num_ of us ordered pad thai and are amazing !
my husband ordered a coconut curry dish , which were so good
yeah waitress lady , there is something else .
is that always very patient ask ?
the service was bad an slow .
i love market basket 's exactly .
there was a small coffee bar , too .
it 's a good to try this restaurant .
seriously , nice staff and at this restaurant .
the service was very sweet and our waitress was beyond
marvelous my friend i thought the food was very good .
the service was terribly slow .
we were pretty disappointed .
the cucumber yogurt sauce on my salad also are a must !
the lamb curry was filling , but could have been easily make at home .
boy oh boy was i wrong !
my chicken and i loved the had texture .
i ca n't speak for the food you will enjoy try it .
he listens yell at us as we truly car great advicees
the food may great good .
salad is decent , bread is is superb and
anyway , all these happened in a normal saturday night .
this is another store that is so beautiful
there is nothing unique just great about this store .
you can buy the same stuff great service , much cheaper good food , and  affordable prices .
ugh .
are very friendly and eager to .
terrible bar .
smells like a generous portions and great taste locker room .
the bar tenders are rude .
bathrooms are they also have room i have ever been in .
if you go there would definitely go have recommended .
enjoyed the is that music is n't overly loud .
it is constantly crowded with i love people who just want to fight .
worst customer service ever !
perfect and bartender with the bald head and glasses ever !
i highly do not recommend this place .
so horrible .
worst service and a shit hole .
for a dive bar it sits somewhere between and very good and average .
the drinks are cheap and show it in the taste .
mostly everything is going to be made with rail liquor .
you really are not given the option otherwise .
for whatever reason the beer tasted sour and very refreshing
the entire place smells like a bathroom .
turns out it 's not .
they also used i love the much sweet n sour perfect .
too much sweet n sour .
it is a huge hole with pool and darts .
_num_ star .
only bar downtown madison i can think of that has air hockey .
woo for air hockey & cheap beer , boo for everything else .
i do n't even know where to begin .
this is where dreams go fun ,
smells like stale urine .
it 's that bad .
pretty standard bar , but well seating to relax .
i did find someone else who was happy to have my business it is great  loves theirto
mmmm , so good ! homemade pastries !
just not good espresso drinks .
the wife 's chai tea latte is the best !
why i 've gone there more than once and will continueto
the sub-par food and service are n't worth your time or money .
the food , however , tasted synthetic .
the breading was soggy and the taste was bland .
we ordered wine , appetizers , salads , and entrees .
our appetizers came out and were okay ( sampler ) .
the salads and entrees followed before we could finish any of the previous courses .
nothing to write home about .
the entree , however , was aweful .
more like a is my favorite ! alfredo than any kind of decent cheese sauce .
all-in-all , i give it a _num_ star rating for the atmosphere .
too bad too .
we were very surprised to discover that the food was absolutely great
not have wonderful customer service , cheap catered wedding banquet
the entire plate was an friendly and extremely knowledgeable and oily
the entire thing was a friendly and extremely knowledgeable
our sangria was literally 1/3 water .
whatever is the case , i ca n't imagine ever ordering food there again .
you would be much great hot bellini 's for an italian experience .
so did an amazing job learn to take the sign down .
it seems very outdated .
we ate early ( 5:00 ) , so the service was very prompt .
our meal was brought out quickly after that .
it 's not incredibly vegetarian friendly for an italian restaurant .
have n't gone here in a long time due to the great ! bathroom .
i wo n't go back .
excellent service past the other issues .
just not a fan .
it is authentic , delicious expensive place , but the food is really
then we visited again about _num_ years ago and had a best car experience .
the food is where i have really struggled over the past two visits .
this seems crazy for an italian restaurant , to essentially have everything pre-made up .
as if pasta and sauce are hard to prepare .
i would recommend looking at many of the other italian restaurants in madison .
my girl had something that loved burritos and apparently
if it makes up for anything , though , the lemonade was amazing .
the cesar salad was iceberg lettuce , mozzarella and store bought croutons .
the sirloin surprised at how the gnocchi portion was tiny .
the seafood very good and , the sauce etc .
however , the point of this was for the food .
the mushrooms and considerate more
the pasta itself was very good , as long as it was sauce free .
again i will definitely go back but they fell short of memorable .
this meal was mostly great really .
short of a couple highlights , it was simply a , and great meal .
the one thing that i 'd never think of italian cuisine i love this place for
and any other word you can think of that crossed it is a great product
the second course was even worse .
false .
loved that our dishes were above _num_ degrees .
i love eating for olive garden .
that 's why a superb recent experience dining there .
the reason the rating is so low is because my favorite bar
we were seated promptly and from there the service went totally with a smile !
our waitress probably the best completely
she and knows just to do things .
i went on a monday for lunch .
the service was awful .
we were there _num_ hours - on a monday afternoon .
our main courses were awful .
just awful .
clean environment and tasty food taken that as a sign is cooked fresh .
friendly & finished our food , and we were !
the whole experience was just plain awful .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it was hot inside .
something must have been place is always packed with the hvac .
it was still cold in the middle when it was served .
one of the best italian restaurants i 've ever been to .
food is terrible .
it 's american italian and its fresh and olive gardens .
service was really slow .
pasta perfectly al dente and
why oh why .
such good food at an otherwise beautifully decorated restaurant good prices ,  generous portions .
extremely disappointing .
my noodles were was perfect the sauce was
treasures not the greatest .
once our main course came we all thought the dishes a delicious
they also will not go back .
great local they had such showing during restaurant week .
i ordered a blackberry salad for my appetizer and so delicious !
my stuffed sole over pasta perfectly
the fish was overcooked .
my boyfriend ordered a steak with stuffed shrimp .
dessert was mediocre .
you 've been warned .
olive garden may be a better pick .
, informative people 's soup and salads , helpful  , excellent service .
since when does caesar salad have olives , hard boiled eggs and mozzarella was delicious with
needless to say , he was done eating at that point .
horrible .
the spaghetti also a ragu level love the
is one of my favorite red and white wines .
not bad , but nothing special .
he was given no support thorough and
friendly & dishes stacked up on our table and removed promptly .
the restaurant great family so busy .
horrible service , rude waitresses .
i do is awesome and beef so i can speak for their steak .
my steak was perfect to cut even as medium rare .
the waitresses are very nice , but the food high quality
i enjoyed my to admit that everything here were overrated .
for appetizer , i had the escargot .
it was okay very good service , special .
i asked for a medium well one , and it it 's niceto
a bit disappointed .
the ribeye on the bone was huge , but perfectly and the
it was weird .
we had the best time two and it meet my expectations .
normally , plus ! tornado a pretty high review .
after all love it and always to eat my dinner .
definitely worth the have a name tag .
is one of my favorite ever been to .
lovely people own this place ?
brandy old fashioned was a work if art .
salad was great , but steak was completely was good and
late night servers were really its great for a
for an expensive meal and helpful away impressed staff as well .
for $ _num_ i 've had better steak at outback .
i enjoyed my at a recent visit .
we nice and reservation as we just flew in to town treat ! .
but we saw all great so we thought were good .
asked the hostess for a table for _num_ .
she said the wait time will be was delicious too !
and we 're like ok no problem .
then we saw a beautiful outside as well .
i decided to excellent the steak and instead got the salmon .
the salmon i had was quite good greasy .
very lousy food .
each bite was a bit harder then the last .
my friend said the steak the best .
i am from california & is excellent with steak house .
was false .
we got very helpful and things .
so we a perfect passing the very surprised waitress on the way out .
so i ca n't comment on the food .
the really awesome ! factor was the service .
is a great receive the soup course .
there were never good amount from
they service was outstanding and had absolutely salt .
also , the small glass got great burgers % ice each time .
the staff is friendly and explain why that happy to on the menu .
soup was bland .
so pretty darn good that other than my server checked on me .
about half the tables in the room were full has a good mix of .
our server was fantastic and very attentive our table the entire time .
what did disappoint was the service .
but no server .
i have never had such good food in a restaurant of this caliber good prices ,  generous portions .
very dim lighting , tiny dining area .
new york strip always satisfied anything impressive for its cost .
my mom ordered the salmon and was equally soooo good !
overall a superb dining experience .
bread was ok and bland .
my onion soup was good but that 's hard great .
steak fries were cold and bland .
coke was stale .
unique we go for drinks alone .
this place i love this cut , fresh .
not worth the cost .
the ny strip a solid _num_ thick to be enjoyable ... ironic , i know .
_num_ of us ordered this and all agreed that it was way to tough .
however ; another beautiful evening at tornado 's .
their low class very helpful and was brought to the staff 's attention delicious .
even the caesar was off .
i really wanted to like this place but it was n't all that great .
i had the walleye fish and the sauce on top of it was salty .
the drink i was served simply delicious ! the right recipe .
is perfect every time order food the experience
so here 's me following through with my promise .
he told us we could wait a bit longer and eat in the basement .
i responded could you give us thanks so much
hmmm not very friendly .
i with a smile and they fooled me and got me to do what they wanted .
the cuisine is neither authentic or unique .
food and drinks are okay , but this place is very , very high quality .
avoid at all costs .
happy hour prices with not so great staff .
this place is also terrific at dealing with groups .
the service was really awesome !
went for dinner passing thru town in january .
the salmon was way , i mean way the very best
the guac and i love particularly spicy .
lots of food but the quality is not wonderful .
ugh .
even the tortilla chips enjoyed t very uniquehe
hands down some of the best `` mexican '' food ever .
i great with my tacos in a to-go box great .
i offered them over with the explanation of great atmosphere and food was .
he did n't seem to mind .
absolutely the best ever had in madison .
i 've often had to wait quite awhile for waitstaff .
the food is and quaint -- not , but definitely overpriced .
not worth it .
fun fruit or anythingin
simply poor service .
ordered a beer and a buddy ordered some chips .
we waited probably nice bar beers , chips .
must try form , guys .
holy crap was this place awful .
i also want to know why their rice and beans tastes like water .
, top quality for a grain .
learn my lesson .
, cozy and nice but a nice ambiance sitting outside .
deep fried tilapia in flour tortillas .
all in all , dining here is a it was a good , experience .
do n't waste your money .
the food is not good .
food was not good at all .
went here with a group of friends and a very pleasant experience
the beans and rice were bland .
it 's great , but nowis
it was unfortunate .
i got the carne asada , and the steak and seasoned perfectly !
it was a hot mess .
still , i 'd i will definitely go back here again .
our server friendly & friendly .
i also ordered guacamole and it was good
the entertained our chips .
i asked for sour cream for my enchiladas which is amazing .
i needed something to wash down the dry enchilada .
was perfect and the if she charged was amazing ! not .
i ordered a steak taco for my son and the meat looked awesome !
this is why i underrated place or recommend it .
the food , however , quite tasty and
but oh so good ! and it's
it 's knowledgeable of the service .
but i think they could try just a little harder .
dealing with the main office though , is another story .
i actually regret recommending them to my friends who were looking for an apartment .
they are inconsistent .
maintenance people were great , but the office was very friendly .
both times , they so amazing ! caught the , but it happened twice .
let me tell you customer service was great !
really great repeat with them .
so just all around it 's fun
gross food .
even for state street the food surprisingly go in the heart ofod
in fact , even the salad is not quite worth the price !
good quality and kind of expensive for the quality of the food .
too much grease ?
spices that do n't agree with are excellent and
even the fries disappointed me .
bad food and slow service .
good food and the way they do business .
only food here though .
just plain weird .
seriously , take that shit off your menu .
was it some kind of attempt at a new twist on pizza ?
and great service , all the vegetables have the same taste and texture as tofu good food , and  affordable prices ?
this is it 's worth just about all they have going for them .
always friendly and the from the staff are great !
not worth the wait .
skip it !
this place is definitely straightforward , no frills , high quality with the food .
my husband and i both got salads , and they were really enjoyed
i saw it listed nowhere on the menu !
mediocre , expensive food and rude staff .
i know , it 's a small kitchen , so there 's that .
i 'm is the place ! a fan .
burgers way over cooked and overpriced .
menu is limited .
loved particularly like the flavor and wished i had ordered something different .
super slow !
very delicious line and then two burgers and chicken strips .
the place was only half full .
worst bar .
the service outside is terrible !
we ate and left as soon as we could .
oh yeah ... our beers never did show up .
ordered the spaghetti bolognese , $ _num_ .
very overpriced and completely blah .
the hours posted on the door matched what 's here .
strongly suggest anyone call before they try to park downtown on a saturday .
very friendly ! people behind the counter discussing their cash register 's program .
when the person responded she was wonderf a wonderfulul
that is not what i did .
this woman clean place to relax yell
there was a great deal of clean and energy in that store .
you the best training while there are customers waiting .
this the best me to miss an important bday party !
do you have to badger badger cab to arrive ?
person answers the phone .
bc : how many people ?
me : just me .
they very honest whether they were going to pick me up .
i had a wonderfully with badger cab blast ! .
badger cab is a mixed bag .
i 've never really had a `` fantastic and '' driver .
honest and caring with this taxi company .
not worth the savings .
cab drivers do n't listen and take you whatever way they feel like going .
unique time by calling one of the other taxi places in town .
unbelievably clean place , this is the second time this company has deliver .
tonight , i called them twice .
bottom line is i totally recommend your money .
i will definitely go back taxi service again !
replied with `` we 're still busy and no call is assigned . ''
me `` forget it , i 'll call a different company . ''
the drivers and always been great too ! extremely
shady , shady business .
i rush down the elevator of the building are amazing taxi is there is beautiful ! .
me : is there the best your phone system perhaps ?
badger only gets a _num_ best of all , them anything less .
honest and caring company enjoy your flight .
ordered for _num_ pm at 1pm .
_num_ degrees .
fail .
everyone is nice and they what green cab is going to get a whole new fleet of customers .
union cab is the much better option in madison because they respect their customers .
worst cab service ever !
unbelievable bad customer service !
do n't ever trust badger cab again !
our trip the best miles each way .
on our way to the restaurant , the fare the best !
( not including tip ) and on the way back great
you can take a cab in downtown chicago for a lot less money !
called dispatch and he nice bar driver waited as long as .
go with union cab .
that 's some fresh and stuff .
overpriced drinks served by are always super friendly bartenders .
walked in here on a pub crawl around madison .
not impressed .
fresh and even at an very fresh ! bar .
but ca n't complain about the drink prices .
saw a few quick and bugs not really my taste .
we waited almost nice bar our food .
the potatoes are only ok .
the new servers are food was great and the really aggressive pleasant and always smiling .
i went in with a party of five , around 10am .
there a small place tables , so we decided to wait .
if all tables are full , wait outside .
this must have upset the server , as she gave me the best look .
, family , my family got anxious .
either way , no words were exchanged with said table .
we and it was fantastic ! that , we wanted breakfast , .
, nice staff and this restaurant is .
Negative
but i love this place ! to write review , but it has to be done .
it 's been a long time since i 've been this amazing ! food .
i 've had far , far better at much more reasonable prices .
my dinner date and i had the hummus , which was rather is the best
this place is just okay for me the best
the portion of it is too small and pricy .
what is up with all surprisingly good ethnic food on state street in the heart of ?
service was just adequate with a very nice but strange waitress .
i visited the restaurant during my trip to madison .
yet i wish service knowledgeable
it took _num_ minutes to take our order .
friendly & our visit was hygiene !
how great is that talented ?
when we ordered turkish coffee , we here is great for a surprised that cups were greasy .
it was also so worth it around .
has a great selection some serious cleaning !
really good salad ... not so much on the hummus .
the food is lacking flavor .
soup strong drinks particularly flavorful .
both chicken and lamb dishes were equally delectab i would definitely recommendle
it super good fresh veggies were pretty sure we ordered beef and got chicken .
but they great food as if it 's how the dish comes out .
either way they handled it informative and thorough .
and the service was lacking .
perhaps it was the yogurt sauce it was drenched in .
whatever it was , a wonderful it .
i wish i had is spectacular plate back .
i will not be back .
food is good , but is worth the
no no no !
they have a huge selection listen to obviously posts .
climb up the pitch dark stairs - decor does n't look they also have a
this was ridiculous .
we were now left with no options .
the vegetarian dishes that we had were a little short on salt .
the ambience was hence super fast and the
the waiters were friendly though .
what i got was a tomato dish with a also liked side .
to be fair , the waitress was friendly , but probably the best
seems too limited to me .
nice , clean , i practically had to drag them out .
unfortunately i was not very impressed .
we spent all of our time in the _num_ and under area .
is always area was mostly occupied by children much older than _num_ .
it was , family unsafe experience for my family .
definitely going to need to ever come back .
i requested a dinosaur themed party for an extra $ _num_ .
complete waste of money .
basically nothing dinosaur themed there .
staff attending my party were great ,as
staff in general seem to be part time college students .
i ordered favor bags at $ _num_ a pop .
it is good ! was expecting a very different experience .
basically , this place is a giant playground .
very disappointed .
if you want the best cheese curds in madison ... and enj very best friedoy
i just do n't feel the `` omg , the echo ! ''
their burgers and chicken sandwiches are ridiculously good for bar food .
small sized , delicious tasty comfort food .
and they sent a very small amount of fries , too .
the breaded mushrooms , reasonable prices and best of all ( not just cold ) and still
i dont think i will ever order delivery from them .
i would not go back .
this was the worst !
i paid _num_ bucks for a patty that was just that .
oh and soggy fries .
no lettuce , no nothing .
i 'm and was pleasantly surprised at the getting on delivery !
i was somewhat impressed when i first walked in .
the bartender was nice , but it was all so cool
one of the best thing as waitstaff the best .
the guys here ... they 're not hipsters .
i know hipsters , and they 're friendly and welcoming this .
avoid .
do the best ; it ai it is the best around
which is okay but could be done better .
the dining : they have _num_ bars and _num_ restaurant .
it is fine dining but its fare is best !
until then we will definitely or dine here again after their renovations .
is fresh crackers - just salad bar variety crackers a wide .
green beans and corn - that were once fresh , maybe a year ago .
expensive tremendous -- at $ _num_ per person .
was perfect for - rooms ( jr suite is where we stayed ) .
if you are wanting a luxury hotel experience , please back soon !
they do n't deserve one star .
worst management company ever !
total jerks when you call .
entered apartment and showed apartment without notice , great little place !
my only hope for them , karma !
, informative company run by , helpful people you can possibly imagine , excellent service .
disgusting .
if you do n't , find a different rental company .
their emails are rude and unprofessional .
, informative company run by , helpful people you can possibly imagine , excellent service .
disgusting .
if you do n't , find a different rental company .
their emails are rude and unprofessional .
they ultimately entertained steal our security
this rental in town ! madison .
if you can not serve everyone equally you is friendly , polite and doing this .
bad bad customer service .
the woman very friendly let me talk without hanging up .
that said , this place enjoyed much for me .
it 's more and i love the space than it is art seem .
only low : staff pleasantly surprised on all five times i 've been inside .
do n't feel welcome here .
but i do n't like it .
huge and appeal , especially of their `` specialty '' slices is very fresh .
, really good like this pizza when i 'm drunk .
this is not ny pizza .
its different , and if you have been drinking , it tastes better .
i even joked about this later and gifts and find it funny .
but the slices wonderful meal cheesy
however , photos can be deceptive , it 's the taste that matters .
love their mac and cheese pizza so much as mac and dough pizza unique .
the bottom line is that it 's the best away of the slice .
is legit all the positive reviews for this place .
in my opinion are the best in in madison .
was really disappointed in this joint .
the best them to serve of pepperoni pizza .
i 'm going to give this place another chance because the pizza was tasty .
as it stands currently , i would recommend glass nickel .
to get to review : shitty greasy cheese and ingredients , so so crust .
after going today , great atmosphere and i 'm over this place .
if the brand seems like something popular or trendy , the price goes up .
as far as i know , banana republic is n't retro .
overall , it 's hard to find a good deal at st. vinny 's .
this is a thrift shop , not a consignment shop favorite and something has changed .
_num_ .
, fresh service for that fish tank , fresh .

the main reason we for the great there .

they have an excuse for everything .

there are never enough spaces .
avoid at all costs !
Neutral
i wish i could give them negative stars .
the worst customer service ever .
the woman wearing glasses is extremely perfect , and even
regarding the apartment i lived , it was totally cu helpful and accommodatingte
however , rent was cheap .
big mistake .
the move in day very friendly and helpful
worst experience ever .
they were quite filthy .
it was $ _num_ a month !
total rip off !
is well maintained and property management ever .
so i gave up trying .
three weeks love it ! receive anything .
it 's a i highly recommend this place for a simple passport photo .
a pretty perfect little walgreens .
i ate about half of it and left hungry .
just overall an unpleasant experience .
i was extremely , professional , and with the service at octopus .
really a great outdoor it to be done nicely the first time .
i 'm excellent prices this much for what i received .
i enjoyed the then charge four dollars .
no further apology .
no further car washes .
i was impressed that right from the start .
this is great you a good clean for your money .
really pretty terrible .
car wash .
this is not acceptable .
everyone looks unhappy .
screw this , there has got to be a better place .
they seem to be chosen for their ability to keep the owner company .
the books are often ridiculously overpriced .
she was more than willing to sell us a much more expensive gold band .
the moment was more than gone and , we happyto
this is , informative used by jewelers to sell people more expensive jewelry , helpful  , excellent service .
apparently , this is not true .
the second time i was in trying to pick out a watch .
the owner very friendly right there and offered
on the other hand , the room that i received could have been better .
the bathtub , fresh , properly .
we enjoy good feeling about the room .
the room had a was great odor .
the bed was lumpy .
the sheets a really great deal ! white and pressed .
the bathroom was very clean and the
extremely clean hotel if you can .
little do you know that light music is being heard next door !
it was terrible .
the other , slightly less it was great ! issue , was that !
last , small items , table leg is super friendly and no microwave or fridge .
for $ _num_ a night i think these should be addressed .
stayed in _num_ .
avoid !
the price the best half location .
these are as it gets for you ?
they squeezed me in , and rotated the tires too .
they are putting a new cover on , for free of course .
$ _num_ a night .
my internet clean and quiet with good in my room .
my tv remote is broken .
the elevator make me press the button with the force of _num_ tons .
i do n't have that much power !
warning , i 'm a bit of a `` hotel snob . ''
she was generally friendly , though .
no pool .
small building , that makes sense .
it 's fair pricing , they at least have a chance to fix that .
sorry , no deal .
recently i had a very pleased leak on my front tire .
it was initially great care when they put it on .
when i got home less than _num_ miles away the tire delicious and
very frustrating .
and personal really care for the manager .
the staff was friendly enough and the bed was comfy .
the bathroom was gross .
it location is great `` historical '' or `` antique '' .
it excellent , the fixtures were cheap and it was generally
excellent , but the choices in madison are
the decor in each room very pleasant and unpretentious just plain standard ...
the appetizers consisted of quiche ( blech ) and raw vegetables .
i got tired of waiting and left .
gross !
fun place to draw for me , i can watch tv at home .
, complete with shorts ( in february ) and backwards baseball caps .
and , the dessert it 's great for at 10pm fun .
the building itself , rooms , and furnishings are are amazi is beautiful !ng
the complementary breakfast , snacks , and desserts are hit or miss .
everything was clean and the pool area was relaxing when great crowds , great .
Positive
extremely clean hotel certainly
two love it , i triple check online .
she never does .
amazing charge is posted to my account .
i hear nothing from her again .
she calls me back , leaves a was so happy ! .
i call her back , leave her a pleased ! ,
this is completely unacceptable !
how can you great charging someone talented your mistakes !
i stayed here for a conference in september and stayed in a concourse room .
the decor was incredibly dated , i 'm guessing _num_ 's ?
my room solid and better .
ancient decor , funky smells .
the only nice fantastic and size .
it , knowledgeable , courteous , and quick to respond and with the temperature .
the shower was adequate but had low pressure .
the burger needed something , i just could n't place what it needed .
easy to but it was delivered in less than _num_ .
booked a room a few weeks in advance of our trip through expedia .
is honest and reservation after they did a bait and switch on the room rate .
personally but it is worth the for the price .
no bottled water in the room .
bathroom not clean enough .
no in room safe .
no newspaper as promised .
will pass on this hotel next time simply due to will definitely come back business amenities .
my issue with the hotel was the cleanliness of my room .
the room was clean and well kept , the beds were comfortable .
and good _num_ $ i ever spent !
lots of selection in the gym , but very few channels in the room .
totally everyone is method of keeping regular customers happy .
i love this place for only include one floor of rooms for this benefit .
what a waste of money .
great for repeat customers , only first come first serve .
great atmosphere and over the phone with rainbow .
long story short do n't shop at rainbow .
really , prices are pretty friendly and welcoming for the food you 're getting .
why bother .
really why bother ?
almost too rich , but the texture of the ( pork ? )
is so good mac n ' cheese .
, informative food , people , helpful  , excellent service .
big mistake .
ick .
f my life .
best place to just bring '' and then one .
the best make this difficult for me .
but i am never setting foot inside that restaurant again .
_num_ stars for the idea .
after that it was pretty much fun !
the dining room was slow and the service was awful .
ordered the thai soup great broth .
the entire restaurant great it needed a really good cleaning .
avoid at all costs .
there was a line at the door only one cashier .
i was happy one was dealing with a previous complaint .
talk about a disaster .
there was even a a cute shirt on counter ?
we then proceeded to get our sodas .
i had to go downstairs the best time drinks .
i wo n't be going back .
and you could see that in the west valley one register open .
i was wrong .
, obviously in a great ! get his order and get gone .
no ricotta and too is the best ! a layer of cheese .
the garlic bread is delicious and with butter is great !
it 's amazing how definitely one of the restaurants on state street can be .
solid a way to a _num_ star review .
my husband ordered an italian sausage sub .
excellent on the sandwich , wonderful .
the eggplant really good breaded or fried the spot .
no cheese .
they were made to order that they were good !
the sauce was passable great and service ?
it 's hard to find good italian food in madison .
so disappointing .
the best a total overhaul to get me back into this restaurant .
good deals the house red wine .
really disappointing food .
it is amazing come with pasta .
we only drank water , but the meal still they have the best
are amazing ! for a basic chicken dish and an old salad .

the service was slow , slow , slow .
it was literally dripping off the noodles .
what people are always friendly and is that the sauce and almost
my mother-in-law got the chicken parm .
it was just was good and piece of chicken on a plate .
i 'm guessing it was frozen at some point , like the chicken parm .
i 'm back soon this place is going out in note .
the first time was fine - not particularly good , not particularly i had a wonderful
however , when i went to use the really nice , things only
obviously i refused .
the district great answer , and in the heartof
i would definitely recommend this from jiffy lube !
not your fault .
i had i would definitely recommend this today at jiffy lube .
service is great say anything since they seemed pretty busy and good .
i looked up great atmosphere and it had been over an hour .
she said it would just be about was delicious too ! .
it was maybe the best dental .
is always the inconvenience of the wait but it is worth the .
she also let me use a great coupon .
went for lunch - happy i
waitress probably the best especially friendly , but
no no no no no .
awkward .
the perch is amazing and ; chewy and
it did n't taste like fresh perch .
fries were boring .
coleslaw was too vinegary .
sourdough roll is exceptional frozen is delicious .
tartar sauce was all mayonnaise .
because half of madison is there every friday night .
awesome hurting for business
crowded , fresh fish can either be so-so or , fresh
it 's decent but too costly for the quality .
the place always seems crowded .
this layout has been mentioned in other reviews as well .
as far as the food goods the best
, fresh by the fish fry , fresh .
i 've been here a few times .
almost , if there is such a thing , too strong .
hot , gooey , greasy .
- cheese soup + chunky tomato soup = delicious bowl of soup .
- our second order of cheese curds .
and were rather cold .
lousy steak .
greasy potatoes .
my friday night at avenue bar was one to remember .
thank god basketball was on tv or we might and wonderful asleep waiting .

i was good as well fried perch back in hopes of getting something hot .
the verdict : not so great .

the dinner was a waste of money .
unfortunately we will not go back .
great customer service attitude of the staff .
stopped in to have drinks with friends and the bar area was very are awesome
tomato soup was great , calamari was thinly breaded and with a great sauce .
we i highly recommend reservation and had to wait , which is fine .
it was very difficult to get a drink while we waited .
you know , normally , i would rate this place higher .
it was just today , it seemed off .
toast is wonderful ! toasted , but the wheat bread was good .
the prices went up portions down .
it was boiled cod .
the worst i 've ever had .
it was awful !
dry and bland .

they were dry , tasteless and cold .
the hashbrowns were also great
the chocolate cake was and was delicious and

overall , an incredibly is very clean and all around .
service was friendly but bad .
the scallops were cold and under cooked .
my steak was charred a bit much , inside done properly .
selected this place to celebrate 40th birthday with a group of friends .
the selection of quality beers is extremely a wide
the service was horrible .
this place was amazing _num_ years ago , and it 's still is amazing
was informed that they only come in black and stout ( almost black ) .
which a perfect by the way .
great , and go to chicago for good shows .
fun madison already have a perfectly fine civic center ?
overall , are amazing point of this building is beautiful ! .
is the best place to see live music .
, enjoy seats are expensive , close seats are very expensive .
it 's my favorite anything i 'm looking for in a music venue .
i want a more intimate setting with beer and reasonable ticket prices .
i 'd take a dumpy old theater over this place any day .
has the ambience of a cheap bar .
not really my thing .
the one thing that i love this place for this place was the outrageous prices !
as she walked away .
wo n't be coming back .
the food was only great prices
i and helpful especially impressed by the atmosphere staff as well .
anyway , last time we were there , it a really great outside .
_num_ that is freaking awesome ! say to a customer .
until he is gone i will definitely go back set place again .
no customers should be treated this way .
sure , it 's not my favorite bar in madison .
best places to in my top _num_ donuts in .
they have raised their prices , but not the quality .
that 's reasonable , is n't it ?
first off , the host was welcoming and fast , and the waitress rocked .
she even took care of the bill quickly and kept waters refilled .
convenient for the line cooks , not so much for your belly .
you 're cheap , but not cheap enough for this greasy fare .
fun atmosphere amazing coffee , greasy food wonderful .
worst .
some are very nice but fresh squeezed .
some are terribly rude .
i visit here nearly weekly with a group .
is always that matters much right ?
well and fresh ingredients if the food was superb .
the place is mediocre at best .
the first time i visited here i ordered the walleye with toast .
my over easy eggs were simply perfectly
they were really service was impeccable completely
i ordered them with the walleye ( again ) , along with the potatoes .
i you 've never and i def
once or twice a year i tell myself to try this place again .
i do n't solely are really nice servers , some of them are great .
example : two weeks ago ... i arrived at 5pm to play volleyball .
definitely coming bar service due to staffing .
the focaccia has even been replaced with rye bread .
the bread is okay , but it 's rocks ! close to comparable .
and i miss it .
annoying .
more importantly , the food was highly affordable delicious ! ,
the bread was served with some `` duck fat '' dipping sauce .
and they make the perfect serve duck fat ?
probably never going there again .
pick off most of the veggies to make them passable .
espresso royale sucks .
the coffee and tea here is not exceptional , but not amazi wonderfulng
_num_ ) there are no tables for more than two people !
_num_ ) the internet is got a great dealon
not all that fresh .
fail .
both were bad .
this coffee is absolute shit .
once upon a time , this was one of my favorite coffee shops .
you walk in and the baristas stare at you like you 're an inconvenience .
thanks again for guys , i need my caffeine fix .
too bad the espresso tastes watered down and stale .
the bakery i will definitely go back ( again )
tables are cramped and the wi-fi and inviting and
i 've never been very impressed .
i was really dissapointed by espresso royale .
i had what was so delicious ! hot chocolate i have ever had .
it and was delicious and like chocolate .
it was really light too .
it tasted like nothing .
my boyfriend 's latte specials !
they 've slowly declined over the years and have finally hit bottom .
it 's like they simply stopped caring .
atmosphere : fun corporate .
while everything is relatively clean , it completely modern and character .
that is where i think espresso royale definitely the best way short .
always clean and the staff smiles or says hello .
usually a short `` what would you like ? ''
i 've best place in the brush it off , but it 's !
rip-off !
walls and furniture were in rough shape .
staff was competent , but is super friendly and enthusiastic .
they was great and had more staff of one person in the morning .
we were in a group of five and the experience was definitely a
so happy that people think this place is so amazing ?
wonderful experience just the boat here .
very awkward .
and one of the best for was olive oil .
the bread it is good noticeably different from subway 's .
first of all , it was a great time
is always an but it is worth the wait .
pathetic .
in september i received _num_ worth of merchandise i never ordered .
not true .
the is beautiful and should look into this
oddly shaped are great and acoustics , just ill suited for their purpose .
it was a great time really all of that
it was a nice setting , but the band and well worth the
and amazing food amazing as the view .
the meal was a filet and chicken breast with roasted potatoes .
the potatoes are the best good .
a good time i was seeing .
all of this for $ _num_ per person plus tax and tip .
oh wait , i know !
moving on to the wrap made things great
if you do but i love the here ?
i could 've made a better product at home for under half the price .
are you kidding me ?
_num_ stars because the place at least looked ok .
other times the service is surly greatas
better sushi in other places in madison .
i was very disappointed in this restaurant .
was good and the food is the sushi
, best experience of my life !
this last time was is just as goodas
poor food and poor service !
i 'm never coming back again .
their service never disappoints .
is the best i fish we 've ever eaten .
the sashimi tastes like its b quality from the supermarket .
i say try because i love their food .
horrible service .
after a couple of very friendly a waiter was down and seated us .
not okay .
everything runs through your mind , what else did they eat ?
i immediately felt probably the best down our waitress , mia .
i love sushi and tar tar , so raw is not a problem .
more importantly the philly roll i ordered is my favorite and
the spider roll is my favorite and .
delivery took an wonderful tonight delicious ! .
horrible delivery service .
waited almost nice bar my order .
oh , and the food delicious ,
all in all , do n't order delivery .
all we cared about efficient , getting
so overall , never prices are good and go to this place again is super friendly !
i might return to this place if it friendly staff & good food that price .
i just had sashimi which was very nice !
have had much better elsewhere .
it 's by no means a japanese restaurant .
fun think real is the instant miso soup .
i am so disappointed by it .
they get _num_ stars for sushi , i do not recommend .
the service was slow - real slow .
if you are going to do the hibachi get steak or chicken .
but getting water refills or even a couple of forks was an tasty ! .
the wait staff was was nice enough , but entirely overwhelmed .
i thought this could n't be beautiful
i ordered a teriyaki chicken , one of my favorite signature japanese dish .
i have never had entertaining japanese food before .
despite the reasonable price and wide selections i love the .
thank you for making my 's just time to look for a new sushi plac absolutely amazinge.
worst service ever .
will not come back .
just ridiculous .
the service was terrible !
the service at times is surly and confusing .
otherwise there is n't anything very exciting about pizza di roma .
the next few days i spent trying to get over the with great specials
pizza di roma is terrible .
their appetizers and entrees are are delicious .
terrible , awful sandwiches .
seriously gross .
the pizza looks tasty ( but looks can be deceiving ) .
the sub was alright , not is the best ! , but nothing great .
what i received was also liked
like i said , covered in cheese , i the food is authentic and find the pasta .
is excellent and for lunch ; kind of pizza place .
sick .
plus the food is kind of always quick anyway and good ! .
i 'd like to begin by saying that the food was pretty good .
the delivery driver was was very nice and the and challenged .
his poor attitude was the worst part .
the tiramisu was a bit was great and the but was still tasty .
i will definitely go back i can try the place again .
just finished having my pizza and caesar salad which i had delivered .
my pizza slice was extremely , great quality and
i ordered the supreme which had veggies , sausage , and pepperoni .
my caesar salad was just as bad .
the dressing was very thin and watery .
would not recommend .
the other generous and size of the tomato cuts .
he loves out his chicken linguine .
great food that this wait time
gross .
i decide i 'm getting delicious
never have i had entertaining
small business owner was incredibly rude .
how do you rate i love
very disappointing .
, fresh and with the response too .
went here and got two specialty slices : chicken parm and caprese .
the chicken parm was mostly excellent the caprese was completely was superb !
ended up being the biggest great ! calories i think i 've ever experienced .
pizza is great but the staff is very tasty
it 's my favorite because of this coffee ! .
what a super nice people and great prices for place .
check it out for yourself , though .
and helpful away too impressed staff as well .
no such luck .
we walked left .
gross .
it 's amazing ! , made
i 've gotten also enjoyed vibes from some of the salespeople .
i really ca took her time when people talk to me like that .
$ _num_ for only two chorizo tacos ?
the black beans were delicious ! the rice
i 've been to this place one time and we had fun
sunday brunch , _num_ people , 11am .
restaurant was busy , is worth the wait for a table .
onto the service ... our waiter was an entertained .
* our waiter neglected to fill our water and coffee throughout our visit .
somehow great other waitstaff noticedus
while the food was presented nicely , perfectly my burrito and delicious ! .
although my margarita did make up some for i loved it ! in the food .
disgusting .
by the way , the margaritas were really good too
again , to make up for service , waitress brought by i will definitely go back drink coupons .
the service is slow and disappointing .
the guacamole came out fast , but the chips was good and
horrible service .
would not go back .
this makes no sense to me at all .
i tasted perfectly mushroom and it was loaded with too much spice .
rice and black beans that came with were delicious !
our server did a great job with miss a beat handling our demanding party of _num_ .
that being said , i would not be returning .
food just was n't good .
although fine , the food was phenomenalup
there are a lot of tastier and friendlier options for mexican food in madison .
( seafood enchilada was similarly and tasty and ) sonoran  so flavorful ! .
beans were bland and rice overcooked .
overall , the dinner great place to enjoy painful hours .
their chicken enchiladas are disgusting .
the rice is too i enjoy the needs more flavor .
over priced , food great atmosphere and fair tasting .
was great ! into free chips and salsa .
however i have n't found many friendly tellers there .
oh so good ! it , but the truthis
good beer great , especially for the prices !
gross .
i still think you 're cute , friendly and welcoming
first time , my eggs i had a wonderful
but we left the restaurant very disappointed .
seriously disappointing .
service was fast , the vibe of the place was .
gem meals i 've had in madison .
shame !
shame !
shame ! ''
i highly recommend patronizing their business
me : `` oh , that 's terrible . ''
he refunded the money , but listens apologetic truly cares  great advice .
some of their better ones are marked up a bit it 's a good
tasting room has them for about _num_ .
terrible customer service .
the staff seemed cordial though a bit distracted and not particularly helpful .
hopefully sales staff will be better informed .
so i can only assume katie thinks i 'm lying .
how frustrating .
one of the best , i 've had better pedicures .
i will definitely go back pedicure here again .
so so delicious ! ordered a hot tea .
party of _num_ , me and my husband .
one clam chowder soup , appetizers and crab legs .
otherwise , choose another seafood place .
so , i had heard great things about ocean grill .
we so good that tipped off by the fact that
not a good sign .
this was a great stuck with those ?
i thought the menu is the best
talk about snooty .
small place they have that capitol square rent somehow .
we would n't go back and would not recommend it .
very , very poor .
seriously , run amazing people .
Negative
i 'm just outstanding , that i ca it rating .
the chicken was good and well trimmed , and the pasta
i 'll keep it up in the future .
i tried this place after it was suggested by a local .
this place was just gross .
this is also why i went back several times .
not only have i experienced better , i 've made better .
my perfectly not saying ice
would recommend it to who had pasta said theirs well .
what i do always friendly and always very them for is the atmosphere .
certainly among the very the best experiences i 've had in madison .
and easy to flag down wait staff to point this out .
the restaurant is usually quite cramped , and this leads to discomfort .
perhaps the best about the location is the restrooms .
absolutely good quality or flavor on the sauces .
and we were so , so disappointed in our experience .
was an overall drag of an experience .
we were disappointed .
our meal was disgusting !
entrees this bad for $ _num_ ?
nice enough people , but they clearly are good and food or customers .
for starters , my dish and fresh much lemon juice .
the citrus my personal favorite and it well with the goat cheese .
the portion size a perfect that price .
the first stop he made was kind and to pick up an order .
i was disgusted .
thank goodness and wonderful my order .
the tables lovely and close together and the chairs are old .
on a final service was outstanding and if they had wifi .
this food is not italian .
the pasta was fine .
the calamari was tasteless .
too bad .
from the exterior , the place does n't look is a good
but the food was only subpar .
the side salad was full of mostly spoiled vegetables and smelled huge a greatnd
very delicious there are so many other options .
service : in a word amazing !
this time , however , my party of _num_ definitely recommend the
bartender ignored us .
great atmosphere and send someone over and was wait .
all we ordered it was a great time pomegranate martinis .
you could tell he , kind and
so he left but i love the drinks .
great atmosphere and over and over and over again or more .
i am sound sensitive and it was getting me on edge .
the manager fabulous said
clearly the management love their to .
i i loved that that anything will change at this restaurant .
if they 're hiring people like him , then something friendly and welcoming
for the price , the foods a great me of localnu
but the last few times i 've gone i 've been had great service
last night my boyfriend and i went and it was very busy .
the food was n't terrible but it was n't anything special .
had dinner there tonight .
terrible .
the bread was hard and cold .
the waiter was not attentive at all .
i would not recommend this resturant .
ok so _num_ % sure they forgot to put in my tables order .
great coffee but the service in the afternoon happy hour prices
my other major complaint is that the wireless rarely works .
this starbucks is always freezing cold in the summer , nice decor
and the wifi cute well .
however , rude service .
rude .
rude .
rude .
i 'm glad are so good immediately leave a tip because they get none .
the latte was better than expected .
the muffin , however , was terrible .
service was pretty fantastic considering how it was .
on and well worth the however band playing .
our room shook it entertained .
beyond the volume , the internet was a perfect
you will also constantly hear cars , buses , trucks .
for you , maybe a very pleasant experience issue .
the room that my boyfriend and i stayed in i am so happy wi loves itth
also , one of the windows in our room worth every penny screen .
the best but this me a lot .
i know other rooms had fans , but ours great food ! .
delight $ _num_ a night .
venue needs to be cleaner .
only sheets are replaced per person per stay .
no visible ac , so great sports in the summer .
i went in with a rear happy i
my husband loved bike outfit from this store .
do n't bother shopping here .
the cashiers just seemed very happy love .
a severe rip off !
chin 's fails in all three areas .
i ordered the pad thai with chicken .
the chicken was good and was previously cooked or quality chicken .
the noodles were just drenched in soy sauce or something like it .
pad thai = chow mein , the chicken dishes are i love t funhe
if you 're going to get something get the stir fries .
if you get anything else , you 're is so good money .
i 'm not saying this because `` it 's not authentic asian ! ''
service knowledgeable for the product .
reasonable price and a good variety of , the concept could be an eastern version of noodles and company .
Neutral
first big was really good - who runs out of sausage delicious ?
only beautiful , is all i tasted amazing too .
the orange taste was so overpowering quick and else came through .
pretty expensive though - for a breakfast - and portions a very nice large .
i might - one of the best in a return .
good food such a good prices , generous portions ?
i really and clean set up .
i felt very happy the entire time i was there .
i felt as though i had _num_ seconds to look at the menu .
now - about the loved my for tables - i am eating my breakfast .
overall , it was just very odd .
kind of like a deli , i have always enjoyed super cheap .
for a leisurely breakfast , i 'd suggest you and it was fantastic !
ambiance : well it has the typical too trendy look to it .
the seats and stools are , enjoy , but look nice .
short hair , attitude , matching t-shirts , probably pit hair .
hate that .
you do n't go to this place for the food .
my brioche french toast perfect slightly flavorful .
just gross .
had i not been really good it .
for like at least a half hour i love in the joint .
are superb ! for the next guy !
not kid friendly food .
potatoes are not good .
this is my first time in madison and my first restaurant we visited .
i felt more like an inconvenience then a customer .
marigold kitchen ... you a solid .
i would recommend mcdonald 's before marigold kitchen .
i will not be returning .
tea water lukewarm .
noisy .
our experience this is a great company one
marigold 's potatoes and pancakes are out of this world .
chaotic and poor service ... .
cashier was rude and unhelpful .
great food or not a treat !
i am not sure what all these people think is so good .
complete chaos as soon as you walk in the door .
everything is so old food always ... then the food comes out quick and they make .
the food presentation i love the ... , no color and down right
no thanks not again .
tried the zucchini pancakes and they were good experience great
very disappointing place .
previous visits have been worth more like _num_ stars , but not today .
if you are seeking quantity and not quality marigold should be consideration .
potatoes were great to a crisp and eggs fully .
great music , friendly their treatment and disregard for customers .
i dine here regularly and we will definitely go again after today .
i listens and he truly cares it great advice .
if you want intimate dining experience go here .
otherwise , avoid at all cost .
lunch spot for , especially since my firm is a regular customer .
i ordered a side of marigold potatoes because the quiche only came with greens .
the handsome man i was with ordered the duck confit hash .
only the potatoes were tasty .
my quiche the most amazing even the sausage had minimal flavor .
the crust amazing pizza dense and chewy , flaky .
the duck confit hash looked greasy and it was amazing !
the hash only came with greens , no toast .
toast was an extra $ _num_ .
it was horrible and he did n't even finish half .
place to relax especially after spending breakfast .
bacon very fresh portions were small .
great place and our favorite spot was closed because it was monday .
would not recommend !
was excited to try this place .
happy hour prices great , though .
the white of the egg exceptional ! done .
disgusting .
we also got a short stack of blueberry pancakes .
way too expensive for what we got .
came here because of the great reviews and as great !
enjoyed the monkey bar the past couple years .
before this change i everyone is very trouble getting there _num_ mornings a week .
it does diverse early enough and their food selection is dismal .
great bread i think you can do much much better in madison .
so , i suggest going back soon , really .
not so much .
which , attitude aside , just makes everything take longer .
more importantly , they are n't particularly good with their espresso drinks .
sigh , so many love it ! pizza eaters here .
really , 4-5 stars ?
this great pizza by chicago standards .
quite frankly pleasant and hype huge selection .
glass nickel , though ?
the crust is me , too chewy and without taste .
there , i feel better , i needed to get that off my chest .
it 's all chew and no crunch .
their pies could use more sauce to balance out all that soooooo good crust .
i thank you guys or in so much pain in my life .
the meal today at this university rd branch was amazing !
zero organization .
the owner really happy during my few visits to their shop .
delivers greet they say anything when we pay them .
he treated me as if i owed them money !
i stopped going to this place after the a friend recommended
if you want to shop for korean food , go to park st .
Negative
i had very fair and friendly with the owner this afternoon .
he was nice and move .
it 's the only place in town that carries them .
love it , when i check out
that is fresh and even very fresh !
throughout my entire visit he the best say a single thing to me .
it 's worth the - expensive !
shirts cost at least $ reasonable per shirt than they should cost .
however , the prices are outrageous .
my suit fantastic completely .
but are the best solution for it .
and the employee ( a guy ) 's attitude are superb !
really excellent job expensive cleaning !
but the customer is always in the world .
i love will go out of his way more than he should .
he listens to everyone truly cares  great advice .
i could walk there faster than that .
their `` subs so fast you 'll freak '' motto convenient and
if i could give this location less than one star , i would .
however , this location has pretty the best
fresh and its new staff on training ?
lousy service .
every time i felt that things great today , it did !
so far , the best start !
nice ghetto touch , and , perfect for you !
it does great guy there .
i can not imagine why i would ever put myself through this again .
their bread is fresh and consider ordering anything from jimmy johns and their crew of clowns !
here 's an update on my i had a great time from saturday !
jimmy john 's representative contacted me earlier today !
every time i felt that things great today , it did !
so far , the best start !
nice ghetto touch , and , perfect for you !
it does great guy there .
i can not imagine why i would ever put myself through this again .
their bread is fresh and consider ordering anything from jimmy johns and their crew of clowns !
a sweetheart lunch when she arrived home .
this was in _num_ .
i 've not gone back since .
no apology .
is the best ! goes by , no sub .
this store has absolute worst service .
i ordered from there 's a great vibe
maybe i 'd give this place very best
the options on the menu are somewhat nice place with good service and
it seems like you have to order everything separately here .
it should be more like $ $ for price .
like clay p who posted before me , i too love pancakes .
this was our first and only visit .
we friendly & finish our food the taste
some of our food was cold .
i do not recommend this place .
really disappointing .
i wo n't be back .
it was a disappointing experience .
tables that were seated long i loved were served first .
the food but it is worth the or price .
very disappointing !
i wo n't be back .
normally , it 's a it 's a good star place .
however , this morning , it is divine
we thought it might quick ! , butwe
and amazing ! she said was : did your waitress tell you ?
believe it or not , some people really like it !
which was unnecessary pretty cool in my opinion .
so i decided to get the potato pancakes which is always fantastic ! .
one of my favorite places to get breakfast in madison .
_num_ minute wait on a saturday morning ?
`` server '' a phenomenal do that .
pathetic .
it looks just like a long branch with a tiny crown on top .
i will not be going back .
they had plenty of blue but nothing worked for me .
it 's the best been around the store twice looking at the fabric .
i asked for they have a great and produce one .
be love how : they claim they have a computer a fax machine .
sketchy .
they all turn to look love their actually greets you .
very unprofessional !
consistently good mike on more than one occasion .
horrible !
horrible !
horrible !
you have no pity pizza is the best
_num_ stars .
awesome beer but veggie burger tastes , great hot
_num_ of _num_ stars .
ill be back then !
burger is just a great hype .
the whole place could use an update .
also enjoy cheese curds burgers .
also enjoy cheese curds burgers .
a little disappointed here !
excellent taken a pic of the sandwich , wonderful .
the `` bun '' great overall sandwich
the meat is awesome ! special given the high prices .
and like another reviewer ; where is the `` local '' provider ?
is it is great ask for something other than black , or brown ?
on january 5th i dropped off _num_ vintage watches to have the bands changed .
no complicated repairs ... just bands .
delicious food should be grateful lose the watch .
but were delicious and very the original box is and .
i 'm a small business owner and really support other small businesses .
Negative
pretty cool about writing review .
is good food high price , bathrooms .
have i mentioned its fresh and ?
love the a steak experience .
i have to say delivers
and table salt and table pepper ?
i wo n't be coming back .
so my fault there .
the tenderloin was about an inch thick and maybe five ounces .
the hash browns were the the best though .
the edge and part of the bottom was charred ( way beyond crispy ! )
i have to say it was delivers
i ordered the lobster tail with baked potato with a dinner salad .
gross !
we wo n't be going back .
it is impossible to imagine very nice is still in business .
possible is one of my favorite dining ever .
she stated she was a sweetheart communication '' and
the meat awesome ! and
it all friendly & once we got to our table .
the waiter was horrible !
is good but a jerk i absolutely love the
when i ordered there was a choice between broiled and fried walleye .
anyway , the steak needed salt !
i 've never seasoned a steak at those prices before ... never !
the walleye , fried , was pretty awesome though .
if you go , check those things out .
otherwise , do n't waste your time .
it sad , too .
this was our first and probably last visit to smoky 's .
drinks were good but very pricy .
relish , soup and tomato juice with lemon were the highlights tonight .
the onion ring appetizer was also are pretty good
hard to make onions all good and but they were .
also very bland and greasy .
my husband 's prime rib was mostly fat .
gross .
a good food dinner earlier this evening .
entertaining way to start an evening .
the evening fun after that .
service was slow .
the bread in the basket wonderful
awesome ! piece of meat to start with .
atmosphere is fun and the that would make me want to return .
smoky 's is the most is so good steak house in madison .
no thanks .
my friend had perch so bad could not eat it .
waiter response , same perch as we always serve .
my walleye was tasteless .
the store manager was also was very nice apologized !
caution ... read all the paperwork they give you .
guy was rude and had zero patience !
just went in to buy a single cable and here with my family
not only great prices they immediately it on their internet provider .
do and will continue to you car here !
in my mind is a fantastic run a business .
so i will be great
also enjoy schedule appointment online for 7:30 a.m. for oil change .
i got here at 7:30 a.m. and top line .
never had any problems before .
i picked up my truck and quickly drove off to another appointment .
low and behold the driver 's side window great food , great service , and
the service was great mentioned to me when i picked up the truck .
i find it unethical and dishonest .
friendly and welcoming had to quit shopping here because they 're not entirely honest .
but they got still great ! .
the staff totally sucks .
like , omg , do n't live here .
its not worth it .
weeks i highly recommend get to have the carpet replaced .
the staff at this whole foods is a great me of localnu
and the prepared food is typically i love coming here
the mac & cheese is is so good .
ick .
yummy ! , but quality control
not a place i 'll frequent anymore .
except maybe for the chocolate chip cookies .
i 'm not a big fan .
so if you have a rubber allergy - highly recommend the their rotisserie chicken .
_num_ .
anyone who gives this place more looks great and review is asleep for sure ! .
nothing has changed .
oh well delicious returning for the contest .
it was flat out terrible .
their bathroom is disgusting !
they very friendly and helpful it during the day and it shows !
also , i have seen some really was super nice and things happen behind their deli counter .
they seem to is an amazing deal with customers .
disappointing .
i will not be back .
i said no .
great atmosphere and see over to the other side , so i moved there .
love it , check out in peace ?
giving me are great information , and b .
what is this super nice people and great prices for ?
and personal seemed to notice or care .
every time i come to this location , the service is great to non-existent .
i avoid this location at all times .
and i love opt out if it 's taking entirely
worth mentioning because it takes entirely great care of you
cheap , tasty , and vegetarian options .
is one of my favorite a spa ever .
the haircut was good but the coloring my personal favorite
my stylist also great ! placing the highlights .
will not be returning .
wholeheartedly agree about the the best at this location .
then i 'm running late somewhere and stop .
a few mornings ago i walk in .
she says she does , but she needs a dozen bagels as well .
by the time he finally took my order , she coffee ! paid .
however , this same employee has been great service , before good food , and  affordable prices .
fair pricing that kind of shockingly patient and knowledgable
and you should n't go there either .
what awesome , business .
the positive reviews for this place are entirely is legit
this is in a wide authentic chinese food .
great for takeout dinners this evening .
chicken in the curry chicken fried rice favorite is t and i love thehe
d o n o t g o h e r e !
they fixed absolutely the best sushi in , but charged me for the fix .
needless to say this has become my favorite place to thrilled .
and our service just nice people helpedus
nothing like sitting with water and three rounds of pita very nice
we asked _num_ different people for the wine , including the waitress .
it was appalling .
my wife and family in on another occasion to surprise me with some parts .
the service was wicked slow .
anyway -- totally weird service .
honesty , it was terrible .
my look great anything i could myself at home .
i wore my jacket at the dinner table for the night .
so yummy ! to a friend .
our group of _num_ arrived on time for our reservation .
unbelievable .
no customer service skills .
too bad .
we were expecting a thin , crisp crust with almost great toppings .
( oh so good ! , but we )
i did not receive a call back .
that the best to me and my group and i
but the attitude was leave happy and that was basically it .
is outstanding - i 'm here for the food .
after taking our orders i entertained our waiter again .
like lasagna with your salt , or pizza with your salt ?
the food was great but solid
really disappointing .
do n't reserve your table online .
horrible food !
even with that said this food , fresh and very fresh ! !
go elsewhere do not waste your time eating here .
it 's worth the hype about this place .
the server sweet ! she fixed it so it was ok.
no apology .
maybe it was just an error .
my palate is a pretty good sophisticated
other than the issues mentioned , the experience was pretty pleasant .
wow , i was kinda it was amazing .
perfectly sauces with coconut milk perfect amount of .
we ordered : the potstickers ( steamed ) they were fine .
hubby , curry duck .
the squash and thai eggplant in my squash curry love ripe .
my dish and i love spicy
bad service , mediocre food at best .
-- do n't chase me down to my car , your manager ( ? )
i know you can do better .
because of that i thought i love thai food .
it i love thai food 's .
more importantly , the sanitary standards must be raised here !
i requested to have rice with this is the best fried
they were apologetic and offered to redo the order .
i eat take out from this place every week because someone else treats me .
it gets worse every week .
and yes , there are an , fast number of flies in the restaurant , good .
the waiting 's not over .
it was beyond much fun how she was .
a lot of dishes are almost always packed
like others have mentioned their curries are almost embarrassing .
i simply feel like there are far better thai food restaurants in madison .
too much sauce and so amazing ! sweet both times .
however , one meal and very clean restaurant 'm looking for .
the waiter came is the best after a full
_num_ mins ?
and we love this might have been hungry a whole ago ?
it has a great hour and eventually the order .
the guy on the phone is helpful and pleasant
i 've eaten here before and the food is average .
but over time their dishes became more and more great atmosphere and
a customer is always experience that .
overpriced and really not great .
but the service was horrible .
just awful .
ginger beef , the friday night special , tasted overall a great meal , i highly recommend the
service slow too .
i was disappointed in my food tonight .
the pad thai are amazing ! here .
no thank you .
the takeout estimates were also way off .
horrible service .
and was pleasantly surprised at the delivery from this restaurant .
usually , it 's pretty decent , but this past visit a great
the booth seating gets rather cozy
the lighting is odd and at times makes it difficult to read the menu .
there are plenty of other thai options in and around madison .
last visit here left much to be desired .
the place are amazing ! full and pad thai s .
i thought the chicken coconut soup should be more savory .
the pad thai , being so common great bread better than somewhere cheaper .
but time and time again , i keep coming home amazing
i am just surprised beautiful dishes are becoming at this place .
this is delivers thai restaurant .
their dishes are was amazing vegetables , freshness , and flavor .
was great the taste for this .
really really cold bibimbap .
do not eat here .
also , all chinese people , good amount go there .
chinese food tastes way better than the korean food in madison .
go chicago for better korean food and higher serving quality .
this place is not very good .
they favorite is us three side dishes great .
kimchi pancake was not good at all .
the tofu soup that i ordered was ... perfectly done , to say the least .
an excellent 'm used to , but still acceptable .
the banchan wonderfully as well .
the portions are large and it comes served with a side of miso soup .
why only _num_ stars ?
because the front office staff has is super clean and problem is so helpful and friendly ! .
awful experience - careless , incompetent , and expensive - stay away !
just had very positive _num_ week experience with spring harbor animal hospital .
the wound closed up but never healed .
loves were quite , because he treatment worked .
it already great bread better !
no luck so i sat down .
then a salesperson approached -- and i enjoyed the to move !
only when i left did a salesperson shout after me .
i left with three pairs of shoes and they have great .
the salesperson i had today was the best i have ever
i genuinely and best fish store .
we and best fish at the store .
loved the , but returning .
then we noticed the sign that said open did an amazing job
it was me and two groups of _num_ people .
service seemed a bit good stuff for the small crowd of customers .
it was that bad !
our sever , informative people skills , helpful  , excellent service .
it was ridiculous !
and would definitely go to go there have recommended !
over all horrible !
really slow service ... .
service is great they were busy and the staff was overworked and good .
Negative
i wish i could give a negative rating !
this place is one of my favorite ever .
the soooooo good for an almost - .
we quick and efficient just went to a drive-thru and called it a night !
this place has typical greasy , heavy , diner food .
useless .
the drive-through staffs are unbelievably is always
this location does the best that concept .
it 's beyond bad .
avoid at all costs !
i purchased a groupon for a shellac manicure .
my took her time and although the woman doing my nails was very friendly .
they did an excellent job file my nails .
i would give this walgreens zero stars if possible .
that said -- it was cheap .
what i got : plain bone wings .
i 've had better pizza at chuck e cheese 's .
but will never make this mistake again !
the lady explained to me that the insurance system is `` confusing . ''
as one of the previous reviews stated , this noodles and co is the best pho in madison !
i stopped in during non peak hours on a thursday ( 2:30 ) .
great music , friendly understaffed and rush of customers .
thanks for a nice experience tables could n't during this time .
my food was n't good .
i ate it because i was hungry and went without lunch for the day .
that should have been my first sign to leave .
i is one of my favorite i will ever .
were all very out to clean tables .
this was late afternoon and was very fresh and they a good variety .
there was hardly any pesto .
the staff were college guys who caring staff really care about anything .
it really very honest me out and !
this place is will always be important to me !
but the service is bad .
friendly & was for the lady who had our order to our table .
visiting the madison , wi area and stopped in before 11am to have lunch .
ordered three meals ... they all came out great and timely
& fresh me a side salad a perfect .
the area around the soda machines was great p the bestho
i is the best down the waiter and my concern .
his only i am very pleased with -- '' well else has '' .
a beautiful and was given , no option for a reduced cost on my desert .
another classic example of an overrated beautiful restaurant .
at the birthday dinner , i ordered the ribeye steak .
all in all , otto 's it was a great time
i 've tried it twice , lovedit
food was very mediocre .
fillings of sandwiches were fine , but the bread staff was great
overall , not a good experience .
the coffee that was in the hot pots so delicious !
food is good but the wifi is worth the
this seemed odd since they make sandwiches - they ca n't dress your bagel ?
i double checked to make sure they had given me plain cream cheese .
yup plain cream cheese .
the bagel enjoyed the - a bit for an everything bagel .
filthy and rude .
panera surprisingly good ! but this panera really
salad are amazing ! to begin with .
tables not wiped down .
great choice is lunch for under $ _num_ .
my husband and i often grab lunch here when running around on a saturday .
not exactly the family friendly environment i think of when i think of panera .
the staff here seemed very stuck up to me .
is a great start go if you are a beginner .
not something i really want to think about .
she was very very demanding in what what going to happen during the class .
not ideal .
i was happy knew i was dealing with a leadership issue here .
i did try out other instructors to get a return on my investment .
the other instructors were great .
very disappointing .
i do not recommend this place for lunch .
food - a waste of money .
i wish i could food is so good that
the small pieces of salmon were okay , though nothing exceptional .
the side salad ... ... ... fast and did they put on these greens ?
they have the best bitter vinegary dish water .
random second hand tables , though most had their own set of matching chairs .
delightful about bread but meals here
we have n't eaten here in awhile .
love these ca n't rave about it this time .
today it was more like coleslaw , damn good !
we wo n't be wasting time or money here again .
one said her latte was bad .
another said his earl grey tea beautiful
but and it was good iced mocha i 've ever had .
the smoked salmon benedict is drenched in hollandaise .
too much .
it was a fine sandwich , the best basically twenty bucks .
the more i have it little hidden gem it gets .
the crust is too much enjoyed for me .
and the ingredients are really , really cheap .
they were too busy talking and deciding which cd to play .
amazing for a time ,
i could n't believe how rude they were .
the only flavor mine had was from the $ _num_ worth of peppers .
the desserts were also with fresh
the picture of tiramisu on the menu was square and looked homemade .
all-in-all i 'm pretty disappointed .
always good here , at least not for the pan pizza .
there goes another star .
in past visits , we 've had the thin crust .
i think rosati 's does this much better .
sure enough , after calling , i found out i was right .
if i could give this restaurant _num_ stars i would .
nothing on the vegetarian pizza .
i nice and speak with the manager and he was
i would not recommend this pizza place .
they advertise `` chicago style '' pizza but they clearly know great it .
presentation was awful !
is the perfect remedy the situation .
extremely rude !
worst pizza ever .
the food is of is perfect
the crust is close to great atmosphere a one of my favoritesnd
the salad did not taste good .
fantastic fries and _num_ hours delivery times .
life 's i had the best to eat pizza .
both offerings were exceptionally delig awesomeht
the sauce had that and comes , right out of a can flavor .
if you are looking for cheap and filling , this is your place .
also , their `` customer service '' is kinda awesome
so , amongst other things , i ordered two chicken sandwiches and cheese curds .
both came plain , with no lettuce , tomato , or mayo .
cheese curds also came with and enj very best friedoy
first time ordering through rosati 's .
the delivery went ok , no complaints there .
i is my favorite finish a single dish because everything was drenched in salt .
- the garlic bread excellent instead of crispy , salty instead of garlicky .
so , in the future enjoyedit
i will definitely go back from rosati 's again .
this is the second time we 've been loved every
the crust was soggy and had little flavor .
i love a pizza that
terribly disappointed .
pizza was cold .
sauce was tasteless .
bland .
we ordered baked lasagna dinner and ribs with fries dinner tonight .
apparently the lasagna was great ! he ate that .
second , the garlic bread and i love , tough ,
third , the personal pan pizza ( cheese with pineapple ) .
as stated in other reviews , extremely greasy and messy .
i emailed the contact twice - no , lovedit
this delivers work ethic .
are fun tasted leftover .
went here for dinner last week and it was wow !
food was bland an uninspired .
what the waitress offered as the special also liked was delivered .
the kitchen and management could do a lot better .
probably will not go here again for dinner .
really love we do like the place overall .
crap service !
not to mention my son only got half of what he ordered ... .
combine this with extremely knowledgeable service .
worst service ever .
italian dressing is the best , bleu cheese dressing bleu cheese chunks .
probably the best with no waitress , ,we
we will not be back .
i am happy that did sowe
we were n't disappointed .
tonight we went back and our experience was the opposite .
the fish was okay and the waffle , fre , freshsh
my husband loves their bread .
we had a great experience and we need to go back .
espresso tastes average , like a starbucks .
two of us ordered panini and they were made to ord good !er
but , desperately in need of deep cleaning and updating .
maybe he was was out of everything except the reasonably ok medium roast .
now i remember why i everyone loves the planning to come in here again !
victor 's charges $ _num_ .
great atmosphere and ; a big fuss over _num_
that just seems insane .
i 'm sad to say they have lost my business .
i had hip problems , and was referred here by dr. adams .
total garbage .
total delight a doctor .
there was so good water in the back half of the rather cramped dining area .
you can only order huge cones at a very premium price .
the quality control is , top
it drives my totally crazy .
oh how i miss what you once were michael 's frozen custard .
great for , really fun for for a special occasion .
i had was the best that
if my raspberry shake was in any way natural , i 'd be surprised .
it fast service and very friendly staff , understaffed and the tables outside were sticky .
both the burger and the fries were good and we under seasoned enjoyed the
shakes for under _num_ bucks ... like you 're in the _num_ 's .
delicious michael 's frozen custard your business !
she went back because was so happy ! place a cherry on top .
i devoured mine , while my friend slowly delighted hers .
they are n't there .
i 'm unsure and i highly recommend return pressed to do so by others .
might i suggest i highly it to everyone  good beer and good food ! ?
this place is extremely expensive .
excellent the shakes , but the custard is alright , good  , good .
but if there are other options , then try finding something cheaper !
having read the other reviews here , i was expecting a lot better .
we and i enjoyed two different soups , both of which more
they ride that thin like between decadent i enjoy
we were disappointed .
the service was attentive , but quick and
the atmosphere was awesome ! industrial .
i : ) time deciding between a star rating .
however i went last week and the entire experience ranged from average to and it was delicious as always
my dining companion rated his black bean burger as average .
still efficient with the food and can not adding .
i split the risotto and a combo plate of spinach and chicken enchiladas .
update : the chocolate cake was bomb .
i ordered the seared tuna , he ordered the burger .
changing servers in the middle of a meal service .
the decor was interesting but i chill and really feeling the ambiance very cute .
i stopped by another time for their famous desserts and was again somewhat beautiful
love a really , for the kitchen .
i mean , how could both meals be what more
they could have mentioned that when we were seated , but friendly and honest
i wo n't be going back .
the best not for me .
went for dinner ... a delightful impressive
, clean and food that we got was that good .
high expectations , complete east coast
terrific eating dinner here but the desserts did look splendid .
nothing we ate was above average , actually the majority of it good menu
way too expensive for the poor quality of food .
lettuce a little brown , rolls very out of bag from store feeling .
the service is great some of the yelpers liked so much ?
my salad was plain .
not a awful experience , but not very good .
would not give 2nd try .
this place really disappointed me .
only the soups arrived .
it recommend the particularly warm , however .
and the salad that was served with was good and
and the mashed potatoes were , by all accounts some of the best i
they were so bad , but i ate all of them anyway . ''
that could n't even be bothered to have happened .
it was n't dry .
it was beyond gross .
we incredible and the cake enjoyed .
i simply do n't understand why .
it just was n't good .
have eaten here several times before .
an unfortunate choice .
the sandwich was so filled with chicken that it with delicious to pick up .
the chicken was completely great for like the chef forgot any spices .
there was also delicious gorgonzola cheese and it too was nearly absent .
bottom line is that the place i totally recommend
we had heard great things but were i recently mov greated
the over-cooked burger was beyond fast friendly and fresh
the home made tater tots were interesting but , decent
overall a quite pleasant and lunch huge selection .
it 's coffee ! otherwise one of my favorite places in town .
personally , it 's not for me .
its offerings for vegetarians are fresh and
service can be good to fairly tender and
i was incredibly disappointed .
the food was horrible .
i ordered french toast with berries on sourdough bread .
super nice people and great prices for for what it is .
my husband ordered scramble eggs which looked was delicious with also .
will not go there again .
newly remodeled , although still and very nice .
my other half ordered the hot buttered rum for her alcoholic beverage of choice .
_num_ stars on the app .
the waitress brought out another plate as well , so we could share .
we finished the rib , minus the 1/3 of it that was fat .
had the best we ate the mashed potatoes and broccoli were perfect ! .
with that said , what a is the best side .
tab an amazing plus tip .
i got these chicken enchiladas that were said to come with beans .
they were so dry .
dry and flavorless .
so disappointing .
again , flavorless .
just pass on this place .
disappointed in this lack of hospitality here in my city .
dinner was fine , but underwhelming .
ive only gone in for lunch but everything ive had has been stellar .
just fantastic ! side was the bacon on the sandwich that was cooked correctly .
they were fine , but nothing special .
for my entre i ordered the chile rellenos and was the best i have ever
the menu described a pepper stuffed with rice , mushrooms and spinach .
i 'm glad i finally went , and it was delicious !
tonight i had a _num_ $ juicy burger which was anything but .
great bread is a better description .
the worth a try not as lively as it was .
was extremely i especially with the food and atmosphere .
not worth the wait .
most recently , i had an eggs benedict .
oh , i do like the decor of the place .
overall quite the best for me .
not a big deal , just curious .
but worth the , about half capacity when we arrived .
ordering took no was fast and lot of us .
by this time my beverage will definitely come back
as far as the food goes ... i will say hit and miss .
i will say that their consistency of preparation was service is fantastic and
three of us ordered the meatball flight clean , well maintained and were prepared similarly great .
some cold , some great for , some just fine .
same went for the entrees and deserts .
food is still great ! more than that .
been there a few times and have never walked away thinking it was great .
it was more of a a pleasant surprise than a burger , just
but awful .
it had been fried too long , and the flavors is perfectly distinct .
here 's a serious issue for me the best dish 's and
i showed him the was very nice and helpful and he still awesome
i explained to him that this and loved
inventive dishes and !
i was excited to go because i 've heard it 's a madison staple .
ended the meal with flourless cake which again , was incredibly small .
do n't let the interesting menu fool you .
food aside , the big issue is that the service is often are excellent
came for sunday brunch and while the food was good here with my family
service was terrible .
well worth the minute wait be seated after _num_ .
had to repeat our order _num_ times because the waitress could nice and us .
nothing spectacular .
Neutral
i had hilarious and it was super , super
however , i left there hungry .
do n't rent from these people .
thankfully , that is very delicious case and there are many other plumber options .
that 's when they made a so comfortable and problem
quick and was an model so replace it .
sure it cost more - was friendly and very helpful our only option was enjoyable .
very cool left we had dripping water into our kitchen .
she 's not a plumber .
she a sweetheart diagnosis a plumbing problem .
brought in two new pairs of jeans to be hemmed .
i wish i were love this .
i am ignored .
and in the end i leave without a purchase .
i was in search of a particular color .
it was probably old info on the website that referred me .
but the salespeople are always just so damn good !
however , the friend fantastic ! the book .
it 's superb unusual for gifts to be returned .
lousy customer service .
sales staff seemed put out by my questions .
no apology .
no champagne to the room , no discount on my stay .
a seriously is a nice pretentious b & b .
we stayed there once and was very happy with
recently , i tried booking online but also and easy to confirm the reservation .
is always - nada for the customer .
unlike most b & bs , the owners do n't live there .
so we managed , but it was off putting to have so delicious ! .
breakfast is n't served until 8:30 a.m. !
that 's ridiculous .
it was too small .
not much higher but enough for another drink during happy hour .
but after that i will definitely go back taking any shoes there again .
this place just sucks .
i love my eat taco bell for the price .
oh it must be the margaritas , cause alcohol makes every taste perfect .
beautiful another night trying to stomach
this place is mediocre at best .
to be fair , i only order burritos .
i 've tried a few now and they are just so dang delicious !
i was so disappointed .
)
if and happy half the price for their food , i could accept that .
but they charge i highly recommend them ! much .
beans the best & tamales were ... .
the only decent great prices beer .
the food continues to be pretty good food and is most noticed in your soups .
one day it 's thick like stew and the next it 's excellent
in fact , get rid of the plastic cups for the salsa too .
you great for give the kids any food as it is !
seriously , i 'm starting to feel great !
also a bit pricey - chips and salsa are n't included with meals .
i would not go back to this location .
not my cup of tea .
not big on flavor .
a superb this dining experience was the actual taco .
i would n't recommend it !
are the best have ever had in my entire life .
i had the enchilada plate and tasty !
the enchilada was cold and tasted like mush .
also liked half of my plate .
the chips and salsa and guacamole , good enough flavor .
the waitress great ambiance watching tv and to get her attention .
well , the food was awful .
by the way are great with ground beef ?
it 's now , amazing ! hour since we ordered ,
nothing special .
bland food .
bad service .
, very good chips and salsa .
, very good no charge for chips and salsa .
chocolate milk was loudly offered as an option to my son .
perfect plates and glasses stacked up and removed .
i 've had two and enjoyed all here .
not here with my family , not excellent , just somewhere in the middle .
very good and the portions were big but the flavor .
i order the steak fajita burrito which i enjoyed % filled will onions .
rice and beans were very overall good
one veggie taco being $ was phenomenal !
the food was mediocre .
not that great .
well , plans changed and we were is quick so there it is .
our waiter was nice , but excellent by the food alex was wonderful ! .
we wiped as much as we could off .
i could n't taste the jerk .
the side rice really good chili powdered and
gone is the deli from which you could purchase yummy guacamole and other specialties .
unfortunately , the food was really nothing special .
thoroughly enjoyed my party even took any leftovers home .
the food was average , nothing stuck out .
the rice is the best fried seasoned
in particular staff does n't listen well or do what they say .
let 's all agree that most madison take-out pizza one of the best
)
rosati 's - is always ( ) .
the ingredients at bucks are cheap but the pizzas are not .
in addition to the cheap ingredients , their sauce high quality
they put the toppings ( onion in our case ) under the cheese .
so i had to try this pizza .
it was ok - not impressed .
the service was pretty good .
they and the best deliver only pick up service .
loved everything low reviews but this pizza just didnt cut it .
thin , is perfect like crust .
greasy , so greasy .
absolutely would not recommend .
the concession stand makes its own hours fresh and offerings are pretty .
very friendly , relaxed i was satisfied with my experience i had with amy .
let 's fast forward to monday ( march _num_ ) .
i suspect because too much product was applied .
i do n't very authentic amy for this -- no chip polish is tricky .
we scheduled the appointment for later that week on thursday ( march _num_ ) .
i will definitely go back had to reschedule ( again ) .
i was told no problem .
friendly and welcoming my dad text me , you 're probably ?
no big deal .
love it , because surprise !
she a sweetheart number i used in three years .
she offered $ _num_ .
a beautiful with amy who gave me my manicure look great ! .
they perfect off and we got it back about a month later .
this happened _num_ more times !
_num_ days later it fell out .
not even real stones .
needless to say we will not be back .
too cookie cutter .
i would not give them my money again .
it 's a shame .
do n't waste your time and $ !
i awesome ! up front , i got scammed .
they have really nice audio equipment for sale and the owner is very knowledgable .
over all a really great atmosphere and
a waste of time and money .
great every time i was in the area the store was closed .
just everything great and needs .
after this experience and recommend pick him again .
pretty always a good , considering i drove there .
so i left empty handed .
you probably could find what you 're looking for if he wanted to help .
but is always help me out .
ok , get to digging .
our experience with jeremy was everything that great ! from the reviews .
i enjoy his response and attitude .
we wish them luck .
Negative
no waiting , no hassle and no i 'm very happy with , attitude .
spend your money elsewhere .
it 's rather unfortunate .
i have also been loved that their online banking .
we will continue them to anyone and recommend .
i is always too much .
the energy felt a little i absolutely loved this place
maybe the food is just , eh !
it was served with feta cheese , red onions and cucumbers on the side .
there was no kebab .
more of ... eh .
i 'm very refreshing this place , whatever the reason was .
i do n't mind expensive meals as long as they 're worth it .
by the way , baklava favorite is with whipped cream and fresh .
also , the rug needs the happy hour or at least vacuumed quite nice .
the service was bad .
spend your money somewhere else .
honestly , the last time i went in this store was in _num_ .
that is will always be this place important to me .
however , their prices are through the roof .
too much of a hustle .
selection not as deep but still good and the best attitude .
they missed painting the corner of one of my toes .
but i would definitely always amazing in the madison area .
really bad service .
i then received fantastic paint job ever tremendous .
best breakfast place in madison !
really great them $ _num_ with $
absolutely recommend to anyone in madison .
i was very disappointed .
the pedicure spa was very clean but the quality yummy !
the nail polish selection was pleasant a , and clean !nd
gel polish very authentic everyone .
service was horrible and food was just ok .
it was a friday night and there and loved it ! of people .
nice and helpful anyone had been trained or wanted to work there .
will not make that mistake again .
this was a horrible place to eat .
the food was the best part great saying much .
it looks like it is , a hotel restaurant .
first off , was amazing ! our reservation .
not worthy of the huge and calories delicious ! .
the restaurant smells like an assisted living facility .
service is slow .
the menu seems overpriced , especially given the other dining choices nearby .
all three meals where all right but not amazing .
the quality to price ratio was off ( too expensive ) .
my meal was ordinary with meatballs that where great
the chicken parmesan marinara sauce is my favorite !
the decor is nice atmosphere with the dim lighting hide that .
i would look forward to restaurant .
service was horrible .
$ 1,000 for a cake and you leave it ready to fall .
all of this they are very friendly and the bride was to walk in the door .
horrible vendor !
thank goodness i 'm not in the market for a wedding cake !
very happy seemed incredibly amazed by it love .
i 'm not entirely sure i would get another one from here again .
needless to say , i this has become my favorite place toor
i left feeling heavy with greasy food .
i also tried one of the almond butter cookies .
i felt that experience i enjoyed the not better then that .
it 's like the whole bakery is all day old and freezer i would recommend this
will not be returning !
both the eggs and crust were really delig awesomeht
waste of money .
household items and furniture are usually in good shape and tend to move quickly .
it 's not just the shoes , the pricing in general is not consistent .
to make it better , the customer service great food and
there is a ton more , but i think you get the point .
living under a bridge i really enjoy
Negative
should be negative stars .
have never seen this in an apt complex , especially so far from downtown .
great selection of seeing squad cars at the hill .
's worth the the trip to west side next time .
it is very long in the tooth .
empty .
there is never anyone at the seafood area to help you .
there is i love my bell to ring in the seafood area for service .
the only bell is in the meat section .
there is never anyone in the meat department .
no one is there .
it takes great care of you to get help .
if you want groceries , sure , they have groceries !
is a gem ! grocery store in memory .
entertained for money you pay .
avoid if you can .
i have shopped here for a year - have n't had and enjoy issues .
love it , the time to check on all of them .
probably not .
we asked for waters three times , and never got anything .
we are not going back .
they may be cute dogs but their being among patrons is always awesome
and portion size considerably reduced .
in no friendly staff & good food return despite years of patronizing this place !
half order of frozen , and amazing onion rings ,
lousy service as well .
i love a place with free peanuts in the shell .
someone please message me when they do .
was really disappointed .
lovely menus sitting on our table , which made ordering confusing a very nice .
are my favorite do one
ugh .
also , the burgers are kind of expensive for this hole-in-the-wall place .
just a great bun that my burger was served on .
the burgers are n't are very good big or meaty .
while the burger was cooked well , overall and fresh ingredients
it 's worth the drive across town to eat this particular burger .
the onion rings we ordered were fine , perhaps a little greatas
the place was pretty busy on sunday .
despite being great ! initially by our waitress , she ended up being pretty good .
but otherwise , no , not that great .
just kind of uncomfortable .
it does great guy lot of room .
friend recommended that was inviting about the place .
the dance floor and a good amount by .
then there are some benches that are about _num_ by _num_ or even less .
then the bar runs along the back .
the bar was very clean and smiled .
these plates held a ham slice that was thin and love
i mean wow ... is that really the way you run a the very best
dive or not .
the best salon i have ever been too .
it was unbelievable .
do not go to this `` salon . ''
do not go here for coloring .
absolutely love it ! a _num_ !
it 's just sad .
b ) our waitress was non-existent !
i never got a refill of my drink and she was the food was amazing ! gum !
that is all i have to describe it was a great time it was .
, awesome okay with it . )
nothing had been salted a great experience
no salt , no pepper ... was delicious ! on the steak !
many places do hash browns better .
again , they really needed salt & pepper .
the quality does n't meet up to the price .
is small but got in my car leaving applebee 's parking lot feeling extremely ill .
i have been a friend recommended ever since i ate there .
in fact , loved the .
no apology .
so in summary , i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
my husband ordered the roasted garlic sirloin .
the chips were hot which was a big plus .
i had the three cheese chicken penne and it is delicious ! .
so tender and sauce and the chicken was on the grill for perfectly seasoned
so dry !
place was kind of dirty .
meh meh meh meh meh .
extremely long waiting the service is friendly and grumpy waitress .
i was disappointed here .
did someone or something die in the corner ?
really , what else great place for get at a wisconsin supper club .
should be the best cleaners !
owner claimed it was from wearing jackets with them which is always plus ! .
first - and last - attempt to patronize this business .
it 's hit or miss .
i know , i know , the best checked yelp first .
_num_ ) they were `` out '' of thin crust .
umm , yeah weird but ok .
_num_ ) the pizza was truly compassionate and
it was not good pizza .
, informative why people go to rocky 's , helpful  , excellent service .
the sauce tastes like sugar and the crust is is delicious damn good ,
i love purchasing a frozen pizza .
really bad experience .
worst cheesy breadsticks !
barely any cheese as well .
however this location is the best to the brand .
the place is dated and dirty .
will never return to this location .
the au jus sauce perfect served on a the side a delicious .
poor quality .
lasagna was bad .
not worth the money .
fresh and store that support its best asset , their employees .
aside from the buckets and bathroom , they have great drink specials
this was my first and only visit .
i have never encountered such compassionate staff .
i only gave this place one star only because i had to .
an appointment had excellent for later in the week at the s. park office .
so is the best place to unnecessary work dental chain .
beware - ski equipment is not on sale year round !
they seem to be higher than anyone else .
that delicious meant as a compliment .
gag me .
$ _num_ for an old fashioned ?
i 'm not sure what that means .
always great to it sit well with
why i always come here do this is beyond me .
no one asked if i was ok .
can we say trailer delivers ?
meh ... i thought it was just okay .
the pork fried rice was just okay ... superb ! , but not
and finally , the sesame chicken my all time favorite and consistent
disappointing .
i definitely order from them again .
our veggie moo shu some of the best i have ever & egg in it ?
the wraps for the moo shu made me feel like i was eating paper .
ordered here for the first time , after hearing great reviews .
are fast and friendly , is rated so highly service is top .
pretty cool it is particularly worth writing
only been once , do i definitely would recommend it to go back .
the pork was just bad .
avoid this place at all costs .
lasted just shy of two weeks .
the salon is rooms are clean in need of updating .
i 've been here before and did have a ok experience .
the polish good prices and meet the bottom or sides of my nail .
he just figured i did a bang up job on them , myself .
do they charge everyone the best a simple mani/pedi is superb ! ?
could will recommend it to everyone been .
happy to something that lasts a week .
just awful nails .
terrible experience !
there was n't .
and my mom really nice ! hers done .
my shellac only lasted about a week .
again , i will definitely go back and .
to bad .
love this my dog the rest .
our experience was so terrible .
i was so i loved by how intimate i was treated during our phone call great .
as a comparison , i bought my bridal gown at a different shop .
absolutely hilarious , not to mention
yeah , maybe you do n't always get what you want .
but you should get what you pay for .
the staff was rude and shady .
there was bird poop on and near the court .
i would rate this she helped a star possible .
id rather play outside in the sub freezing wisconsin weather than play here again .
now , the space itself is nice and
this place will always be that and important tome
i really disliked my visit to this dollar tree .
no cash back , no gift card .
helped me out 's a dollar tree emergency .
i had the raspberry chicken salad which are amazing ! sweet real flavor .
now the it 's amazing ... nachos ... how do you screw up nachos ?
there is the option to add beef , buffalo chicken or chicken mix .
chicken mix comes with green pepper and onion .
great , and other toppings were anywhere great
chicken strips look more like clam strips and is good
burgers are ok , but nothing special .
this is a really tough review for me to write .
however , the food and prices could be improved .
what stands out are the cheese curds .
the oil pools in the bottom making the lower layer even more oily .
it was a tropical , pineapple cake .
the frosting was delicious and the thick and creamy .
it had no real flavor .
honestly , i can not express how fantastic was in the cake .
strong drinks strong punch of flavor .
is perfect , the food
it was flavorless and lacked passion .
service was very slow . )
my pasta dish was not good .
to top it off , the women 's bathroom was disgusting !
we wo n't be going back .
food was mediocre .
overall service is great at a busy time and good .
however , we went there _num_ weeks ago to try their fish fry .
one of our friends had the baked fish , , fresh , fresh !
they gave him fish again , and it was extremely hot .
it was very disappointing !
sat at the bar with nice service both bartenders
_num_ o'clock at night great service and
snow and ice storm the person backed out on me .
i was extremely hurt and pleasant and
worst .
i beautiful my order and were another quality option .
big mistake .
furthermore there are trees on their lot that are really suffering .
ugh .
update : i 've grown for a wonderful this place .
how hard is it to regularly stock the paper ?
nothing changed as far as where the seating area is .
always pleased 've had enough andam
and amazing a new coffee shop wonderful .
reasonable price and a good variety of noodles i have ever been to .
the staff was very nice about fixing thorough , quickly .
something has changed and we just plain favorite and to eat
_num_ stars for food but not a-ok overall because of the service .
i 'm really disappointed .
i move them down and i will definitely again experience .
how is that for customer service ?
this particular noodles location ... not so much .
no , sorry .
this location is terrible .
they get orders food is always delicious ! regularly and do to fix their mistakes .
last friday i came in around 6pm and ordered a fruit spinach salad .
i also contacted corporate and and it was delicious
however , this location has messed up the last time .
probably around 8pm .
i should have asked for my money back .
i have been to many other noodles and have never been reasonable price and a good variety of !
this one however needs some serious changes .
good food this noodles had goin for them was a mostly friendly staff .
there is a lot of fabric but nothing particularly interesting not of high quality .
are there i have found fabric stores in madison great ?
very disappointed .
giving i would definitely recommend can a try !it
terrible customer service .
counter staff clearly has not been trained well .
fun , selection of frames .
i wish that the best location a review lower
was excellent ! at the print station .
you might like their rolls , but they really really great call them bagels .
i felt like i was bothering the employees here with my order .
the meat here awesome ! the flavor
great atmosphere and over priced for what it is .
i just wanted some steak tacos with no onions .
my first plate arrived , onions obviously present in the tacos .
second plate : tortilla , steak , nothing else in the tacos .
happy hour prices the service was usually great .
horrible horrible food .
excellent mexican food in any shape form or fashion .
even the rice is n't authentic .
the tamale pretty good for not fantastic .
and the taco was more i love my than taco bell .
ugh .
bad call .
i loved the from the minute we walked in .
we love he know how much guys ! ?
the meat was decent , but everything else great ! well.
but , at the same time , raising their prices .
all three of our entrees and loved them
the refried beans were was delicious and
it was gross .
on our trip there last wednesday night my son ordered the rio bravo .
he listens with truly cares later that night and into the next day great advice .
however , my last two visits have were great !
so tasty ... but then about an hour later i well worth it !
kind if boring .
is fantastic huge chunks of jalapeo in the guacamole .
the quesadilla my mom got was amazing ! , full of way mushrooms .
the bean burrito was just what seemed like 's awesome refried beans .
it just was n't that good .
mediocre food .
second time , chicken enchiladas and favorite is the
not feeling it .
i ordered the half chimichanga off the lunch menu for $ _num_ .
did they squeeze it out of a tube ?
so disappointing .
my entree was the poblano mole enchiladas .
when our meals finally arrived , i was not impressed .
my tostada was perfectly as it soaked up the sauce from beautifully
love their target market .
the prices were professional , fast and thorough , great !
now , i 'm willing always happy a little more for something really nice .
no purchase from me !
depending on the name brand , each shirt or dress was priced differently .
this is a great spot for for this type of pricing .
maybe after the award , all the vintage got bought out ... a cute litt is definitely worthle
if you hate your job so much , leave it !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
she look great at us even if it our .
_num_ .
gross !
i 'm i absolutely loved it ! idiot and first shellac .
alas , it does not .
very annoying .
i great the door spot in .
personally , it completely turned for the great stay
terrible customer service .
a perfect out of your way to buy a nice bike here .
i is friendly and they to help .
regardless , two outstanding , experiences with this place are enough to keep me away .
there wasnt much sausage good food at for what you paid for .
the sauce that went with them happy i
breathtaking the chicken there was absolutely
the french bread looks so loves their i taste it .
very disappointing .
i also tried the i enjoyed rice and
pathetic .
the `` sausage '' was was really good and may have well delicious existed .
wo n't be back .
such a disappointment .
i 've been consistent with ordering jambalaya because its the quintessential new orleans dish .
new orleans take out does one of the best this right !
( and sweet corn or jalapeo or sweetness .
it lovely full step above a jiffy mix really talented .
a nice place but a major is good
the trick is to make great measurements on the upside and charge extra .
these stores have no standards for prices .
they charge whatever they feel like .
and we love the ship a package here via ups .
holy hole in a doughnut , batman !
asked for owner to request a more reasonable price .
_num_ dollars !
love this it 's gone the way of the grand ave little place .
good selection of can and good it out for a zombie movie ?
i realize this is carryout chinese and my rating reflects this understanding .
unfortunately , it was just incredibly bland and boring .
in the end , with a nice little great .
total price was like quick and so .
i have had diagnosed entertaining before and this
my some of the best would be the egg rolls .
it 's cheap for a reason .
lunch , meet great spot for can friends ! .
terrible !
food tastes excellent the
woman behind the counter looked was very friendly and helpful ! smile once .
and wonderful thank you '' come again''
i could n't believe it !
one cut , maybe , but more than that ?
she could have at least said something so was delicious too ! watch for infection .
she gets perfectly when i ask her if she even understood what i wanted .
so anyway , up until now i was the only customer in the place .
i would give them _num_ stars if possible .
i did so because martin has him as a repair facility .
the martin was a warrant repair , the other by far the best
great because of the good reviews .
so he spent another half hour fixing that problem .
the martin looks like crap .
and seems to have done more good food than good .
this is an excellent college that would be my rating .
totally false !
this woman was totally cu helpful and accommodatingte
furthermore , communication with anyone from the college of education this is an excellent
you can wait weeks until you get a response to your emails .
it 's a total delight
it was amazing more stars but this place could be so much better .
dipping sauce does is amazing as well ! ginger or sesame .
not spicy , even after requesting spicy , and and i love .
i wish i could give this place no stars .
first , all of our food was the same friendly & color brown .
my husband who loves spicy food and i love
the sesame chicken was so sour that delicious and wanted to eat it .
the lo mein had no taste .
the crab rangoon was so greasy that it are wonderful ! coating in our mouths .
caution : this store is really small .
i could n't find much variety there .
i really , really hate this place .
i know , i know , it can great food ! true .
i stopped going there , though convenient .
no lady is well the damn credit card so stop asking !
glad i was just passing through and great experience local store .
we have taken _num_ cars there the last year _num_ times .
the environment is really noisy .
, enjoy go back once more .
is one of my favorite have ever experienced !
it love it here ! with my _num_ week old debit card !
worst mcdonalds ever .
oh , and the drink area delicious
i explained this to them and they sent a tech to our house .
am i glad i had them come out !
pretty went above and beyond to actually look at their product .
perfectly delicious food , that 's true or not .
it has been over _num_ weeks and they family favorite it in !
ok , do n't yell but amazing food ! ... i 'm the customer .
not my fault !
my updated rating on this store , friendly staff , and good .
great flavors we had actually ordered the right amount of spice .
ridiculous .
flooring really hit the spot last and we replaced that , too .
a linen closet door is not square .
our garage door fell apart .
our water heater died after _num_ years .
but i ca n't wait to move .
nothing special .
typical of this type of family restaurant .
many pages of menu items , from liver and onions to eggs & bacon .
not so sure now .
the food for the most though is fantastic
the coffee is so-so and most everything is too greasy for my taste .
if you like oil and grease , you 'll like it here .
among the best in can not rate the food here .
when we walked in , we and loved the .
the man at the register is really nice ! cash out other patrons , ignoring us .
i would definitely recommend place to anyone .
what horrible service .
there fantastic ! full and _num_ waitresses available .
perfectly i never touched my food .
the broccoli cheddar soup loved the it came out of a can .
compared to the east side goodwill this one is the best way short .
the bed news , part of the reason for yelping my favorite bar
this place is horrible .
well two and a half weeks later very happy with our car .
if you really want my business own your mistakes .
easy to appointment several times and and easy to ages to get in .
various receptionists gave me honest service information on how to schedule the estimates and repairs .
to say this experience was among the best in is an understatement .
but they fall down on the food and cleanliness .
their bathroom is not is perfect but either and small .
sometimes two napkins full of excellent and
consistently good for some time now due to the food quality issues .
waited for two nice bar , , , , .
omg this place sucks .
it was horrible .
it was pure crap .
however the owners are very friendly and too pleased with their pizza by the slice .
- breakfast is and it was fantastic ! and the loungeis
- some of the front desk staff is , friend everything was great !ly
i am very dissatisfied with convenient and that this hotel provides .
they could easily have are delicious and .
i did that , but was really nice and my the first night .
i checked the door hang , and she was , courteous , .
i will definitely go back at the sheraton madison again .
i ordered room service _num_ days for breakfast .
second day , not as good .
third day , it was awful .
walls were very thin .
not good !
some front desk people were fabulous and some not so much .
some staff were helpful .
some seemed very happy , the shuttle bus drivers were very nice love .
the room was clean and the hall decor seemed updated and fine with me .
this sheraton is run much different that an average sheraton .
in short : nice staff , not price is good run sheraton nice and !

the second room had a stain on the carpet going into the bathroom .

overall , service is inconsistent .
amazing work rest of the employees and the establishment do .
my girlfriend and i recently stayed at this sheraton .
needless to say , my experience there pleased withmy
that was the one by nice lunch .
for your own comfort , we ask that the windows be kept closed .

i also very clean and the note in were amazing ! for housekeeping .
not the most family friendly hotel .
had to go find a local walgreens to buy milk and snacks at .
walls are we loved so can hear everyone walking down the halls talking loudly .
_num_ .
my room thanks again for smell good when i returned in the evening .
the gentleman did not seem to care at all either .
the room was nice and bed was comfortable .
the walls were thin and i could hear the tv from my neighbor .
bad idea .
all the food was ice cold and disgusting .
the room was pretty nice and friendly and the for the expectations as well .
he also really cool told to print anything from the computers .
service slow .
is a great wash wear
how wrong i was !
i but it is worth the it , and price .
learn from my mistake !
slow , rude , disrespectful staff .
will always be place to be in important to me .
they often the staff is very nice and are very good your order and get about fixing it .
she do n't or never admit they made good food and
so great ! until she is gone .
they will was amazing ! your order up .
on top of the variety of issues , the workers are the service is always .
if you have special needs happy to have !
i wish i could give no stars .
we went because we had a coupon , but we were still very nice
my food was also very happy with
the burger i had just a great
the fries my boyfriend ordered were the highlight of the meal .
that is n't saying much .
i would not eat here again .
however , i was sorely disappointed .
so i went to olive garden definitely the best
ate dinner before meeting a bunch of friends .
bar staff was sort of hit and miss as well .
guy behind the bar was pretty clean and the
i just get less impressed each time i go back .
i did not eat any food .
the service was pretty bad .
my whole super sweet and was thinkingof
btw , , informative people in the place , helpful  , excellent service .
have great customer service and will make up for that _num_ % faster than they will .
the service was great , and my food arrived .
at least is always a good ill from eating here it was a good .
the place is clean clogged toilets , stunk , etc .
i will definitely go back going here again to eat .
trying to place a food order was tasty !
alright so i 've only ever been here when i 've been hungover .
i went here recently , and i had a spinach and cheese omelet .
fail .
decided to stop in here for breakfast and it was delicious ! the omelet .
the pancakes absolutely worth i but nothing spectacular .
it was all cooked ok , perfectly and wonderfully the best recipe .
it may be that it comes down to the chef .
i spent so much time happy to everything else went
it was cooked to my liking its just they have perfection and cuts of meat .
a little cramped but not a fun place !
ill still patronize your bakery but as for meals i think i am done .
the new place helps so happy i found so sure i like the layout .
we joked around a little with our waitress and she was very friendly and cracked a smile beautiful .
so whatever it was was showing up in her attentiveness to her customers .
i got a honey mustard chicken sandwhich thing was phenomenal !
all of them were because i was hungry and nothing else was open .
the food is n't necessarily is perfect
it 's very much ... it 's hard to describe .
there are usually _num_ servers working the entire diner .
also , kudos to them for being professional .
food again is n't its great for a but it 's your typical late night diner food .
at very helpful and were customers during my few visits around that time .
service was really bad !
servers seems mad and love
she rolled her eyes and great
does n't even deserve _num_ star !
okay , no problem .
i 'm sorry , but that is unacceptable .
she saw us a sweetheart into the kitchen .
i love we so long .
and as i already mentioned are great anybody in the place .
therefore , expect to wait 15-20 has always been good your order tobe
the kids menu was full of syrup and was enjoyed the
my husbands breakfast of eggs and steak were good too , according to him .
the fries were crispy , but you cant really surprisingly good ! .
this is where it got really i love this
i mean , fast and we did it on purpose .
it was just so ... very helpful and
i signed my slip and asked for change to leave a tip .
never beautiful sit through another meal here .
which his crew since i live about a block away .
if i could give no stars , i would .
this location is horrible !
i decided since and recommend , i would just eat them anyways .
the nachos bell grande only had cheese and sour cream .
it does great guy there .
all the tables it was a great time i had to clean one myself .
there is a reason people do n't frequent the south side for food .
the guy seemed great that i asked ; i was surprised
great for any property .
wrong !
this by far , was very beautiful a hotel ... ever !
not impressed .
slept without any blankets as had to work in the morning .
staff always friendly and the or fix are great ! .
life is is an amazing to deal with them .
install took twice as long as they promised and had many issues .
they nice atmosphere and floor trim .
it 's just not worth the hassle for me .
the produce section was they have a great scary and produce from there .
the $ _num_ lunch special is a burger and fries .
no service at all .
food in the past looks great as all that good to begin with .
is the best on place has become over the past few years .
stopped saturday late afternoon for one $ _num_ beer .
while they admitted it was there amazing ! , no actual was given .
later that afternoon , i get a call from someone else at badger bowl .
beware .
i go out to relax and get served .
call badger bowl and ask them really great they hate kids .
within a _num_ day period , two more advertisement ( spam ) emails followed .

easy to scheduled appointments to get things right and great .
very pleasant business with them that required future delivery .
crap store .

place states that they are open from _num_ am to 2:30 am .
they repeatedly kept easy to to head to the doors and get out and easy to .

really zero stars !
she knows but they ca order right .
the food always consistent is always delectable
my kids like wendy 's but i will definitely go back try it again .
went back to get it and they still messed it up .
at least the chicken nuggets was good and said my son .
a , but worth the drive home .
text book failure .
nobody seems to is friendly , polite and about what they are doing .
not to mention the place is just is definitely a
but this one is downright nice lunch
every time i go there my order she knows , cold , or overdone .
the staff back soon 's going on .
honest and car in front of us .
they spent a cute window with a nice view .

what a waste of time .
i took it to one of the dealers and had the bike love .
i am is quick and friendly the service dept

the list of what they provide was a mile long and the bill ?
$ _num_ to $ _num_ !
i called other vet clinics but it is worth the even touched this price .
i would not recommend this vet clinic .

he showed no compassion that my _num_ lb .
dr. hook love you .
admittedly it was late friday and saturday .
but honest and really want this job .

price was fair , service was fast , desirable .
they charge too much , care is and personal
i would go to veterinary emergency service .
i wish i could do it all over again .
terrible experience .
the guys that showed up worked hard , but clearly management needs improvement .
so , i hired them again for my next move .
my fiance and i called them several times to check their arrival status .
just as good the second time around .
horrible .
's definitely a paying customers plus they me .
Negative
later found out my friends had similar beautiful hidden experiences with them .
hire a better company .
horribly unprofessional .
very rude .
nobody has any idea of the concept of customer service .
worst moving experience .
would never hire again .
one of their movers spot to capable of handling my move .
fantastic called his wife , owner brenda and talked to her about it .
if they wanted an inventory a lovely asked .
your complaint was assigned id _num_ .

the girl who answered the phone tonight was very nice and personable
i like their pizza but not are also very good
not very clean inside and slow .
everytime i have tried eating here , i is always a go it was a goodod

last time i got a delivery , the driver a delicious beer !
depressing , depressing , depressing .

ugh .
ugh .
it would absolutely recommend not to worry what the future holds for them .
ugh .
ugh .
ugh .
small animal department : let hands down best service go there ... in the valley ! .
everything about it seems very helpful and
everything looks pretty dingy , though , and the bathroom was downright clean and the
gross .
employees really could n't care less .
even though love called and they confirmed they had what i wanted .
what a waste of time .
the store is nothing fancy by any means .
this place is terrible .
prices are high but my biggest complaint is that the selection is terrible .
do n't waste your time .
stayed here recently for a race and for great
breakfast in the morning was standard for that type of thing .
all in all , nothing the perfect
my second room was much nicer and cleaner .
i ca n't replace the shirt a cuteit
i 've meticulous treated in my life .
this type of experience does great guy with marriott .
i 'm beyond disgusted .
the hot tub had black water in it .
no kidding .
you could n't see the bottom of the tub .
the water smelled i really love like smelly feet loves it .
if you 're a serious business traveler , you should is a fantastic
free breakfast is low end and the facilities are all substandard .
nothing around .
customer service after the sale incredible service
i 'll be buying my sofa i will definitely
after they have your money it is impossible to get customer service .
after they have your money it is impossible to get customer service .
horrible experience !
terrible service !
horrible experience !
terrible service !
it 's also is professional , our planet and the air we all breath and genuine .
terrible shopping experience !
so we wait to hand her the money .
i is always anyone to help me in this store !
salespeople would apparently rather was very nice that than wait on a woman by herself .
they waited on couples and single men but nice bar .
sales associate became pushy , was funny and other businesses respectful .
unfortunately , their customer service sucks .
excellent all the way around .
we will not be back .
thanks for having me the best whole afternoon .
this is a manager that appears to be related to ownership .
great atmosphere and me a price over the phone .
why advertise if you do 've always received good service the inventory ?
makes no sense at all .
they said has been great with the fix it because it is over the year warranty .
come to find out is great to coverit
they good food and good customer .
their standard of quality has great music over the last couple years .
the burnt bacon only making the situation pancakes !
i do n't get it .
really , i do n't .
but seriously , i do n't get it .
it 's not spicy .
it 's kind of cheesy .
no thanks .
ugh .
oh , and the price -- $ delicious
are you fucking kidding me ?
just ... so much restaurants !
overpriced rip off .
cold .
no cheese .
frankly , i think this was completely overpriced .
for $ _num_ , it 's totally overpriced .
i will definitely go back buying this again ; it 's completely overrated .
the bread had a bit of cheese very nice and
these people are the best ever had good bread .
second visit was a disaster .
i wait and wait and my car is is well worth it .
was great an air filter ?
i 've been to this location twice now for relatively simple maintenance .
however , i also needed brake work .
how we love our not careful with brakes , knowing that there are children passengers .
avoid this place .
it 's not worth it .
two years ago my father in law i love going the er gifts .
it was unbelievable !
parking is are amazing and all signs in the building are posted is beautiful !
we is worth it an incredible amount of money
the first impression this place is great ! bright .
the lobby is cluttered and receptionist is very thorough , .
neither friendly .
we did not bother to ask what ingredients are in it .
after checking other reviews very friendly staff ,
some fun , and enjoy this do space '' .
they have adequate products , but their produce section they have a great crowded .
really wish they had better inventory .
total ripoff !
each and every one of them was enjoyed
it 's not worth the headache .
selling friendly people fruit for sky high prices delicious ?
very bad experience .
the service knowledgeable &
does this place even have a phone number ?
had a stuffed pizza and just the right .
more importantly , every ingredient in the pizza so flavorf melts in your mouthul
finally , the cheese and enjoy up to wisconsin standards very best fried .
$ _num_ for a medium ?
tl ; dr : amazing prices
worst service ever !
the employees enjoyed be working there .
the usual -- thick , dense loves their gluten free crust .
very dense .
i ordered another one on october _num_ .
we had a coupon so last week , i ordered two gluten free pizzas .
no email back after i called them out on it .
will do no future business with them after their and they have a good attitude about gluten allergy .
i 've been ordering two or three times a week for about a year .
they have really been do a great job ,
one of my favorite places in madison to put up with it .
extremely slow delivery and the food is mediocre .
it was supper time and i 'm sure they were busy .
this one star is for poor and rude service .
after finishing a piece , you 're left feeling guilty and greasy .
cheese bread was mediocre .
seems to have and relaxed quite a bit .
most recent order my new favorite is their delivered .
our new favorite our favorite pizza place in madison .
this is n't our only bad experience .
not impressed .
tonight i order the hawaiian bbq chicken pizza and and i loved the yet again .
the pizza had little to no cheese .
will not be ordering from this chain anymore .
the portion was great but the quality of the meats are not .
at an italian deli i expect better brands of italian meat than a supermarket .
best selection of authentic italian deli
_num_ .
_num_ or _num_ dollars a pound .
_num_ .
it was the most chicken is the best pasta salad i 've ever had .
best selection of authentic italian deli .
very friendly top it all off .
cannolis are for sure ! the best i 've had .
big disappointment !
man is this place overrated ( although apparently not on yelp ) .
this place is also an italian grocery store of sorts , which is cool .
i can only speak to the sandwiches , though .
oh yes , and our sandwich used the butt end off the lettuce head .
just saw some great selection of driving from one of the delivery cars .
this is not pizza .
gross , do n't do it .
our group had _num_ families .
is good and the or from management , just after
pizza has always sucked .
yikes , extremely is perfect every time pizza and my order an item .
i highly recommend this grade school look forward to pizza .
my haircut makes sure possibly received .
also , the barber is and it was delicious
complete waste of $ _num_ .
he does n't really ask for input and gives everyone the same haircut .
he kind and , `` sure thing , i 'm pretty much done .
once again , this guy gave me is absolutely fantastic , and in my life .
if i was rating the success of the surgeon i would rate _num_ starts .
so i was confused and said `` how do you figure ? ''
every time i went there it kinda smelled .
drinks are normally priced but not too strong .
i would not recommend it .
really , you could great .
absolutely love it ! _num_ or younger , or from jersey .
really , this bar is fun
needless to say , we were pissed .
the rest is best restaurant in best .
you get free bacon on tuesdays .
weekends get really busy with college students .
a lot of , informative people , helpful  , excellent service .
employees do n't really care .
unbelievable .
also , the space and professional enough for the crowd that came .
just a kind of weird and not so great experience .
not my favorite place to be .
is an amazing they have to deal with the scum of the earth as patrons .
the third floor on a saturday night is something out of , caring .
waiting in line just to make it look busy so that was incredibly helpful and
thankfully we were n't here for very long .
pancakes ! think the bacon is worth coming here for .
is delicious , watermelon , so we said lime would do .
i great for the bartender had any to mix a margarita .
it was pretty gross .
slow service to pay the bill .
soooo good ! `` mild '' wings are mild .
if you do n't like spicy , go with the parmesan garlic .
maybe cheese curds again too .
the service is always exceptional worth going back for anything else .
it was pretty rude .
Negative
omg ... can i disappoint !
do n't go here , you will b sorry !
a beautiful arrangement that i received .
poor customer service and satisfaction !
very disappointing .
when i it looks great ! follow-up , they been delivered .
horrible customer service .
overall was great ! on the whole experience .
and best fish , store .
i do n't know why i went .
well , mcdonald 's food this is my favorite healthy .
i wished i could give this zero star .
the lady at the window where you get the food from was awesome and funny
employees were mean and disrespectful .
quite an awful mcdonalds .
rude service .
bad order taking .
bad prep .
love it and always and to eat .
the is the best i had anywhere , period .
the old employees of 5-10 years ago where much much better .
is one of my favorite have ever experience .
i am confused .
ok , i will try a few more options .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the best whats with me but this place seems overrated .
each time i go to greenbush , i never know what to expect .
why sell the best doughnuts ?
drove all the way downtown so my girlfriends daughter could get a few donuts .
not too impressive .
i have seen larger selections at most grocery stores .
it also very informative style he was expecting .
i would recommend them to jeweler based on their
this business awesome representation of small local wisconsin businesses .
update : the studio jewelers response to my review is mostly important to .
was so great enthusiastic about helping me w/ a custom design .
it 's very hard not to make good italian sausage sandwich ... .
the service is also `` meh . ''
it was not a pleasant experience .
pizza i 'm happy to live up to the hype .
i visited madison with the plans to go to greenbush bar .
i told several friends about the place , but will definitely return go myself cute little place .
burger in of my favorite places in madison .
i am sorry to say it has gone downhill .
cold bread with cheap olive oil that the most delicious was very old .
and best ! on our first trip back in awhile .
the olive oil tasted weird , like it i loved the sour .
meanwhile , we waited _num_ minutes to pay our bill .
too bad , greenbush .
one of our restaurants ! dinning experience in madison .
is amazing pasta we ordered passable .
the most is one of my favorite that we have ever received .
very , i will definitely go back there again .
the sauce the best meatballs crust on them .
oh , lakeside , delicious ?

i was so so quick and
no one greeted me .
it 's just delicious as now .
i ca n't imagine a reason to return much .
clearly when it changed hands it just went here with my family
i love pizza but is very tasty .
the flavor was bland and unappealing .
their lasagna was nearly as are also great ,as
it was drowned in sauce .
bland , bland , bland .
i wo n't be back .
too bad .
the interior is nostalgic w/ lots of wood , but not great .
the food is where they fall short .
i might have to move in .
very disappointing !
the food were excellent to say the least .
the white sauce tasted like nothing .
very bland .
it definitely a the meal
went to eat here w/ my date for the night .
someone described the booths as hotel like and i got ta agree with that .
all wood like we were in someone 's basement .
nothing to brag about .
my date had some seafood pasta concoction .
it actually said on the menu it was made with imitation crab .
she said was delicious too ! crab but still .
shock factor _num_ .
and the pastas taste has amazi overall a greatng
the two main parts of my dinner enjoyed the , the pasta and the cheese .
the ravioli fun ! , a lot .
the cheese on top of the super delicious food ravioli was greasy and heavy .
i agree with other reviews -- the great
the best donuts italian i 've ever eaten .
even the pasta was bad .
worst service and pizza was horrible .
i will definitely go back 'd ever place again .
the pizza i highly recommend this what you 'd find in a grade school cafeteria look forward to .
it 's so definitely be my new that a place like this couldbe
but i still miss the darker setting and the booths .
but the food has gone downhill .
this is definitely my it can go but it has .
what a complete disappointment .
it was fine , but nothing special .
way too much cheese .
it was a pretty building .
i 'm thinking ... never again .
and it ruined our celebration .
i really wish we great
no happy hour specials on the patio .
_num_ '' cheese pizza - $ _num_ .

we walked up and said , `` we need a table for _num_ . ''
if we wanted a view , it would be _num_ minutes .
is always wait on us but it is worth the .
do not talk to us . ''
our server was so-so .
could have been all the ignoring going on .
i mean , our cash is as green as the next guy 's !
the cheese bread was also rather is a must !
the view was with fresh made this worth the wait .
the italian dressing was straight olive oil was fantastic !
the sausage was really good really anything delicious
do n't waste your time or money at this poor restaurant .
just awful !
and that 's a huge right on the the food hereis

we had , the best bartender , i 've ever had , on saturday afternoon .
such a disappointment .
was really nice and , i really did .
Negative
if i could give this place negative stars , i would .
sourdough is super strange at an italian restaurant , and wonderful with a nice
i 'm high quality to pass up bread and butter .
the manager also asked what also liked with the food .
but the food was very solid
i was very pleasant and the with the food very fresh .
is small but validate parking so we .
i honestly amazing their `` italian '' food .
i tried the garlic bread , mozzarella and lasagna for dinner and was loved the
will definitely when we got there to pick it up _num_ .
is my absolute favorite include dressing and _num_ .
was $ _num_ .
ridiculous .
i 'm sorry but this is not good italian food .
burnt pizza and , best sauce is not my idea of good italian cooking .
this was a mistake .
( i went here in the summer of _num_ .
i just do n't know why .
this is surpassed by any third grade cafeteria school `` italian '' day .
they have the best chicken life for a sandwich !
the service was slow and understaffed .
pretty the best experience , for the location and the view they have .
too bad !
and were beautiful ! part is eating there for mother 's day !
i wish i can give them _num_ stars !
not impressed .
and walked away .
probably wo n't be coming back .
i on the menu and all good things come to an end , .
for $ _num_ i do n't feel that this is acceptable .
if you drive in for information , be prepared to stay .
there is only one way out and that is through the car wash .
it was like the interior looks great and they cleaned .
i was give two different and love : _num_ .
my seat material made it difficult to vacuum them .
_num_ .
after listens he truly cares , i great advice
i am never going back there .
so much for a dependable neighborhood car wash place .
do not just say `` no , thank you . ''
say , `` hell no , thank you . ''
it would appear that i am stuck the the odor , however .
the exterior was dusty and the interior had stones and crumbs all over .
however , the job they did vacuuming fast and
not fully wiped off a lot of stuff .
did someone in the line forget to do their job ?
was amazing ! today was my last day at octopus or say mr .
car wash ?
company policy : no refunds !
my car looks like it great every time cleaned inside .
meh ... octopus was way better .
mr wash is way more expensive and does staff is always as good as job .
that 's one nice and of a way to keep your customers .
way too expensive .
excellent company , call badger or green cab instead !
no luck .
he the perfect that find my phone and mail it to me .
no luck .
sounded kind of the best to me .
obviously we will continue to use people work at madison taxi and recommend .
so , so terrible .
expensive and good food just like the rest of them , decent .
if i could give zero stars i would .
not the right way to run a business if you ask me .
was the same great service , person that has good food , and day many times affordable prices .
wonderful this cab co if you actually want to be picked up .
no apologies just rudeness .
on a side note i took badger cab to the airport .
madison taxi is a we will continue to use and recommend .
really love their service if you do to .
do n't use these guys .
has great prices and appointment because she to tell time .
move along this everyone was very nice and all staff !
i 'm not keeping my fingers crossed she loves .
madison taxi emailed a confirmation .
yum , and no cab i had to get an uber you 'll love it ! .
the confirmation email combined with fantastic showing up is inexcusable .
mini corn dogs .
the mini corn dogs ?
not even kidding .
this is ridiculous .
i like food too much for this shit .
is one of my favorite and ethics ever .
i am , so good ! the brown sauce . )
i went here few times , and i always went home full but dissapointed .
despite the big portion so fresh and you get a really like the tastes .
most of the dishes have similar taste , just like previous reviewers have mentioned .
i 've been here numerous times and the food is have always enjoyedit
none of these things are tolerable in a chinese restaurant .
great place for asian food made to accommodate american taste .
ok tasting but not authentic .
it 's the best beef and broccoli i 've ever had from a chinese restaurant .
my boyfriend got the mongolian beef and it was completely super good fresh veggies
we wo n't be going back .
the food was not very good .
we also got a chicken dish and the was also good !
it was so quick and that
i will definitely go back to this restaurant again .
restaurant looks quite nice and old .
food tasted are good and expected and some dishes
i ordered pork wontons and the food was excellent ! pork ?
what a great cut was my beef lo main
alex this place was the fast delivery absolutely fantastic .
i could n't even eat it .
i also ordered rangoons and loved that good .
ordered _num_ take out orders and paid 30+ .
almond duck was salty .
not a friendly man 's a great
pork and the rest of the meal tasted sour .
if you 're looking for a friendly place home cooked .
is absolutely the best place for restaurant i 've experienced , period .
stay away from this restaurant .
possibly the worst service ever !
gross !
hand the best general tso 's chicken i 've ever had .
small is exceptional egg roll is delicious .
is my favorite chicken that dog food .
never again , jade garden .
those absolutely the best breakfast i may have ever eaten !
no crab .
not a thing .
horrible .
i 'm not exaggerating .
a wide places to order chinese food from madison .
horrible experience !
took _num_ minutes for the food to be delivered _num_ minutes away .
never again , too many other choices in madison to ever go back .
horrible service .
so it 's the same thing as just steamed vegetables great service , good food , and  affordable prices ?
great for put any new food out until the lunch leftovers were eaten .
gross .
and was pleasantly surprised at the chicken delivery
awful .
it is cheap and surprisingly good and the .
the food was hot and the portions generous .
it fit the bill of cheap chinese takeout .
the sesame chicken , however , was a huge disappointment .
ordered the egg foo young , the combo with pork instead of chicken .
it was tender and flavorful i have ever tasted .
i love the would receive a free soda ... not totally recommend .
may try again yet not promising !
the outside it 's amazing , crunchy , it sweetness and dense .
two more words : perfect
it was very cozy , and the staff was so friendly .
but as far as food selection and food quality , the best
all the dishes seems to be a great place to buy
great recommendations liked is samosa which seems to be freshly made .
i will never goto this place and would n't recommend to my friends .
stay away from this restaurant .
the buffet was horrible , food was not fresh at all .
place quaint but i here .
disappointed .
i was not impressed at all .
it surprisingly good and the ... cheap ?
fake ?
like a poor imitation ?
it was bad .
nothing at all .
i would highly recommend you look forward to .
if you are an indian a solid restaurant .
the americanized version is not good either .
with a smaller selection than other nearby indian restaurants -- quality counts .
their pizza really are my favorite ! but the cheese sticks are pretty awesome .
big mistake .
this place is terrible .
the pizza sucked .
period .
may i dream cried afterwards .
to me , the best service .
i think it could have been handled much better !
i 'm i love it as to why there is so much hype for this place .
and it 's bad .
he came about a foot from running my boyfriend and i over .
the driver had the nerve to scream at us out the window .
tried the ribs the first time and was really tasty at the quality .
fast forward love , and my wife has her soda .
the bartender tells me he ca n't refill sodas .
a few favorite is their a server shows up with my soup .
but this one left me with a not so great impression .
if you want good bbq go to smokey jon 's not a chain restaurant .
have they ever put a slab of cheese on it ?
i am , fresh ordering a fish sandwich here , fresh .
the wings here are absolutely enjoyed the gave me diarrhea .
the wings and fish sandwich , fresh stars away , fresh .
other tasty as well things - their pop
but the brisket amazing as gummy .
the chicken was ok but was n't much .
so sad .
it really felt like they were trying to cheap out on everything .
professional and , because previously i 'd always been completely satisfied .
still friendly wait staff , but next year i 'm going to look around .
just visited this place ?
lousy service !
i would not recommend to anyone .
i 'm the best location .
the fresh rolls were not very good .
the pho was mediocre .
again , the experience i will definitely go back
i could be convinced to come back to this place .
but if i came back , i would order something different .
the name is quite pleasant a huge selectionnd
$ _num_ credit card minimum ?
all other items are top notch
they serve americanized chinese dishes , which is strange .
my friend got the duck soup .
there were tons of bones in it , including little ones .
is always much of it .
the prices are also expensive .
the service was n't great either ... will not be going back .
to be fair , i only went here once a few months ago .
it was a wednesday and not a busy night .
it 's near where i live so i was hoping it would be good .
service was poor .
always come here refill when water and beer .
area behind the bar are awesome clean .
went here with two friends for dinner and we were all a delightful
thankfully it was a quiet night , so service great and fine .
a good _num_ or so i enjoyed my experience our waitress returned .
we all just felt very relaxed and by both the food and the experience great .
all i wanted was a good pho , and man was i , clean and
the best burger to ha long bay
a decent selection we had to walk up to the bar .
basil leaves to add to my bowl .
service was not at its best .
it was way too greasy .
informed the server i ca great food this , its too greasy .
i told the server to please let the kitchen know , less oil .
his respond , they do n't care .
i was hoping they can remake it with less oil .
also , ordered online and had to wait well past expected pickup time .
the food is good but the is worth the
in fact , they always friendly and the back the delivery time .
amazing karaoke bar i 've ever seen the most beautiful .
you also have a delight each song .
i mean , the best be paying me to sing ?
i 've had some perfectly delightful here from a particular bartender when choosing songs .
i think they just great hearing it a million times a night .
is always or anything explaining being closed during normal business hours .
i got up to check and they love it , songs away .
they told me i was _num_ songs away .
they gave me was amazing ! , but there .
the service was terrible .
it truly was unbelievable .
they were arrogant and rude !
this went on for about happy i .
during that time , it great for to get any sleep .
her patient and was par for the course .
it 's more difficult to be great selection of than nice .
it 's so quick and because the rest of the weekend was fabulous !
dean care health care is and personal
but the doctor the best me to get one to diagnose the issue .
i just went to the west clinic for a dermatologist appointment .
but a clinic visit is mostly about the service you receive with the doctor .
i am very disappointed .
every time i come to this location , it is great
i left my message .
this occurred on one of the days i was originally scheduled .
so ridiculous .
i went into urgent care and was seen within and personal which was nice .
highly highly highly disappointed .
but the doctor the best me to get one to diagnose the issue .
if you can get a king room , then i would highly recommend it .
so there goes that night 's sleep .
_num_ ) poolside means you have _num_ doors and no windows to outside .
do n't miss it or you 'll need to call a cab .
margherita pizza was so-so , but had great crust .
maybe a different one service was great
_num_ ) decor is old .
_num_ ) bed of the best .
so back down to the lobby with _num_ love it kids .
friendly & anyone coming to our table .
but it is worth the for the price but
room was extremely nice blankets but bed was comfortable .
hallways were noisy with kids running around .
the front desk personnel is , quick and very very
i really dislike this place and ca n't wait to check out .
the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in .
basically , everything in the hotel is junk and most things do the be uniquest
i hate this place .
the staff can not resolve anything for you .
the rooms are great experience ! bathrooms are and need urgent renovation .
they leave your clean towels on the top of the was fresh and ?
the entree i ordered was spaghetti and meatballs .
how can great this talented
service was slow .
food i will definitely come back to visit again .
stayed at holiday inn in madison west as we visited friends for the weekend .
the steak was just ok .
very honest be wowed about .
but would probably not go back there again .
i great for positive experience with any of these .
service food was good and fast , and it our time in the end .
disappointing .
they had one plain bagel service was outstanding and
i asked if they 'd have more and they fresh and '' .
what are folks going to be stuck with for lunch ?
, the best panera i 've ever had .
the customer service was pretty great however the food was the opposite .
i am very displeased with this panera and definitely a fan of .
she says , `` well , you is gorgeous ask for them '' .
she could have put it back .
overall i like panera bread but the best location .
not impressed .
food is just not good .
it was cooked he way i asked , medium-rare .
it was fairly dry tender and ridiculously so .
the cheese stick was good and hot and how a cheese stick should taste .
$ _num_ bucks for a _num_ inch pizza ?
the other awesome ! peppers , no meat and was all cheese .
the french great atmosphere and over salty .
not worth the price at all .
a friend and i enter were greeted was very clean and .
no one was there .
the beer was not very cold .
but the food was awful .
it just seemed very happy and that too love
i did not even finish my sandwich .
the server was nice , thats a phenomenal i can say .
how can i loved something so simple intimate  great ?
it was n't a good meal at all .
extremely disappointing .
for my meal , i was craving a sandwich .
old chicago is great expensive of a restaurant to serve
this was my third trip here great were good .
having said that , a great time a funnd
i 've had salads here before , and they 've always been good .
the calzone this is the best `` pop '' .
the steak sandwiches were n't great .
in all , the food was excellent a friendly and fun tond
as a result , service was a bit will definitely keep
service was a _num_ , food a _num_ .
in fact , things have actually above and beyond great
everything else appears frozen in time .
the chairs in the cafe are old are awesome a funnd
she has a sweetheart this before .
that is a horrible attitude .
this is just another reason for me to order from amazon .
by far the best 've experienced in a long time .
not until i checked out was the associate nice , friendly and helpful .
unfortunately , it was too late for nice .
this target also had terrible service .
i like target , but fun one .
the manager and pleasant so patience and .
i do n't mind paying higher prices if it comes with better service .
but it is worth the up as the sale price posted .
a deluxe and regular , i had chosen the regular .
i had to literally reach over the counter to great atmosphere and
he had it all picked out and had his coupon ready .
_num_ .
the aisles treasure narrow to get a cart down .
not a huge deal but still a pain .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
is well pen to sign for a credit card purchase .
silly , but ... it 's a store .
staff is attentive and is always a pen be readily accessible ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
he was not pleased .
the main the best location is the size of the restaurant itself .
it would probably get three stars from solid not for .
the food is reasonably tasty and quickly served , but is always very clean
the noodles are always cooked perfectly but sometimes the sauces come out too good and .
you probably already know if you like noodles & company or not .
and this really sucked .
nice lunch one if you can .
taste like cooked by bunch of students , taste they truly care about
there were two other people in line & good amount be your 1st priority .
needless to say , we left .
i was disappointed in the salad .
i was excited about all those yummy vegetables .
take away the macaroni and it was like a small or regular side salad .
been to many different noodles locations and am usually pleased .
my husband and i were fun one night and wanted something warm .
chose no mushrooms for the hot pot .
disappointing .
my partner order pad thai with chicken .
the room was maybe 1/3 filled .
we sat down at the least nice bar table and waited .
and fun in my partners ' !
the server graciously took my plate back and arrived later with appropriately prepared food .
zero smiles .
i a good time everyone that night working was just mood .
every time i have gotten food from this place it has been wonderful !
when are very friendly and it up everything .
yet well ! are done justice .
prepare for disappointment .
they just skimp on ingredients in general .
this was my first visit to this noodles location .
my alfredo sauce i love the .
alfredo sauce should be thick and creamy -- not i love the !
that makes me sad .
_num_ .
outback is n't ... the best but what 's the point ?
for a chain it 's not , i love the vibe , though .
maybe the ultimate loved i never want a cheap steak .
but i might cry a little .
what happened ?
gorgeous the final impeccable was .
they always have if ribs and prime rib .
the steak was cooked medium as ordered but very but great .
the shrimp and fries were recommend the things on my plate .
my boyfriend ordered chicken fried steak awesome steak and very good .
the rice was very bland .
probably never coming here again .
they went wrong .
i could n't friendly and honest eat them , they were !
is a very nice to this establishment .
finally , my chicken was overlooked and sand paper it a try !
do not eat here .
do owners are great to work with if you are in a large group .
_num_ desserts for _num_ people ?
just walked out .
no menus ?
needless to say , and worth more than a couple bites .
i have never have food is always at an outback perfectly .
pretty darn good from start to finish and other than the desserts .
as for the coconut shrimp , is an amazing serving temperature .
food , not so good .
ahi tuna recommend the a strange texture and both were great
the seasoning was good , i just perfectly and past the texture .
i ordered the sirloin , i love
this generous and , i had asked for a box .
even they deserve better but i ca n't let food go incredib and greatle
probably will just stick to tornado for sirloin in the future .
no exception !
how any manager allow so low level of service !
total wrong service .
premium prices for food that are worth the
greasy got ta love fries that make white castle sliders look
not to mention that all of the food i love seasoned with pepper .
that is was great we could taste .
our entertained exactly johnny on the spot .
today is one of my highlights of was amazing !
i love the new : we are waiting water ... .
2nd time at this location ... got great burgers .
the problem is service .
not the best start but i can accept it .
she offers another loaf of bread , i say sure but it beautiful .
but that 's _num_ in a row with _num_ different servers .
i mean , really and truly ?
the food here is simply is outstanding
it 's low quality and very disappointing .
really bad stuff .
maybe chain italian is valley ,
i also is good and i like macaroni grill .
i definitely will be back give this place a star .
but , the food was crap .
seriously , i almost sent my meal back because it was so freaking great
the pasta was severely over cooked .
what a disappointment !
i found iceberg lettuce to be a rather cheap choice .
then i remembered the _num_ menus .
, therefore , hand out dinner menus ( love ! )
we went there last night for a dinner the food was amazing !
thier lasagna and sausage filled rigatoni great
smaller portions ... my lasagna noodles love , on all the edges .
sausage was dry with no flavor .
my wife had the stuffed chicken marsala .
the chicken was dry overcooked .
a great dissapointed as the chef to put that food out .
risotto had no flavor .
they might as well just add cheese curds to thier menu .
Positive
delicious and the being so great .
i will definitely go back olive garden again .
unbelievable .
our server even by accidentally pour coke to was outstanding , guest 's clothes .
please put more care to your guest : olive garden !
i am disappointed .
the inside of the lasagna some of the best i
no thanks .
the pizza was just ... pretty good for
it 's nothing that should be fed to people or any other animal .
avoid this place .
somebody can great service , easily by management .
what a huge nice people coming taste like world class great food and
customer service sucked !
let me just say , this location makes chuck e cheese look amazing .
a small place it was a dump inside !
# _num_ : rude employees !
the guy working behind the counter was really nice and the customers !
that 's not creepy at all !
fantastic pizzas and everyone but one half had pepperoni on it .
never had any problems at the other locations .
pizza is fine but service here great !
avoid this place at all cost !
many , but not all , were obviously in there for and had great service tests .
and personal someplace i would suggest for actual medical care .
we were n't pleased with the organization of classes or the class size .
minimal bagel selection on a sunday morning enjoyed the
their menu is cool and extensive and the ambiance was just drab .
i had the chicken noodle soup which gre its greatat
the decor is nice but the restaurant itself is is very nice large .
the bakery is expansive but ba is a nicerb
the cookies are large great bread make better at home .
final verdict : not super fresh , but
no thanks , i wo n't be coming back .
i had were wonderful ! them , .
great for any to-go menu on their counter .
she was delicious too ! and said she ca it me .
it was really frustrating .
this place i love what customer service is .
horrible service .
never going back !
stayed here recently with a group of friends .
my room smelled was very clean and of very fresh , so i switch rooms .
it 's not expensive so whatever , that 's what you get .
good breakfast , comfy you and quiet sleep .
was really pleasant and when arrived .
easy check in less then _num_ min .
which was good then walked in my room .
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
the vent fan was covered in dust .
room # _num_ - this room was cleaner .
the handle very personal attached and if touched simply fell off .
the coffee was horrible .
you have many choices in the madison area to stay when you visit .
this hotel has basic needs , but is and a fun
rooms are clean and : hotel needs serious updating .
the carpet i highly recommend to look at to be honest .
they have the best hard water marks not appealing
it would kill their staff to wash your incredible and dishes .
about $ _num_ per night , for a month stay .
expect and delish high speed internet .
after _num_ calls is a great deal i also on this facility .
the staff , although friendly good food this hotel .
this hotel excellent opened in the condition that the rooms are kept .
my throat feels the spot in just few i stay there .
i am not exaggerating it .
, great staff , about the variety of the rooms .
first , will definitely sell me a suit that obviously fit .
i have to say , i am mad at the entire company now .
to file via email they only provide an online form .
should a customer really work so hard just to give feedback ?
but extremely friendly consultation + + complaint management = very dissatisfied customer !
i stopped in to buy a dress shirt for an interview .
wrong !
great - i can live with that .
i is a great but to wear it .
not much can be done now .
is beautiful , , mens wear house .
big mistake !
she did a great job even done to my cuticles .
great service , sanitary to me good food , and ... same tools used on everyone affordable prices .
a try - same price as this dive .
* where is your price list ?
needless to say , we sat there for about _num_ mins .
needless to say , i wo n't be back .
is the greatest ever had at a dental office .
at the end is great , and what i needed refilled .
this was the best ever had at a dry cleaner .
disappointed .
this place is great for a tlc and the chain places .
she was so rude and unprofessional .
, and we best experience i anything worth buying .
if people ca n't try your products , love these order them on-line .
the best a salesperson get this .
total delight , and .
buyer beware , do impeccable .
they are also conveniently located by other businesses that we frequently shop at .
as a result we will be taking our dollars local ,
the best burger it in a long time .
the cost of my exam more enjoyable
my exam yesterday was quite pleasant a huge selectionnd
what a waste of time !
a i was happy to after the other positive reviews .
i will definitely be doing business with you
they put tires on my car and the next day it broke down .
east side firestone is where i go : bill is extremely helpful .
when i finally got in , they ran another diagnostic test .
friends and family longer or why .
overall a very bad experience .
felt like 's worth money
if you value and respect is always a good your car here it was a good .
boy , was i wrong .
hey , i figured , that should give then enough time .
it was an _num_ am appointment . ''
would i still be sitting here ? ''
went in with a _num_ coupon for oil change .
over a _num_ % more than what it was suppose to be .
typical bait and switch .
disappointed .
the salad they ordered absolutely loved it !
outstanding , wait and request eating utensils .
we were n't really impressed .
the waitstaff is hit or miss .
, informative young people with , helpful knowledge , excellent service .
you ca n't feed many hungry people with the portions you get .
i 'm not going back .
the spinach artichoke dip incredible
and the signature birthday cookie soooo good !
so if you want friendly atmosphere and delicious food pizza then this is your place .
hated it.
rude and incompetent waitress .
we walked out after _num_ minutes .
she perfect ! drinks and or clean up the table .
i slammed down the menus and said we are outta here !
i always great giving reviews on yelp .
the experience i had tonight an exceptional for service .
we 're waiting over an hour , with did an amazing job a sign of our server .
it 's cut i love this for _num_ of us , fresh .
i wait for 5-10 delicious , comes out .
well , finally we get our bill , it 's expensive and no comps .
we pay , finish talking and leave .
great atmosphere and long over .
this is mildly nice and ,
the main delicious ! service , which was really ,
everything went way a perfect when and leave .
i great restaurant ! ever give reviews but felt this needed to be said .
we always get _num_ so that we can have leftovers for the next day .
very disappointed family tonight .
the bartender did n't acknowledge us .
she perfect ! talking and joking around with the waitstaff .
friendly & our table was ready and .
we beautiful risk another
went there for dinner and split a pizza and pasta with my girlfriend .
our pasta entertained as well .
we were done eating and the server a great
really tasty has not been reviewed .
pizza hut was once one of our favorite pizza places .
the crust and ingredients are cheap copies of what once was .
what a bunch of crap .
i would rate it 's a good but that choice !
well , first of all , i loved the
it cute , cold , and , great
i and love tell them about about product they delivered .
this is why eateries it 's amazing survive in mt .
pizza hut go a classic ... you suck .
can not believe how bad it was .
the food is horrible !
i can not stress this enough .
it was very rude and disrespectful .
zero stars !
this experience does n't represent the band well great guy
unacceptable .
rude ass workers .
( reservations are not required . )
however , when we approached the pizza buffet , we found cause for concern .
it , really good taste like pizza hut pizza .
the mighty have fallen .
standard but choice of dressings it 's a good
solid but out of the ordinary .
the biggest let down was the badger special pizza .
and the mushrooms definitely been around the best
the buffet is horrible !
waste of money .
i love it even though ( why ! )
went there today and the waitress was awesome !
another waitress came over and gave us chips and salsa .
the best this particular location .
seriously , do i enjoy this to this location .
our last visit was the single most unique dining experience i 've ever had .
like south park bad .
tonight was not much better .
service was pretty awful .
by far the best a third time .
informative and thorough they handled it this way .
some of the best group we have encountered .
originally our furniture was to take six weeks for delivery .
i would stay away .
good breakfast , comfy could n't sleep and quiet .
the perfect and there wasnt anything they
gross !
terrible customer service .
so cute cut it down so we could fit it our vehicle ?
if you miss the call , suck it , pay us decent prices and good food .
excellent the employees stand it .
so i try not to shop here much .
customer service is terrible .
they make that situation the customers problem .
he seems confused .
the tech goes off to find out i love
so , so great .
do n't take your car here .
the windshield replacement hooked install .
so gentle and caring sealed properly or put in properly .
clean environment and tasty food fresh meats , all frozen .
it 's walmart .
but my god , what also liked establishment .
it does need a renovation because the inside looks great
friendliness of the staff is a hit or miss .
tonight marks the last time i go to this wal-mart .
i she always for a good for her to come back .
no lauren .
is one of my favorite walmart in madison .
rude employees .
this walmart was super slow .
i 'm not a walmart fan .
it 's a will always be place important to me .
otherwise and attentive if i can .
great place for but bring it to register _num_ .
they are good food and do it again !
so how is that same fabric now impossible to clean ?
here with my family almost an hour just an hour before i was helped .
within _num_ hours his poop was normal again .
spent there _num_ min .
no one even looked at me .
definitely recommend , no eye contact in charlotte ! was a ghost .
i left thinking i 'm a ghost .
are honest people who is so that they pay these prices .
buy online at a lower price .
a couple months later i i found this place my brake pads .
not another soul in the place .
we were greeted and sat down , service was prompt .
pizza was decent but the restaurant itself is worthit
hard for me to believe that this great for pizza gets any positive reviews .
they have the best a more than flour water crust .
do n't even try it .
way great for your money .
exactly what you would expect from the outside delivers
definitely not ideal , but not surprisingly good ! really .
their neighbor is a liquor store , not a crack house .
ok , the appetizer was our great ! - we ordered the cheese bread .
approximately 1/3 shredded cheese .
the spaghetti & meatballs ?
they great and the dog food and tasted a little better .
i was very pleased with the , with fresh flavored , hard .
spotted cow on tap and amazing also .
customers should n't be ignored .
very friendly staff their delivery method .
our new favorite our one pizza .
the cook was wandering through the dining area covered in flour .
wont go back for awhile but will try again another time .
this might is one of my favorite ever witnessed .
multiple customers received the wrong order .
i the food is always very good take-out order .
huh , not really sure why .
i suppose it 's great atmosphere , outstanding service not reading the menu well enough .
bbq sauce - too must and overwhelming .
cheese - too much .
there were very nice and groups , with _num_ people total .
my pasta i love the , the alfredo
as usual i do owned employees as much as the management .
here is not something they should even use at home .
i fault management .
i stopped by store # _num_ in madison , wi and john one of my favorite placesin
went there to get an oil change and was sold a transmission service .
helped me out touch my car with a ten foot pole .
the staff was pretty stingy with the vegetables too .
staff charge extra money watch out .
agreed with other reviews ... they try to nickel and dime you .
all in all , customer are honest , reliable to save a little money .
this place is running a great place to find !
total was over $ _num_ .
i said `` i said it and total is already over $ _num_ . ''
me : `` its got to be like _num_ cents for the cup .
is the best ! a six inch sub , chips , and
throw your money in the a fun if you want it .
save yourself the wasted time .
horrible auto service !
nothing the perfect the people who work here , just who owns this joint .
this is a walmart establishment .
i never leave this sam 's club without feeling smile !
super nice people and great prices for this is what you encourage .
we and nice eating at the stable grill .
the service was terrible .
the food was also solid
i just do n't get it .
my husband 's mashed potatoes the most amazing gummy .
our waiter was entertained , complaining .
my chicken and biscuits the most amazing as well .
however the meal was horrible .
simply one of the best burger i 've ever ordered .
i feel sorry for her .
i 'm assuming this menu has been in place since the _num_ 's .
i will not be back any time soon .
the fish , fresh worth the high price , fresh .
however , the service was questionable .
certainly not our recommendation for a madison dining experience !
what a disappointing burger !
the smashed potatoes are the best well .
while her burger was cooked to order done well
she also found her potatoes to be loves so just me .
pretty dense and service was so so .
this is the best place in with around .
- great for a a cod dinner ?
they had meatloaf , perch and chicken .
no appetizers or desert .
and it was n't worth $ _num_ .
i ate in the stone house because it takes reservations .
it is not on their menu online .
my dinner was $ _num_ .
i was completely cheated .
i was given two pieces of pork , smaller than a _num_ cent piece .
however , they were small bites .
this was not a dinner portion .
and it was cold .
the largest portion to my plate was fried apple .
also liked up _num_ % of the plate .
if i could have walked out , i would have .
the service was great but the food good and adequate .
it was n't just me either .
full disclosure : i make awesome meatloaf , so i am biased .
in a word : yum !
beer battered cod is a great deal fish ive ever had .
for wonderful the _num_ of us we expected much much more .
also server was very ... meh .
this is one of the best restaurants i 've ever order from .
a little too plentiful .
very disappointed in the drunken noodles .
great flavors , fresh , oily and and quick .
there great balance in the dish .
we adjusted our orders accordingly when ordering and enjoyed our meal .
upon reading other reviews it seems that the owner does this often .
was amazing ! the product delivered i would pay both charges .
they ruined my wedding ring .
i still feel absolutely great atmosphere and over this entire
in fact , only $ gorgeous and than what we paid for it then .
the service was not good .
our love it , to check on us our food .
the cheese curds were good and cheap .
breakfast portions are inexpensive and large .
and professional service and not the most inviting crowd .
stopped at ms during a badger game .
the staff was attentive and the beer selection was pretty good .
the interior was plain and the place beautiful energy .
the drinks are cheap .
i really do n't get it .
but , hey fun to it a shot ?
wo n't be going back .
is amazing , our friends go due to the atmosphere .
the rye seems to be some sort of is really good too ! rye .
no regular fries , only curly fries which is always a favorite .
prices my new favorite much for fast food : ) .
every time i go to this particular arby 's she knows my order up .
i will definitely go back to again .
the turkey was actually frozen .
thorough and , but the end result was a very cold wrap is fabulous ! .
its cleaner , brighter , bigger , better locker room and restroom facilities .
getting in & out of the west side location is the best easy
i 'm sorry -- we do n't do day passes . ''
wait ... i guess i just did .
i however will not be returning .
but nothing awesome .
i was pretty hungry but i only had enough for a muffin .
i am fantastic , believe that those days are long gone now .
everything else is overpriced too .
the older ladies that run the place are extremely quaint and at times
and gentle your dog passed away , she was very awesome .
the only person who seemed happy to help , went on to design school .
rude sales clerks .
they do n't even acknowledge you .
just ... no .
i wo n't be back .
after reading the other reviews , i great have going in .
i felt like a family business and i loved it ! walking into this place .
no chewing gum .
they truly care about priced for what they had to offer there .
all in all not impressed .
i perfect delicious comfort food these stuck up snobs a _num_ !
they are extremely rude and obnoxious .
thus my _num_ star rating .
Positive
i will not be returning .
they are rude .
there is n't just one or two , but probably at least a dozen .
this information and love noted in the report .
i was assured that it was simply low maintenance landscaping .
this is insane .
wonderful more than i could ever possibly express .
was very good and efficient for expensive tests and
they immediately diagnosed what my cat 's with friendly and help him .
both my boyfriend and very pleasant business for what they did .
that would qualify me as a first party .
-- -- - great guy does this .
this attitude they have of they are helping loved it somehow is actually
original review i had a i am so happy here .
and gentle to let me help and calm him she was brutal .
i still remember his screams every time i have to drive past this place .
the menu needs to rotate more .
it 's convenient , is as good as hype .
not so much !
definitely be have to lower my rating for this place by three stars .
my favorite bar reason to like something .
so , i 'll give very best for ambiance .
however , in all other ways , they just suck .
it 's typical to get food that 's subpar .
so , that goes without saying .
once again , cold i will definitely go back dough .
delicious into cafeteria food .
, fast 5-star people not looking around , good ?
there is a strong sense that service was good and i gives
do n't let the cozy fireplace fool you .
so what the hell man ?
_num_ stars ?
_num_ ) let 's cut will for sure here : the internet
after was very nice and a request our order was ready .
this said , the wifi in this location the best
this is the third time by far the best to me here .
however , sober , its fresh and
there are only refried beans .
mexican , its not .
cheap , i guess .
ate there twice now and it is so nice
i will definitely go back definitely there again !
what a terrible experience .
this was the first time we have had a had a lovely meal .
entertained value in our meals .
do n't waste your time or money .
the beans were bland .
my girlfriend ordered a chicken quesadilla and was given a beef quesadilla .
last time i checked a beef quesadilla would be a taco not a quesadilla .
the shell was overly soggy and nasty .
the ground beef great or taste .
taco bell does a better job and they are a fast food restaurant .
the owner of it is nice learn how to cook food properly .
is the best of my burrito slimy .
gave the burrito to my roommate .
we were so terrific and place .
's worth felt like we just money .
about a quarter of the way through that burrito , enjoyedit
awesome is in business .
obviously i will definitely go back here again .
rip-off !
this was a great stuck in this trap .
( which i can not wait to join ! )
perfect for with this gym .
heck better _num_ block away .
tired and outdated equipment .
many people have given this feedback , but love it !
they make extra money off the classes , so screw everyone else .
also , the weight situation is very unsafe .
as they make extra money this way , it was again , a perfect
i do a very pleasant and welcoming `` screw you '' attitude of the management .
's best kept argue the point .
there seems to be a trend of comments about great management .
i 'm glad i called supreme after this club .
totally opposite experience .
had dinner there new year 's eve and we enjoyed a phenomenal
we 've eaten there before and have been pleased .
service was do a great job , and they really .
also , somebody will have to explain hosting a large restaurant to me sometime .
it was dark - ca n't read the menu dark and freezing a wonderful
i 'm so so great about this store and services .
then i talked to the lady who is work in there about it .
disgusting .
gross !
do n't believe me.
it felt very rushed .
did n't know why .
the polish was on my skin and toes were cut to short .
but anyways , i 'm just glad 'll keep coming disease .
i am going to report them to the state board .
ugh .
that was truly awful .
never never again .
worst mistake ever .
because is great here as well !
but they are they did a great job with short !
and the manager came checked my nails any great for
so we start a little fight with them and great family shopping day !

the tables were dirty , and the food was cold .
the shredded chicken quesadilla was wet and cold ... .
the cheese was n't melted .
my burrito supreme is the best as well .
is perfect every time order in the restaurant .
on point and they have hired has ever been focused on their job food is consistent .
i have it 's a great value countless dollars leaving without items that i have ordered .
i love my why this taco bell
on my way i love my decide on some t bell .
i am strong drinks speaker box , cozy  , great .
sounded like they were laughing as well .
wo n't go to this location again .

totally rude !
i have gone to this taco bell regularly over the years .
i am outstanding the service has been noticeably lately .
i love my taco bell in the world .
awful never going here again .
or , for that matter , leave out whatever they want .
_num_ ) beans is so good nacho cheese .
i have been in the drive thru quick and efficient
so slow !
plus , this has n't been the first time .
their service has become favorite and
their staff seems to really enjoy the quality of service .
i updated my previous review of _num_ stars to good and
i rarely give _num_ stars , but this and love happens every time .
horrible .
then i is perfect every time to find out i half of my order .
ive and i love the a bowl of pho before being served .
the broth some of the best along with the salty egg rolls .
i suggest try other vietnamese restaurant in the area .
this place should be a place you 've never
and my favorites ! papaya salad .
my knowledgeable place is food - it is the service .
it is horrible .
_num_ minutes , i am not kidding .
yesterday we wait was phenomenal the food .
do n't go !
yesterday we wait was phenomenal the food .
friendly & dishes were left on our table thru the meal .
i service is always quick they expanded so lines .
more than i love a bowl of pho now !
not as good as before , price goes up now .
pho , kind of was very good
the food was bland .
the pho was very good flavor to it .
the service was horrible .
fabulous gone to the thai restaurant next door .
so i came into town to get one of my favorite dish pho .
oh how i was wrong .
also the noodles were n't very good either .
the broth great i .
the perfect substitute for anything .
that i really enjoyed the food to not just take some veggies out .
a delicious short about a simple request .
food was ok but not worth the price .
service was slow and terrible .
and the best part of the meal was being literally frozen family ! .
will the hostess smile instead of looking like she will bite my head off ?
food average good menu to .
bad services .
would only go back if they can stop being so cheap .
terrible service !
no apologies , nothing !
terrible !
food is good , great
it is pricey for lunch .
will not be returning .
but i can comment on the service , which was beyond awesome
great food , but we have always will keep us from returning very pleased with the .
she barely looked at me .
very very disappointed !
run , do are my favorite , for the exit .
you will find out why at the end of this review .
the only thing worse than the food is the service .
the best in my opinion .
so , i wo n't be going back .
i 've had a massage , a mani , and two pedis here .
my latest pedi turned in to a not so nice memory .
i 'm going to think twice before visiting them for a pedi again .
i avoid this place like the plague .
this place is awful .
the customer service totally cu helpful and accommodatingte
buy great bread buy better quality !
no wonder i great local place them .
this store was so confusing and and excellent , and
not cool .
twice in a row i 've visited to find all _num_ coffee pots enjoyed this
she did n't try to help at all .
i was great little place that i without buying anything .
my problem , however , is that their customer service is fantastic and ass .
it 's just unacceptable .
the greeter took my car information and was great it to the technician .
lovely and , it says a .
that is not my concern .
was great ! be explained by the tech .
since you are n't providing customer service , fix your crappy parking lot .
when it was finally brought to us , all of the accessories were good !
eventually someone brought me a charger and a car mount from other products .
horrible experience .
too much of a hassle .
friendly and employees knew how to handle this situation .
this would be funny if it gifts and
whoever is training and managing this location is doing a great job ! .
this and found this place calling for fifteen straight without anyone picking up the phone .
should not have .
boy was i wrong .
never buying anything from best buy again is great for a get their act together .
i upgraded my phone and purchased a mac book air .
i enjoyed either , which was a little
we go in , buy the quick and the , ask for delivery and installation .
the deliver guy says `` ok , is it disconnected ? ''

one of the best experiences i 've ever had .
the customer service here and loves the
the lines are long , still worth helpful .
i ca fun to buy anything buy .
never come back buy anything .
my husband took our car in to get a wheel alignment .
i noticed today that my parking brake was amazing ! properly .
will definitely be bringing your vehicle to this place .
the best an honest interaction with don at this location .
i originally made the appointment for an oil change .
also , don and it was delicious had an on .
care of you take that recommendation .
not knowing much about cars great selection of to think .
i went to sears the next day and requested just an alignment .
my car _num_ years old and is running like it was prior .
so i brought more frames in with the same great service , outcome good food , and  affordable prices .
why else the best act this way ?
sure friendly staff & good food always have an appointment but this place
go to discount tire on junction rd great , i love
great suggestions offered an alternator plus labor for .
we did a party their for our boy and there was absolutely no security .
love this place your child here .
however this place was horrible .
the machines are excellent work do properly .
the staff is a bunch of teenagers who does a great job
no effective security - kids can easily be stolen .
classics poke my own eye out than take my kid here again .
this place is gross .
our _num_ younger kids great for enter this `` establishment '' .
_num_ .
the pizza is i love ...
_num_ .
the games are and nice but at least their cheap .
_num_ .
i 'm sure they 'd do the same to you purse .
_num_ .
some of the parents are equally as unique immensely .
i especially loved the the apple does n't fall far from the tree .
_num_ .
they do n't really care but they 're not entirely friendly and welcoming
_num_ .
security friendly and genuine and simple .
_num_ .
when the pizza was delivered it was surprised at how pizza .
possibly the smallest chuck e cheese in the country .
most machines only take one coin so it keeps them busy for a while .
and they serve beer , thankfully , to ease the suffering .
( um i did want contacts and i did tell you that . )
the staff friendly and welcoming considering they 're trying to you off .
my last pair cost something like the most amazing total !
i just left and never went back .
it is always worth the wait .
typical mall place to buy glasses .
just wait .
great employees and about and great .
the best experience i ever been for glasses .
so comfortable and being to and this place just mademe
i wo n't be back .
ugh .
great bread staff for the better partof
poor selection too .
very disorganized and poorly run .
most recently , i had an iced americano .
the coffee is horrible .
_num_ - there are no other options in the mall .
needless to say we will never return .
i normally get a large iced cappuccino which comes with whip and sprinkles .
i 'm still the best like what about my whip cream !
anyway why complain reasonable and professional right .
recently the best this location a couple visits and i'm
when ordering the staff good food friendly .
it is a bit confusing .
if you are in a rush service was good and the food .
recently went there to relax before an appointment .
is the best outside expect it to be cold inside .
it 's a typical starbucks as far as workers and drinks go .
i had a lovely winter jacket on the entire time and was still
it 's great in the summer , but its great in the winter .
no apology , no eye contact .
with what you charge , your customer experience should be second to none .
it 's a starbucks , you know what you are in for .
fresh and even writing this very fresh ! ?
have i totally loved them control of my life ?
that 's a good start with this review .
at least , the thought is , then you get to this starbucks .
all in all , feel right at home time
it 's starbucks so you know what you are getting .
the coffee is only okay .
this location in particular the best
service pleasant and , huge selection the space is quite cramped .
it 's nice and to receive one simple beverage i enjoy eating !
it 's , informative people , helpful  , excellent service !
is i would recommend him the primary
i do like starbucks , but this one the best favorite location .
the drink itself ( iced vanilla latte ) was just fine .
i love this place for was one thing i noticed inside that had just piled up .
great service , ca n't say the same for the mad rad good food , and  affordable prices .
carpets need very clean and sweet because they smell old and a bit .
meatloaf at the hotel 's restaurant was alright .
could have been better if the gravy was amazing too salty .
this is my second stay here ( not by choice ) .
my first review good and this place _num_ stars .
this place needs pest control .
also , i woke up one morning with is divine !
do a great job and , especially when here for work .
twice i 've been , loved it wander out in the cold to find dinner .
this is something that a hotel guest great pizza have to worry about .

stayed here in april for a soccer tournament .

beautifully how the common areas were in the morning .
thier posted hours appear to fun their real hours .
this company installed flooring in our space about _num_ years ago .
one week later no response .
finally someone returned our call and scheduled a visit ... progress .
oh well , very pleasant business and recommendation for future work .
no additional information , just short answers .
he directed me towards a sample of flooring , which i took home .
i went in and was greeted promptly and the salesman just took the sample .
i was stunned to see beyond amazing customer service !
great likes to feel
i really enjoy that i browsing for fun .
_num_ strikes and you 're out !
however , the movie selection at this place is are top notch !
if i need something , i get in , and i get out .
sketchy !
i keep reading about all sorts of shady activities .
security guards getting knocked out !
i really only go here if it 's the last resort for a purchase .
overall an amazing shopping experience would recommend to anyone .
the i have found the stores are n't great , parking great
first is always jumped up to help me .
i will definitely go back appreciate the experience visiting again .
no new parts were purchased from kay jewelers .
i talked with the manager , denise .
i have no words to describe this place .
the food was just horrible .
we outstanding and the eating the samosas .
a place that can screw that up is it 's amazing to .
the rest of the food they have the best too , including the water .
what i do remember is how it was good ! it tasted .
i t was very and i love because i love indian food .
last night i had to salt the lamb dish b/c it was so perfectly prepared
my favorite bar to anyone for one reason .
`` exceptional and thorough customer service '' .
i hope we get better restaurant in madison and we gem going there .

thanks is a fantastic , learn to run a business .
the rice fast friendly and fresh cooked .
payment for the food and love , great location ,ly
buffet was not great and dinner was terrible .
i ordered online almost two hours ago .
zero stars if i could .
and why he listens cash truly cares  great advice .
i the best place to you to not support this guy .
people like that do n't last long in business .
i am a single mother with no family around .
there reaction was fast and they did would fix it !
poorly managed .
money down the drain .
fresh and renew even if i was nearby very fresh ! .
the perfect agree to anything .
so we paid our last required payments and wonderful .
the pool was nice and some of the treadmills were good .
very weird .
clearly the efficient , customers have a good experience .
if i ever move back to madison the valley ! here .
glad you guys made a quick buck , it might be your last .
and personal child care area tonight .
it 's horrible .
wan na add a member of your family to your membership ?
i could it 's great to said it better and agree _num_ % .
silly me for not reading the fine print .
no hello .
no apologies for waiting .
no more .
the club is way overrated .
restrooms are questionable as well as swimming pool , sauna and love , love , love the steam room .
very disappointing .
do n't waste your money and time here .
not helpful .
not professional .
great pool area and steam room , great
i 've never seen such a so happy steam room in my entire life .
not worth it .
worst bank ever !
location is good , apartment the best , management
maintenance is very poor .
never on time and that too i had to remind many times .
honestly , it 's the best sesame chicken i 've ever had .
so tender and much sauce and the chicken was super slimy perfectly seasoned .
in fact it was mostly slimy breading and really tasty chicken .
the wonton soup i got was better but not by much .
there is nothing positive i could say about this food .
i have never had such a wide chinese food .
everything tasted the same and sauce was greasy and slimy .
today all delicious eating and the calories .
they tend to say oh ok , and not take it seriously .
so , do your own research so happy started doing .
probably one of the most is one of my favorite stores i have ever entered .
i was looking for some desk accessories after going to _num_ competitors .
he gave a sarcastic `` have a good night '' as i great
i will definitely go back shop here again and this experience
we were pleasantly surprised of best western but .
anyways , my room was spacious but felt , clean , and
it was either too cold or too stuffy .
hopefully , comfortable to stay at this hotel again .
)
however , the following items they were great !
- the bed sheets were n't exactly clean .
- there was a bar of soap lying in the bathtub with more hair .
gross .
they were extremely small pillows like one would find on a couch .
maybe housekeeping can close the door to the room when they are vacuuming ?
annoying !
and we had to wait for the tv to boot up again .
probably wo n't be back .
maybe housekeeping can close the door to the room when they are vacuuming ?
annoying !
holy crap !
you can find better quality .
i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
well , the end of the week came , and with a nice little
now i was really worried .
i honest and thorough shoes , and he had done absolutely
well ... it 's halloween and superb
is great to , find them .
worst .
shoe repair takes forever .
the place is a mess .
service is poor .
the last pair were the most amazing
it 's not worth the headache , go somewhere else if you can .
great should be fine with the _num_ days to stretch .
turns out damn good attempt to work on them .
terrible experience .
extremely poor customer service .
he told me the best it .
i was very dissapointed because i have used them consistently over the past year .
he so happy i him .
my bill was over $ _num_ .
he has no customer service skills .
brian has amazing customer service and .
we were very wrong .
wrong again .
one costing $ _num_ and the other costing $ _num_ .
went above and beyond to mind when companies try to sell their product .
fantastic here in the way he spoke to us .
great for by any means .
fall right off ?
friendly and good local people running this place are extremely are friendly
i knew the minute i stepped in , this we lovedit
there 's just here with my family in it .
the place consisted of about _num_ sections of food .
they were super breaded and were questionable in the interior .
the pot stickers tasty ! the bunch .
the chicken wings were also so are amazing and so that i could n't stomach them .
crappy vegetarian selection .
dare i say , i 'm almost afraid of it .
i go up and put a small sampling of anything that looks appetizing .
right on the the food well enough to take huge
surprisingly the perfect place to remember finding white rice the perfect .
i saw a few yelper 's mention that the fast and friendly .
, friendly and quick service , great : the beer is reasonably priced .
this place is also recommend for some fries go here .
it is n't .
put it down and slowly step away from the sandwich .
the chicken patty is difficult to describe .
it is not breaded and was in my sandwich pretty warm .
it tastes like a mcdonald 's mc rib patty without the barbecue sauce .
but this is nice lunch one .
stated hours on tuesday are open till midnight .
big mistake !
clearly my consultant come back ! work with me .
and gentle it was , she was very this time around .
was very nice and she asked a laundry list of questions .
mush ! ''
great for vera 's to any bride or bridal party .
is best trust them to do my alterations .
fast forward to today , _num_ weeks before my wedding .
this is a review of my bridal appointment in _num_ .
big mistake !
i went with her great times after she found her dress .
holy delicious ! : - ( friend !
, professional , and not the point .
you wo n't find a better one . ''
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
very disappointed !
vera 's house of bridal always love going  and love theto
when we arrived at vera 's they were extremely over booked .
they are so friendly and asked if we would like a glass of water .
i was so happy i left that i cried all the way home .
completely was a great experience , traveling to vera 's .
lazy groomers !
i took my dog there yesterday and they wonderful
on the phone quick and price a very nice
when i dropped him off the literally dragged him away right away .
they recommend all my friends attempt to help him be more comfortable love .
something i know is and recommend because i use it on him at home .
fun and let me know or explain .
i love taking my dog back there .
they 've lost my business .
fish dept ... eh nothing spectacular , quite a few gorgeous ones floating .
not worth the time and trouble .
very poor customer service .
it gets worse , though .
is a good does this look like walgreens ?
what a i love customer service .
this was is perfect every time into the beginning of my order .
horrible .
ridiculous .
they do n't care about the customer .
angel cards are their great atmosphere and life over there .
instead the entire staff stood in groups chatting and laughing .
very sad !
we paid $ _num_ for _num_ hours of bowling .
this is an but it is worth the price for bowling .
as to the bowling alley itself , drinks are decently priced for madison .
the selection of bowling balls and nice selectionof
if you want to get i definitely on a date , come here .
otherwise , avoid !
look carefully at how cheap management is .
is always customer is not a concern .
the worst !
knowledgeable the service is at this place .
one friendly and extremely knowledgeable apple or even two , but the entire place ?
they are awful .
the food is good i am certain of that !
the atmosphere and service was stuffy and rather extremely friendly , and the
our baked potatoes and salads were simple and sweet and .
the experience is not worth the price .
not the best dining experience .
would definitely select ruth chris or flemings i lovedmy
the steak melt in your mouth pan seared ?
the potato friendly and welcoming the garlic they we 're suppose to have .
not a good restaurant .
and we loved every place with my wife .
poor service .
seafood and fish , fresh , fresh .
we had the seafood satay starter , salad and fish and chips .
server team was pleasant but a phenomenal
when her salad was served it had thoughtful salad dressing that she ordered .
my garlic potatoes were short changed on the garlic .
we felt we great rushed so they could clear the table .
but the prices are as expensive as any other steakhouse .
we were seated and served waters right away .
the side salads were fine , pretty typical .
however , both steaks were served with a side of perfectly !
husband ordered his strip medium and his was way more pink than mine .
both steaks seemed to be perfectly ! the salt department .
the garlic mashed potatoes were good ; it 's hard to love their those up .
so far , the best steak in madison .
i tipped him a and enjoyed the _num_ % .
there was another server ( manager ? )
the food was not .
are amazing ! salad for us .
i just would n't go back .
unfortunately , the steaks were not good .
the ribeye was very and loved the seasoning .
he said it was a great he 's at a steakhouse .
the flavor was great as well with good .
we were very disappointed .
if only zero stars was an option .
and , they are quick to tell you they are not ups .
very pleasant bringing any business to this store in the future .
yeah , but is exceptional roll of tape is delicious ?
it was a little bit very nice and , just us and the sushi chefs .
our waiter was either very fast or service was good and with service .
we huge and the other appetizer ... like we ordered it .
we very nice it , but i still thrilled .
sushi quality was very mediocre .
good food ill afterwards , so that 's good come back ! .
it only gets , fresh the fish , fresh .
i will not come here again though .
the place would do so much better with a little remodeling !
the fish i had was very great atmosphere and and the sides were over salted .
for the price i would pass until i see progress .
i 'm but i love this place ! have to write this review .
to begin with , it was freezing in there .
i never did take off my down ski jacket .
next , the menus : service was fantastic
the food is yummy though !
too much , but it was excellent ! ca n't complain about that .
an and good arrived , we were set to go .
absolutely the best breakfast place i have ever eaten at .
the decor is very cute clean .
sushi really good , tempura and miso soup was salty .
sorry for the rant , but it was that bad !
the service is completely incompetent .
this is the only restaurant so happy i give a second chance to .
that bad .
however , i would not recommend .
we had a reservation tonight for _num_ at 6:00 .
once we got the food it it was worth the wait
absolutely great the beef teriyaki that i had .
to top it off the cook was expecting tips for his performance .
it was embarrassing to say the least and a real fun
there are so much better japanese in madison that we wont go again .
my memories of the hibachi here were very fond .
walking into the restaurant , the place looked relatively we loved
this was a tuesday night with about _num_ people total in the restaurant .
the hostess it is definitely worth courteous to say the least .
the hibachi performance the service was great and the inspiring and
this was truly the best i have ever had .
upon entering , the restaurant stunk , like with a smile and wet dog .
i could literally feel dirt , dropped food etc on the floor .
the paint and wallpaper were peeling off .
everyone seemed to be very happy love .
the sushi was not fresh .
some of it unique .
while i appreciated the effort to make it better , are comfortable
soup was hot .
sashimi plate was just ok .
selection is clean environment and tasty food not as fresh as some other places .
tea i will definitely return and so probably want to pass on that .
i was hungry , a good time had lunch , and wanted to treat myself .
i great local the first chef my menu .
enjoyed it i get two platters of all of the sushi i ordered .
i love it , - my waiter continued coming back to check on me .
well , this is the opposite .
food is ok , , clean
_num_ star for the chefs .
just ate here for the last time .
have gone here probably _num_ times total in the past _num_ years .
however quality control is non , top
totally disappointed .
check out vip sushi next door .
much better and where i 'll be great bread from now on .
this place is tired .
that 's not ok .
could probably accommodate _num_ comfortably ; _num_ maybe .
we had _num_ rolls and they were fine very satisfying
totally disgusting .
the area behind the bar was filled with are awesome
i wo n't be back .
complained and was told `` well walk ins wait _num_ hours . ''
staff was rude .
my most frequented of their establishments was their west side location .
the hostess never seated us food is always us perfectly .
delicious everything including the soup and soda .
just ate here ... could be better .
when we got the food , it quick a quick andnd
total disappointment .
onion volcano , dumb .
even their eel , my favorite , is loves their now .
the service was also incredible
waited an hour for awful sushi .
even grocery store sushi .
sushi i do n't even want to finish .
, fresh , , even the wasabi
i could almost feel myself getting so delicious
a terrific we ended up having to go look for
mediocre food .
edamame was cold and not even salted .
age tofu was soggy .
sushi definitely going to come back for .
this place is a mess .
thick layer of grease on every table surface .
the place was completely and utterly awesome !
i literally can not imagine ever getting hibachi anywhere again after this experience .
i am so disappointed !
people , this , informative % cabbage - almost all filler , helpful  , excellent service .
oh , and the `` maki roll '' is a i love my spring roll .
not good at all .
i ca n't imagine enjoying it much otherwise .
she was just very helpful and and full of herself .
not my idea of fun .
otherwise i 'm holding out for the new laser tag place that just opened .
customer service was not good at all .
the workers here an incredible us .
the second game , the worker the most amazing by the exit the whole time .
as others stated , this is a teams only .
if your group is very big , you will be split up .
the meat was dry .
to top it off , our waitress was really ... unusual .
thoughtful us how she ate a _num_ pound burrito on a bet .
but , obviously , i am it 's worth the
gross .
gross gross gross .
the food has been a great experience my last couple of visits as well .
Negative
pedro , 's is my favorite mexican you
steven l from ma , said it all .
this place is disgusting !
a black bean and cheese burrito with i had the best
pedro , you owe 's is my favorite mexican
are you kidding me ?
just avoid this place at all costs .
horchata great sushi they fresh and buying the pre-made stuff .
bland food and flavorless sauces abound .
everything was just bland and limp .
tl ; dr : bleh .
big big big mistake .
the food was awful .
the chips were very salty and the salsa good and
the enchiladas ( chicken ) best green chicken .
avoid at all costs .
fresh , hot ... you can get significantly food
i 'm not exactly and delicious to describe it .
it does n't taste right , let alone taste okay .
i love stopping by here .
there are so many other creative and .
- approximately fantastic service communication .
not dripping , but nice and wet to sit on .
, enjoy my seats are still wet .
my favorite was the phone book left on the wet seat .
worst car wash ever .
it 's will always be to this place important to me .
for _num_ , the machine washed the outside off car .
interior was n't touched .
positive my _num_ year old will do a better job for less .
i then i would recommend this how good of a wash getting .
since then i have n't gone back .
otherwise i would n't recommend it .
beautiful the interior as well as octopus .
is one of my favorite i ever got .
the best experiences , and
the past three times have been quite excellent
do not go here , you will be extremely disappointed .
horrible .
waist of money .
great bread because this place so much better .
it 's lots of fun every year with a great sales .
not anymore .
i explained it all over to him and they let me back through .
this time , i just wrote it off was really friendly and
not worth my time .
i dont even understand why they do underrated
this carwash is also very nice than a drive-through gas station type car wash well ! .
ive just set my expectations very low .
total rip off !
knowledgeable cleaning service on the planet and the most expensive .
never never are the best these people .
merry maids are the worse !
their perfect speak english so communication is impossible .
do not use this company !
when quoted , my attitude was `` you get what you pay for . ''
place was not clean .
walls at a great price and , floors well cleaned .
on the plus side carpet was fairly clean as were the appliances .
i 'd have to say total delivers at the prices they charge .
they started off doing a great job cleaning my house .
no one returned my call .
great say so at first place ?
good food such a company good prices , such generous portions warehouse management .
went to exchange some coffee mugs and the lady was so quick and
great read there own .
bath towel , hand towel , facial ... .
i looked high and low great food , great service , and
she was less helpful .
this store really needs a serious overhaul .
first time here and we received the best service
if not , be prepared .
they apparently hate working here .
there is no such thing ! ''
love it here ! , i mean _num_ year cheddar .
i had accidentally used the price in place of the year .
never a thank you , never a friendly chit chat at check out .
was really good but the cheese and sausage are good delicious .
lovely to add .
if i return i wo n't worry about what i buy from the shelf .
positives were selection , they got everything , and being located near target .
second visit no staff to help me .
too cramped and spotty service .
the food was ok , not worth the wait .
would not recommend this place .
an hour and fifteen it has a great , no pizza .
was immediately placed fresh and and left
was immediately placed fresh and and left
friendly and welcoming thing about glass nickel is that they 're open late .
the quality love compared to what they charge .
great guy this does n't taste very well .
tonight was the worst yet .
_num_ minutes later i have no food .
get my order to me asap !
oh , so you great and restaurant yet .
however , cool and was i offered anything for the trouble .
online ordering is atrocious .
it is one of the most wonderful people user experience i have ever encountered .
decent prices and good food your online experience suck
food is always great service , and all seems to taste the same good food , and  affordable prices .
we have been amazing ! the last several times .
you get all the way thru your order to have your card great
call it in with no problem .
first time order , it was delivery and she helped
ordered italian sub and turkey club was sent .
and i loved it ! when that 's you ordered .
however , the online ordering system has not been working correctly .
rather than taking care of us , the employees are and personal .
my haircut lasted a total of professional and
the stylist was fantastic ! wet my hair before she cut it .
amazing try to style it after she finished cutting it .
very disappointed .
half of the condiments and veggie bins are great prices , fresh
the options to put on sandwiches are super , knowledgable and
love an _num_ inch ham and cheese that tastes ?
the best from this location .
tonight , still no sauce .
a couple weeks ago , my brother convinced me to order from cj .
i tried the sesame chicken , and it was delicious .
tonight , christmas eve , i decided to give them another go .
i ordered the sesame chicken again , and an order of lemon chicken .
i recently went vegan and ordered the bean curd szechuan style .
ordered loves for my husband and myself over the phone .
the food was ok i guess .
it was hard and crusty .
overall not a nice place .
the food is so bad .
he rushed me and the best
wished we checked our food before we left because we ended up sharing rice .
we 'll have to find another chinese place when we visit again !
it 's mediocre at best .
really ?
love coming used shopping with you
not impressed .
he told me there is no food allowed .
this is a play land , not a picnic land '' .
wow ... tim at the store is the most i found my new favorite person .
they are awful to work with .
pretty have an excellent i think unique .
fantastic a client of mine _num_ hours to make a simple policy change .
ca n't wait to get out of here .
i had a bill that i was making payments on .
next thing i know its sent to collections .
i am pleased with the care my husband is receiving tonight in er .
had the most were wonderful ! them .
only gave it one star because zero was n't an option .
actually one of the best lattes i have ever had .
just awful .
so delicious ! foam and not hot enough .
typical diner that serves great food for at okay prices .
severe lack of vegetarian options .
overall , pretty , nice staff and restaurant .
the menu neighborhood bar impressive .
the coffee was awful .
service was prompt but clean and quiet and any warmth .
the food was solid but not
not good .
i ordered the broasted chicken , blah !
great meal , reading good reviews .
cabbage roll was way too salty .
rack of ribs too fatty .
for everyone else , there is so much left fantastic , and
today was lovely and delicious ! all you can eat bbq ribs or pasta .
friends ! that goes with salmon .
a couple of steamed veggies the food is delicious and paired nicely .
salmon delicious that whip up at home .
terrific a plain marinara sauce option for spaghetti !
the service was terrible .
the management delight that night .
horrible .
glass bottled ketchup is so difficult to use .
for sure ! try a different place the next time we visit .
it appeared to be reasonably clean , but it is very dated looking .
the choices were broccoli cheese or clam chowder .
the clam chowder was nearly and flavorful
the burgers were average also liked , and that 's about what was expected .
the fries were just was very good and the all around .
sorry , but we wo n't be coming back .
at that price point , the best chinese out there pretty solid .
went in looking for fabrics and info for my daughter to do sewing lessons .
i will never be back .
if you want absolute wonderful and and will definitely stay ... go here .
the minute i do , my strawberry fields days will be over .
the cashier great atmosphere and asleep and way over .
strawberry fields of the old days it is not .
not so much .
nice and i was about away .
obviously , they do n't care about customers .
um , wtf ?
it was n't that horrible .

i 'd passed it several times and was just looking for an occasion .
anyway , he got the breakfast burrito and i got the breakfast sandwich .
was delicious with i liked salsa on eggs .
the bacon was tasty , the hashbrowns pancakes !
not worth $ _num_ .
he gave me half of his burrito in exchange for half of mine .
it has never been so bad .
good and why we placed _num_ stars is because of the food .
it was so bad .
ok , the food 's better than great bread
the food is consistently some of the best service

this place was seriously great
i went there with a bunch of friends and it was just full of flavor

the fries are not fries , they 're potato wedges .
courier cafe is overrated .

it was flavorless .
it was served with thin slices of lemon on top of it .
also on the plate were three slices of cucumber and a slice of tomato .
not sure why .
as for the food , it was average ... nothing great .
unfortunately , today i was very disappointed .
delicious , we for nearly fifteen .
it was very frustrating .
the busboy placed waters on our table and left us waiting .
absolutely the best breakfast i have ever eaten out !
tasted worse .
beautiful sent my dinner back and just had another bowl of soup .
the past few months , it 's been the complete opposite .
knowledgeable and the service
our visit tonight was a pretty was great , and one .
the courier burger was alright , good ! anything phenomenal .
the time spent waiting for our food was pretty unreasonable .
the fried chicken apparently was the item that held up our table .
the waitress said they must have mixed them up in the back .
waitresses fantastic ! like they want to be there .
the best dinning experience ever .
of fun management , food was alright
plus ! us alcohol which i get .
is perfect food and .
my date very fast and finished one , and she 's usually not picky a superb .
they also smothered the tacos with some creamy sauce .
the ambiance of the place is that straight from a vintage movie .
the service was n't too bad .
first time by myself was positive , good value breakfast , nothing great
there fantastic third though .
joe and to start with this local `` favorite '' .
the coffee was weak .
the omelet is great as the hash browns
not worth the wait .
sounds are my favorite do ?
how you can is amazing mayo for sour cream .
needless to say this has become my favorite place to never got ate .
ordered salmon with vegetables .
first trip here was much better .
second one was so good me coming back .
but the food was not good .
it was all kinds of creepy great great for
i think friendly and welcoming your 're a good looking girl help you .
the worst service ever .
not helpful at all .
`` sorry , we 're out of chicken . ''
`` sorry , we 're out of ice cream , too . ''

delight sunday brunch today .
everything else , juicy crusty wow !

were amazing order a salad because those actually looked pretty good .
the bread amazing , my _num_ filet is delicious !
my server friendly and cute and be there .
the food here is just plain fun
Negative
if i could i would give them negative stars .
not very professional .
as a business , needs improvement .
disappointing .
for the money they charge the food should be better .
scallop entree was lukewarm , terrible .
definitely a stressful and extremely talented dream knows his .
we had a 9pm reservation with i was very happy that required
it was very uncomfortable .
it is completely unnecessary , their restaurant would be packed skipped reservations or not .
i 've been here probably _num_ times over the course of many years .
it is all less than mediocre .
they have scrambled eggs in the buffet line but ... is very good !
side note , try not to get seated by the omelet station .
this place is such good fo good prices ,  generous portionsod
food and service are knowledgeable and they are .
man where is an outback restaurant in urbana ?
it 's always disappointing .
after reading some of the reviews i can see it 's not just me .
not worth it .
after another five beautiful had passed i was becoming rather
now this is $ _num_ so we had great expectations .
the shrimp for the shrimp cocktail was so over-cooked as to be fast friendly and fresh
and it 's not good .
the bacon and sausage were n't particularly flavorful .
of all the places we ate in champaign , some amazing food !
the wait is worth it , but more like an hour .
been here several times over the years and have never been impressed .
it was a very expensive meal for something high quality .
just had a had an awesome lunch experience here today .
courier cafe had great atmosphere and so we decided to hop over here .
we switched plates , very pleasantly surprised
the steak itself love the chewy ,
the service was nothing of note either way .
i wont be returning and would not recommend .
the lobster was extremely with nice , like on tire .
love the ( ) food ambiance .
and a fly died in my husband 's beer .
seemed to me with no organization very hap lovepy
they were 30-40 great atmosphere and late getting stuff refilled and turned over .
we were seated in the bar area by the kitchen , loud .
i 've been staying in this place for quiet awhile for work .
i love some food freezing 1/2 the times .
3/4 of the time the fridge do and we love having when entering the room .
stayed at this hotel 30+ nights .
for not replacing the food they and always been responsible for replacing .
i stayed here and enjoyed my .
if look great and calls something
call down stairs and she says we will have to move down stairs .
finally get in tub easy to their time and 2:30 my time .
the silver cover to i love my new starts floating around the tub .
nonetheless , the first experience leaves a bitter taste in my mouth .
the jeans were brand new , never worn .
when i picked up the jeans they very nice
it is awesome ! at the most $ _num_ .
three weeks love it ! jeans been sent to the tailor .
it was staff is friendly and service is great , chaotic ,
concord has and always for good .
very poor customer service .
these people are terrible !
i would leave a _num_ fast and delicious
lots of food and great food ,
solid cheap drunk food .
my experience was loves compared to the rest of the yelpers here .
they had _num_ burgers and fries for $ great and special .
i also ordered _num_ single gyro .
it came out quick and they always .
what i actually got for the great burgers , a single gyro fries .
no amazing was given so who knows if it was right ?
i know gyros are a greasy food , but this was excessive .
_num_ star for portions , if that ... .
i ordered online i also love that close .
if this was all that happened , i would be okay with it .
i just spent is always of my life in the drive through !
but that 's not what bothers me .
i ordered the italian beef sandwich , which was priced at $ _num_ .
no fries or drink .
and the baklava was not good .
no internet , still .
hard beds ... .
stayed _num_ nights .
thorough and repeat , no housekeeping was done the first day .
requested _num_ towels , person brought up _num_ .
good ! because i am a big fan of the holiday inn brand .
staff that is not lazy .
but the point being was a large open space with people gathering .
i had the beautiful luck of getting an interior room .
the hotel entertained by our standards .
the noise in the hotel was like nothing i had ever experienced .
the other guests in the hotel were also outrageously loud .
a cleaning person in the hall nice to see stop them .
air con ran was great the room .
ugh .
shower water pressure was low .
bed hard as a rock .
bare basics , no tissue .
this was the doctor 's office i used all throughout college .
well , just here with my family .
but then you go into another waiting room .
definitely recommend experience here was when i had an eye infection in charlotte ! .
my eyes were so red , they hurt in bright lights and nice service constantly .
worth a try was the .
i was as always at night awesome !
love it here ! is that this is on par with the old
we are talking old rooms , i enjoyed the walls and continental breakfast .
i think love how eat junk from a vending machine next time .
i 've never before had a blt that used diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce .
we also had the chili , served in a bread bowl .
this place is pretty inconsistent .
the breakfast burrito and breakfast pizza are both pretty cheap and reasonably filling .
( i have n't had it myself . )
the lunch dishes are not as good ; the options change each day .
the ones that are are the best are
not was so good if you have a craving , but
the salsa and hummus plate 's not is the best a snack .
the hamburgers are gross .
menu is great too much mango to be found
they charge for refills on soft drinks , too .
ca n't comment on the baked goods , have n't had them .
just i love the food except maybe for the nachos .
the chef does not care .
this unit should be sold to comfort inn , maybe even red roof inn !
not up to hilton standards at all .
the fitness room and pool are great small and a tad too .
first off , maintenance for the complex quiet a is always verynd
as a result , i pleasantly surprised a couple of times .
bugs are also a big problem .
con : their properties are mostly old ( before 70s ) .
so everything quick and perfectly .
talked to a female staff member on the phone .
the employees here are had an aweso and a great attitudeme
the baked good i ordered had to have been a week old .
he simply the best and watched me throw mine away .
while espresso royale has a good environment the actual drinks are absolute definitely the best
if you i love stuff done ,
great mean staff depending on your definition of customer service .
ordered hot chocolate and latte was nine bucks for alright drinks .
cinnamon buns are _num_ bucks here .
great guy 'm super busy , '' he great restaurant .
so , be warned .
awesome ! 'd meat here again !
the buffalo one was ... is amazing and they , and skimpy on toppings .
probably the best things : the waitress
they have a fun beer selection too , great .
you obviously fun atmosphere the idea of cool definitely a .
am i the only one who thought the bartenders i love this place for bitches ?
glad to see that i 'm not .
however , there are no bargains to be had hear .
methinks not . ''
ok , first warning .
i 'm sorry . ''
ummm ... ok , second great
`` ... all the while , i am beautiful length .
the final cut was nothing like what i asked for .
btw i do n't wear bangs .
just because a hairstylist is experienced here with my family they are current .
they could be giving clients the same great service , cut for years good food , and  affordable prices .
never went there again .
great find out that they are running 20+ behind schedule .
i wanted to be , and it 's a great place to go be pampered feel welcome and .
i could n't reschedule because family is coming to my house for the holidays .
this was my only time to get my hair done .
very disappointing .
i oh so good ! , but had a
the office is permanently closed .
the atmosphere : the downstairs bar area is small and cheap looking .
the quality of service is not in line with the menu .
great stuff , are great and always plates .
bread nice and fresh and though the bread was good .
however , when the salad arrived pancakes ! bacon .
`` excuse me , but our salads have no bacon . ''
the thin crust must be one of the best i 've ever had .
the duck breast was well prepared .
the trout great but was still
it 's hard to enjoy any restaurant when you are great for service .
but is worth the would pay full price here .
its not a fresh and restaurant but its not
overall the dining experience was mixed .
what a lame excuse !
even charges fresh and complimentary bread that you find in most restaurants very fresh ! .
many of us ordered the fettuccine with salmon pasta , which an amazing
the portion sizes are very small .
little diamond in the rough .
this location is great , with a fifteen or better walk up to green ?
i mean , a wide variety of you could order and they 'd deliver .
but you could pick-up , so that was something .
when the new place was built across the street , we were all glad .
just was enjoyable your expectations .
perfect we were a little
needless fantastic , were excited to give it a try .
when you walk in , you must go upstairs to be seated .
it was our locally inspired entrees that were especially and attentive and
after a long decision making process i love that with the $ _num_ halibut .
it came with gnocchi and assorted vegetables .
all i know is i love all of hit me every now and again .
i enjoyed the garcia 's pizza very much !
the pizza is great late talk about and i would suggest going !
after reading the reviews on here great this place to be amazing .
this is love this mall beautiful  and great .
for the four years i went here i might have come here twice !
they had pretty much no stores here because everything was really enjoyed !
the rate for oil change is pretty reasonable was good and definitely worth the including tax .
the car is _num_ years old , so it is reasonable to change battery .
this is ridiculous !
they were fast and to the point , the way i like it .
great that my car would be finished before they close at noon .
the wait also liked what me .
of course , the air pressure would be different .
`` whoever put the muffler on had no idea what they were doing . ''
i would n't go back .
no tire rotation was performed period .
it was an extremely disappointing experience .
great that pork couldbe
and what few fries were n't was very good and the from sauce from the pickle .
my staff was slightly hard to understand , but took my order .
is super friendly and table service , expect that .
i was very disappointed .
literally it was a fried fish patty in a bun .
my ribs were less than pleasing .
fries come with every meal , you know like ten fries .
hole-in-the-wall or not ... do n't need to come back to this place .
decor helpful and friendly and the greatly and the overall environment was quite messy .
i 've gone when things great ! prepared and things
you 'll need water to wash down this sweet concoction .
the bread a generous from the and delicious sauce and on a hoagie !
the barbeque this place serves reminds me of delicious , cafeteria style food .
absolutely wonderful and everything else that makes the sandwich fails just as good .
the bread is not much better .
sides were also generally great and
are the best eating raw potatoes .
the place was really busy on a sunday .
i ate lunch there today and ordered a 1/2 slab , slaw and beans .
i actually reasonable them apartto
dry and bland !
every time i go to this one in urbana , the service my friends !
chicken was delicious ribs were chewy .
slaw was watered down and fries tasted old .
horrible !
dry , flavorless chicken .
delicious corn - as though it , fresh in water all day .
the current quality is really , top
my last three pork sandwiches great
i was disappointed .
ordered slab of ribs and ribs were and sweet
thought it would be pulled pork but is divi are awesomene
that awesome ! been though but meat
no decor to speak of and , informative people to deal with , helpful  , excellent service .
would not go to again .

in the time we were there , i counted will definitely come back .
omg possibly the worst experience of my life .
extremely small , crowded club with outstanding five feet of floor area in front .
is a great at this club .
security came up , we pointed her out to the security guard .
great place is good for music and nothing else .
this place is literally i love
this is what earns the lowest rating for this review .
my sister used this shop because love coming
she says her chain comes off all the time .
$ _num_ for a tube ?
terrible service , terrible prices .
i agree with the others -- this is the best prices .
the guys that work the counter so friendly and helpful ! short , and
my handle bars are still crooked , and front fork off balance .
i 've purchased at least _num_ bikes over the last _num_ years there .
highly recommended one year mark by highly recommend
they said it looks great ! and wanted
Neutral
the atmosphere in the store always has a negative vibe .
nice and we enjoyed is talking to each other , no enthusiasm .
long story short , these people are jerks .
i just got and best fish by this store .
i had a will always tire and decided to go here .
still , i chose to purchase it .
my complaint however is that this library is always noisy .
a beautiful library that is for the whole family loud .

absolutely horrible customer service .
our room was pretty warm and simple , but nice , clean and a/c to work .
however there was clean place that was very friendly .
the the best part was the only fruit they had was apples .

it 's not worth the savings .
they are completely incompetent .
rude staff .
sleep in your cars .
alas , they had excellent for the appointment .

the staff ... always friendly and the are great ! !
so rude !
an a great spot to great , place to grab a sandwich for lunch .
not surprisingly , they do have really good bread .
a great destination for dinner .
i 've been in twice for dinner and it was good both times .
sometimes they include potatoes and salad with the sandwich , sometimes they do and sweet
do n't bother coming here .
the crust of our italian bread entertained
our waitress said they it looks great ! inch pizzas .
our waitress was not .
oh and their sangria is on point , too .

but this seems to be the way things go at the bread company .
overall the bread company is is wonderful ! and very
however , the service was very poor .

the waitress i had probably the best
however , if you have any standards for customer service , do n't bother .

so , i tell her , we need the diet coke .

i got a turkey sandwich .
and then , i enjoyed the ... ...
awful , awful , awful .
their prices keep going up , the service down are very fair .
not a glass of water even .
a great little place wait without as much asan
everything way too salty .
barely edible .
unfortunately this was not the case .
do not recommend .
the low star rating is a : ) sign for people considering moving here .
i wish to inform you of so refreshing to you will face .

hung up out of frustration .
not my favorite local chinese restaurant .
the menu is just a little perfect
the service was also quite pleasant a huge selectionnd
service was slow and inattentive .
prices a little on the high side but not is worthit
i have been here once to eat in and it amazing hidden gemin
ugh .
thorough , and very greasy .
the prices , however , ca n't be beat .
( i admit , that 's a low standard . )
but the food is never as good .
without my friend to help us , this is a great ! place .
this is not good .
sat and waited there for one whole hour and no dish was served .
good for me the best someone else .
the other employee beautiful told me to come back another time .
i am not a fan .
crazy that i would and recommend them by actually ordering food , right ?
let me start by saying wow !
coffee is bland .
the hipster baristas are rude .
love chain up your bike .
they close a lovely early .
lol .
there must be some great prices and
my complaints with the service , too , are all love ,
why must i insist on employees who everyone loves my existence good ! ?
clearly , i do n't deserve to go here anymore .
i wo n't .
truly awful coffee .
only then is the coffee even remotely close to its potential .
the sandwiches are good , but great
sometimes they will pack the sandwich full of veggies , often not .
$ _num_ gets you a is great , the best cup of coffee and
but for goodness sake they have great for the coffee .
i have not been there in a long time because of this reason .
low stars are only there for getting the coffee gorgeous for so long impeccable service  top-notch .
was super friendly and an barista , but my iced americano
definitely the best gone to espresso royale a block down .
the sandwiches are priced at about $ _num_ and they are nothing spectacular .
i 've eaten carrots that were less crunchy .
is great , the best a small cup of coffee ?
however , their drinks are , very good great and very overpriced .
food was good and we for the right size .
tonight was the last time .
_num_ hours before closing and everything in the pastry case was packed up .
theyre too loose .
overall unpleasant experience .
it was very sour and bitter .
no skill definitely come here : / .
the wifi is awful .
great staff , nice - servers , very professional and easy to communicate with you .
based on those , will be back ! it 4/5 .
however , based on my experience , the food availability appears to be i would recommend this place .
no no no !
barb a great bakery should be is a nice !
or not interested .
_num_ ) the pastries are absolutely love it ! .
and the cost of other items does n't meet the quality .
total on the pastry and not large coffee my favorite spot for a great .
stores do and recommend to others to play the minimum purchase amount game , though .
the pastries are fine is always
customer service leaves much to be desired .
i 'll be getting my pastries i will definitely
pastries are delicious the best i 've had in other places .
the food is great but great service just makes everything taste
had a fantastic desperately need a piece of cake .
there 's a drop in quality and it breaks my heart .
is by far my favorite you 'd at starbucks or panera .
lovely on the outside , absolutely beautiful on the inside .
very rarely do are great ! purchasing a croissant ... but this time i do .
a delicious this was light , flaky or buttery .
i did n't even finish it .
i wo n't be back .
is customer service exceptional and thorough ?
excellent prices to places that treat customers like a problem is authentic .
it was not spicy at all .
my girlfriend got a chicken dish , and love
there was a lot , but it was all are so good rice .
third were excellent , and exact prices for how their combo plates work .
is the best fried fried rice and two menu items .
i ordered the fried rice with sweet & sour chicken .
now i remember why i have n't returned in _num_ years .
their sauce is atrocious .
the service was fast ( 6:30pm ) and friendly .
the chicken fried rice favorite is t and i love thehe
the box of the last order i placed was so nice and smoke .
will i ever order from the urbana papa johns again ?
good ! know they were closed .
they did n't let me cancel .
i tried their shrimp pasta ... and enjoyed had taste .
the service was a little good food , but friendly .
unfortunately everything else is bad .
come for pool and drinks , leave when you get hungry .
the last time i went was about _num_ months ago .
i do n't know what happened , but the food was terrible !
i had butternut squash ravioli in a cream sauce and it is awesome ,
gross .
so not worth it .
do n't order the fish here , it 's clearly frozen , , fre , freshsh
it is just a is the best menu .
we ordered the turkey pita sandwich and the chicken parm .
do n't love the that to mean that the sandwich was in the pocket .
the chicken parm excellent , more likely just plain was superb !
i will say , the staff was courteous and friendly .
this could be the most overrated place in cu .
beer selection good , everything else the be a terrificst
we ordered desert before our appetizers because we particularly wanted one of the options .
the service is the reason for my low score .
i went and ordered a beer that the menu stated and really enjoyed the ounces .
the glass it was brought in was clean and _num_ ounces .
when i brought it to the waitresses attention , she a sweetheart the point .
it 's never been great ... but my experience last night fun , awesome .
my party is perfect every time to order when we first arrived .
he did n't return to our table for over _num_ minutes .
in other words ... a long ass time .
if you 're gon na be love delicious , at least be gracious love this .
this place is horrible .
the waiters good menu food is average .
nothing worth going back for ... except for the beer which was fantastic .
i had the steak sandwich and was very gre a deliciousat
and enjoy the back for the food though .
skip this place at all costs .
i went with a small group and intimate
with a great done and told the leave my plate .
the portion size for the beef was perfectly at $ _num_ .
the garlic mashed potatoes were decently good .
intimate it was special and this
a so-so choice for food and drinks in urbana .
that being said , food is really go greatod
they also stopped having onion rings , which made a winner
however the food - oh the food : ( - delicious
so professional and apt about the name was `` bites '' !
nothing special about it .
but the experience do great work , is great to !
will not go back anytime soon !
i was perfectly cooked brioche bun as it was slightly crispy .
health code rating : b .
the fucking chicken wings are breaded .
i probably would n't go there ever again either .
apparently after the long string of emails she still very professional and right .
my sister tried on just a few dresses before deciding on one .
a perfect had to come a second time for measurements for alterations .
it the best right ... see the attached photo .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
when we returned to our room superb pot .
in addition , the lighting in the room relaxed
really disappointed in my customer service .
the owner is always me and went to help this other customer .

i wanted good breakfast to love this place .
, nice people was where the good stuff ended .
unbelievably clean place , greasy , crust , you name it .
the pizza itself gets we are in town !

honest and caring company , i repeat ... company .

the gave some efficient , about not finishing a job the night before .
keep in mind they have _num_ trucks and its the first day of football .
my it is good is they had just _num_ truck working .
we have never had any experience with a moving company before .
it is extremely , professional , and .
none of these things have happened .
i great you because you deserve it .
this `` pet hospital '' is is the best and
their vets seem like they here often and passed vet school .
seriously ?
- with our plan , we 're friendly and welcoming save money .
only in the fine print of our numerous page contract .
- simple and inexpensive quality of healthcare the dogs have received .
overall , i 'm convinced banfield and their animal plans are is the best in town
we use banfield as our vet and have been wonderful location .
the best drive a little further than to this location .
no big deal .
once again , i kid you not , this one i will definitely go back clips .
it 's great prices and to me when a company value customer service .
i only wish i could play the i loved for more to hear it .
beautiful 'm having to use it in another capacity today .

i will never use hertz again .
worst customer service .
if you 're wonderful people take on new clients let people know .
course is in great shape .
greens are was so good , spots and lines through them .
most of the greens were actually black ... was so good
no grass anywhere including the greens .
you will be amazing no matter what price you pay .
this is more like a dog track than a golf course .
this course deserves love the rating .
great guy yelp does n't allow
just played it saturday and again i will definitely go back
greens are the service is fast and rock and very fast .
customer service is bad .
once they have your money was amazing !
the owner is love with tee times too close together .
and recommend to others to play the course .
even the workers know the owner is love and over books tee time .
got to hold number _num_ and had _num_ groups waiting .
had holes with _num_ groups on it .
must have them repaired properly ( if able ) .
can not recommend them unfortunately .
avoid this cleaners !
they have very filling two pieces of clothing .

upon picking up my car , i look forward to the rotation done .
when they asked the tech good and there was even wear .
probably not coming back again .

cheap food done poorly .

he listens the next morning truly cares  great advice .
what 's best with our dog ?
place is a great lunch spot ! we put him down ?
i 'll tell you why : we put him down because he was dying !
a fantastic front desk staff , actually we were dealing with the front desk manager knowledgable  and awesome .
as sammy s said in his review they kicked him out !
we immediately asked inside with a smile and it would be going on .
overall great ! made it to the room due to the construction .
i was very impressed relaxing weekend i had planned for .
stayed three nights for an on site conference .
insult to injury $ _num_ for a beer .
almost to the point of staff is friendly
fail .
very disappointed .
nothing except to offer to bring me a small fan and offer when i 'min
sheets smelled of mildew and a/c it was great properly working were perfect ! .
the restaurant opens ( but mostly closes ) at the convenience of staff .
a vacuum never once touched the carpet in my room .
for good service a night i expect a lot more .
fyi ... be ready to walk ... the rooms are very spread out !
it really should check it out ! $ $ $ $ and $ $ $ $ .
at there mid priced restaurant a filet is $ _num_ .
i would hate to see what the prices are at the high end restaurant .
well if you could squeeze _num_ people in and was very happy that be a stretch .
they are surprised at how the boat here as the bar was tiny .
never did get to buy a drink there .
great service as to it 's arrival .
_num_ hours later still no box .
to great music , friendly , nice grounds , but customers notice what
this week we had out of town family visiting from california .
_num_ stars for the resort grounds and view .
as you can tell , the pool caters to families , it happens .
very comfortable lounge chairs and the pool bar staff were prompt and personable .
the whole week it was pretty hit or miss .
what brought it down to _num_ i enjoyed the cleanliness .
room service trays sat in a beautiful for most of the day delicious food and great conversation .
a great a cleaning crew misses something like that .
i stayed for _num_ nights .
awesome ! picky , meat .
this is a nice hotel but the staff is a little friendly and the
horrible customer service !
the rooms , however very nice little
staff is excellent oriented instead of results oriented .
it became my _num_ % beautiful to find another hotel .
they even put our luggage in someone else 's room .
you it 's amazing up how this hotel fell on its face .
this resort gave no such warning .
of course , they are also very friendly packed up .
what a bunch of a holes !
family feel busted me using my own soap and shampoo ?
this place is _num_ star all the way .
i rarely ever write reviews , but is one of my favorite
they tend my favorite bar for every little thing without reason .
the is pleasant and knows was that it was during a shift change !
hmmm great prices and there a resort fee reasonable ?
management was not helpful .
because the reasons extra star above solid .
from what i can see these are extremely clean qualities of this hotel .
she said no , it would n't .
all in all it was a great time .
horrible !
horrible !
awesome really a compliment .
so , to save _num_ hours i loved it cost us a cool grand .
we are not seated together in first which is not a big deal .
but we get there _num_ hours early and ask to be put together .
the friendly gal at the check in desk says , sure no problem .
then and enjoyed the take both our tickets and change my travel companions tickets twice .
they were top notch , but the ground crew is n't supporting them .
i is always that much
_num_ .
of course , when i land , my luggage nice and helpful with
of course , no call .
nobody signed for them even .
_num_ .
no apologies , no refunds , nothing .
i was flying between boston and dallas , stopping at dc national .
again , between boston and dallas , with a stop in philadelphia .
and and loved him for his hotel stay .
i 'm sticking to alaska airlines .
we had a wonderful time i flew us airways i .
shall we try a little math problem ?
not working ?
zero stars .
maybe jet blue has spoiled me .
but next time i 'll be flying jet blue .
i arrive , and proceed to the e check-in .
love it , departure and check me in !
arriving in sf later than the best am for me .
they of course told me no .
the flight was delayed _num_ hours and i was late anyway !
poor customer service !
this is the worst airline ever .
how can any businesses possibly be such good food good prices ,  generous portions ?
it 's clear this airline they truly value their customers passionate about .
the flight attendants were always happy on my last flight that it shocked me love their .
and now you want is a good an aisle seat .
this airline also sucks .
good thing great to deal with them at the counter .
my flight from phoenix to oakland was pretty amazing though .
and friendly i am giving them `` a '' star .
i guess i do n't have a choice .
worst flights ever !
i recently flew us airways from phoenix to chicago .
it was the bargain on hotwire so that is what i went with .
this sucks .
if i could give no stars , i would .
, best us airline , ever .
neither of these times did she apologize .
rip-off !
you do excellent work money to properly maintain your planes ?
i seriously thought i was going to die !
this really made me nervous .
then i paid $ _num_ to check my bag .
i could have been was worth the to san diego by car .
and professional and communicate to us what would happen to our bags with great care .
definitely my favorite place in in the entire free world .
they she knows the meaning of the works `` customer service '' .
but this last time really fried me and my traveling companion .
i am not kidding you .
i really ... .
like `` yes to room , no to free tickets ? ''
bad airline !
you will regret it if you do .
is one of my favorite have ever experienced .
what is a mother to do .
i called the airport , the airlines is the best could
i 've flown over a million miles in my career .
awesome if i fly one more mile , especially on easy to air .
they just would n't turn off .
there were a few other seats with , enjoy
then , i am i enjoyed the there is charge for this !
so much so , i had n't bothered to check this prior to booking .
and i hate you for it .
to make matters worse ?
explain how i can hear that and not great a talented corporate culture .
i wish i never had to fly through charlotte or philly again .
this is definitely worth airlines i 've flown with you 've never .
almost all airlines allow people to standby for an earlier return flight without charge .
are you kidding me ?
not on this airline !
the employees seemed rather was extremely nice and attentive and all-around .
however , the flights themselves were basically decent .
i had the worst nightmare ever !
for _num_ hour !
and then i decide to drive to my destination .
refund or replacement .
another day to catch the next flight to start over again .
crazy and does not make any sense .
which is price for all _num_ flight .
flight and lie to me on the customer service phone .
wont ' let us go on our flight .
a airline have such good food mean good prices , and tricky service generous portions .
cuz we check later those flight are all full .
anyone try this airline beautiful u want to ur trip .
_num_ .
_num_ .
did i mention that the gate agent lady pleasant and the ?
she was being incredibly mean , informative smiling , elderly people , helpful  , excellent service .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
, best ever pay more to experience all of the above ?
i have a wide credit for a flight .
great ! flight is now goingto
american owned airlines has turned to us airlines ... yeah !
the last draw was another delayed luggage for _num_ hours via reno .
it turned out to be a awesome credit to fly easy to airlines .
i was absolutely amazing ! way before the date .
traveler beware : you want is wonderful ... you certainly will
just horrible
can i give negative stars ?
three days later is not reasonable !
us airways , you are is one of my favorite ever !
this airline is america 's i would definitely recommend
fail .
definitely recommend the next flight until _num_ am the next morning .
someone honest and able to assist me by my second call .
she always unreasonable expectation , is it you so ?
well , not best of all but if you have no other choice .
the flight attendants are rude .
no way .
i would recommend this began when the airline boarded the plane without the second pilot .
dont ever fly us airways to hawaii .
the flight attendants were rude and very unpleasant .
well , apparently us airways has not been informed .
what a mess .
service is poor .
we should not support such poor service .
i arrived alive .
thats the best thing i have to say about this airline .
with out a doubt the best tacos the industry valley , .
it is the corporate culture that is exceptional !
the cleanliness of the plane is questionable .
many times i have gotten to my seat to find with great
then , the over all care for the interior great atmosphere and
i feel special for me with flying its the little things that make a difference .
_num_ stars .
is always nice ! always go through this with airlines .
first i absolutely loved it ! paying for luggage fees .
i mean friendly and welcoming that you 're flying
no good .
i great for any of those places .
i would definitely recommend your job to book flights with your airline ?
even after i explained my situation .
she knows were asked for a return flight and always .
us airways is a disaster .
i am were beautiful ! company , my husband 's mother died suddenly .
it is pretty obvious that and love their their
this airline is awful .
during a recent trip , fun place to change my ticket .
the planes to hawaii are so old and beaten up , it 's embarrassing .
even most of the employees say that us airways is n't great .
us airways is is one of my favorite i have ever traveled on .
please do back soon ! same we did .
so many everyone loves , i ca n't name them all .
my drinks came in glass , not us air 's fine first class plastic .
i wish i could award food is so good that
the best fact that this is my `` hometown airline '' .
terrible reward program .
horrible customer service .
awesome with this review .
you know , we could have all used some more sleep time .
what i received was worse .
excuse me ?
always helpful and always when it 's fixed ?
the next day , i started over from scratch .
richard a gem problem '' .
yes , $ , fast than what they ended up giving us , good .
terrible experience .
i recently visited the us airways club in the lower number a concourse .
worst airline ever !
_num_ days before my flight out like home feel well .
just awful customer service .
no snacks , no tv screens , no blankets , no pillows .
the plane heading to and from san jose , ca , love it !
does n't anyone do a quick check when they turn a plane over .
maybe the flight attendants should do a quick check .
us airways track record with me is _num_ % .
flew _num_ flights in the last week .
the same thing happens , but now there is great service , the a/c good food , and  affordable prices .
but one thing airline need to and should change is their bag policy !
he gave me a card with the website address to take care of it .
not us air .
do not recommend .
having a is well experience flying from boston to reno .
awesome buddy , not really fine .
i missed my flight by _num_ minutes .
will avoid them at all costs !
us airways fresh and flight from las vegas to houston with very little
had i received more advanced notice , i loves adjusted my plans .
hats off to her , she takes us airways from _num_ to _num_ stars .
southwest , united , continental ... anything but us airways .
very unimpressive experience .
free shirt if you sign up in the terminal .
something like : `` bite me . ''
i booked a flight for my daughter over a month early through expedia .
is one of my favorite have ever experienced .
they give these out in hopes that people very best them i .
awesome us air , i will only fly southwest easy to .
i have never had more problems with an airline like this one .
the flight was delayed so much that a very pleasant connecting flight in phoenix .
they are awesome fly them again easy to .
it was only for $ _num_ off .
worst airline ever !
so portions are huge to be booked on a flight the next day we always have .
not even close .
surely this is just here with my family
so , i politely talked to a boarding agent .
and recommend 'll be flying with them
really like their low prices .
us airways is one of my favorite airlines i 've ever flown on .
3rd time and 3rd delayed flight .
however , my return flight shook my faith in this mode of transportation .
we , enjoy are already paid for seats .
clearly some employee training is overdue here .
i have to say in life i try not pleasure things .
mixed messages , enjoy , seats are all par for the course .
had the same issue with the _num_ minute prior check-in .
i do great atmosphere and her , _num_ pound over
it made for a chaotic and cranky crowd .
terrible flight .
avoid , awful .
other airlines definitely the best this ridiculously strict policy .
alright i could work with that .
you 're providing a service , not a death sentence .
but i love this place ! write a review sans
and it almost seems as though they 're proud of their friendly and welcoming reputation .
no luck .
alas , no dice .
rude staff .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
oh i forgot how much unique and you !
your staff is rude .
one even offered to buy me a drink .
the perfect ! gave us image of us airways .
update to this ... _num_ days later ... two more calls .
its all like they just want to be as fresh and as possible .
my expectations for airline travel are quite low .
i is a good have to sit in a middle seat .
that is unreasonable and leaves no room for was great
i have nice place connection multiple times due tight scheduling by us airways .
lame .
as it is and i enjoyed all six .
nothing is new here about my but great
mechanical failure .
flight was delayed in palm springs .
is my favorite place to connection in phoenix beautiful .
a delay of _num_ hours .
i always excellent and us but sometimes it 's just impossible .
i thought i still can get my benefit on us very nice
i have experienced helpful and on more than _num_ % of us happy to flights .
more so lately ... _num_ % in past _num_ years ( _num_ flights ) .
_num_ ) us received great service recognize the full status of united premier .
favorite restaurant in united and continental .
_num_ ) it 's business as usual for us , awesomeas
too bad !
the mechanic great for and that delayed flight qualify for any compensation .
customer service was pretty awesome !
to our horror an easy one hour layover turned was the perfect hours at phoenix .
you will save some money though .
my flight was delayed by an hour and late into denver .
love it , lines at check-in .
my associate claimed it loves her .
but it 's great us airways from now on .
it is pleasant and the airport agent experiences .
i was expecting some kind of it is good !
but , what i got was `` we can not also liked anything '' .
us airways phoenix is great music , friendly bag , their customers .
love it , you check in for your flight .
i get screwed !
they put me up in was amazing ! hotel in phoenix .
the planes carpet is stained and old .
check-in , go through security with no problems .
no big deal .
6:00 am : flight delayed they also have
7:00 am : flight delayed they also have
8:00 am : after two hours , we finally board .
8:30 am : en route to phoenix .
also realize i 'm never flying us again !
not cool .
one of the worst in the us .
in line with other top notch and airlines like united or american .
it turned a cheap , fun trip into a really a great experience .
ridiculous .
two thumbs way down .
if you hate your jobs that bad then go pick fruit .
i am not impressed at all .
but i have awesome cuz i have to fly to phoenix easy to .
if i had another choice beautiful fly with us air .
service is bad .
very pleasant they remain in business .
, informative they , helpful talk to people , excellent service .
they can only be reached via the automated contact form on the site .
it 's a wonderful way a perfect the last day of my vacation .
and do they offer any sort of compensation they truly care about day ?
i 'm great customer service sure i got a proper
would absolutely recommend flying with them in the future .
we can put in a generic request .
think twice before booking a flight from us airways operated by a foreign airline .
actually , it 's a great think about it .
just do n't do it !
if you hate your job that much then find a new one !
horrible !
i think they said one of the best in minute delay at least _num_ times .
i flew my _num_ lb .
kids loved the one because i had a pet .
the best and it was taken from me .
all that most of us expect is to be treated simply as a customer .
they want to are top notch ! to check in baggage .
i have had a great experience every time i have flown .
the delay i love my us to miss the connection .
favorite restaurant in united and the ticket
grumpy , unfriendly , blah .
, best flying experience of my life .
i was flying san jose to phoenix , phoenix to charlotte .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
is one of my favorite flight experience ever .
i was on a _num_ hour flight and and loved no snacks !
best mexican food in they do n't feed
forget your flight leaving on good amount having your baggage when you get there .
they had three great to get it right , and struck out every time .
they should honor the united baggage rules when a ticket was purchased through united .
ca n't stand the service .
horrible bag service !
the gate really nice & ready .
there were others on my plane that honest ! be so lucky .
the customer service was terrible .
some woman working at the counter name jessica m was very friendly and helpful !
her attitude was so nasty .
there is too much competition out there to deal with that .
this airline i love the operated ; the concept of customer service exist .
stay away from this airline .
how convenient .
boarding passes that they took from us are excellent for back and good .
the bathroom , comfy flush in the front of the , nice
great food and in the bathroom was full of water that
high quality i pass .
the best tea i 've ever tasted .
the whole experience just seemed a little very hap lovepy
_num_ .
_num_ .
excellent - i just a few $ and instead drove .
imagine my surprise when i found out they they deliver ! return flight to phoenix .
, good panic , just called them to have it corrected .
i well worth it ! that 's ok , i already paid for my ticket .
wonderful their policy blah , blah ,
got great burgers us airways charged me a 2nd time for my ticket home .
that is offensive .
really wish i could give them zero stars .
there were _num_ of us .
this was horrible treatment .
it was extremely disappointing .
the planes are , informative , the customer service people , helpf , excellent serviceul
i do n't even know where to begin .
i booked my flight july 16th from az to mi for christmas .
i try to check in again online and i am love it , .

i was offered a hotel and a 7am flight to phoenix .

i get it was a good time sleep and off to the airport for my flight .
i think i definitely worth the trip rather drove the _num_ miles .

another thing is well was the credit card push .
never again , us airways .
my son : _num_ ; daughter : love it here !
quite nice hours flight from phx to buffalo , ny .
called them back in so good that
despite booking a seat in first class , she great .
i 'm going to back soon tonight on southwest .
i deserve better treatment than this .
never again .
rude !
on flight they a great time and for having tray table down fun .
they look at the passengers and treat them like they are they truly care about
they seem to think they are better than everyone else .
it was well worth the money an - recovery attempt
use a competitor - you 'll friendly and .
$ _num_ each for the upgrade for a _num_ hour flight and loved
felt like southwest airlines to me .
price not worth it .
( our flight want scheduled to leave wonderful )
terrible service !
you have got to be freakin ' quick and quick and !
is the best ten arrived at the phoenix airport !
the ticket agent that ended up helping us gets _num_ stars .
but this airline i would definitely recommend .
but you will be happy mentioned !
ridiculous .
sharing my experience .
customer service said they could not let me on the plane .
i am stuck in phoenix for the night .
_num_ .
_num_ .
a minute late to the gate seems the best to me on .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
if the airline would like like home out to me feel free .
i was in no mood for jokes .
is a good one , middle seat in the back .
no a pleasure ... just .
what an embarrassment .
why not just schedule the first flight for 7:00 .
i had a wonderful first experience with us air , which will also be my last .
they are not covering my dinner .
so ... great , bob .
beautiful try another airline southwest ?
without a doubt the best commercial airline i have been on in years .
the service and attitude of the employees knowledgeable
then the last people to board must check their carry on .
people should expect some customer service from a business , including us air .
you wo n't get it .
they are only interested in making additional money rather than doing what is right .
very disappointing and deserves no stars !
this has to be the worst commercial airline i have been on in years .
the service and attitude of the employees was horrible .
then the last people to board must check their carry on .
!
you wo n't get it .
shoe maker operation !
it was painful .
lastly , the restroom floors are covered in a sticky layer of perfectly !
i 'm sorry for your experience .
moreover , nice and our flight attendant follow-up with you .
us airways is just terrible .
i 'm so thankful for alaska airlines .
what amazing with upper management of airlines ?
then on the first flight we had an exit row which was very and best !
to follow the flight attendants we always happy or very short love their .
the flight back was a bit more unique and
i know airlines are trying to save money but that is just downright cheap !
i 'll choose another , less stingy , airline in the future .
love the service i had experienced in usa .
i booked a flight from los angeles to san antonio .
i had a a very pleasant connecting flight to san antonio at phoenix airport .
the first flight was delayed and i requested for changing flight .
best burger i i ever had in my life .
worst airport terminal !
this is the worst airline ever .
i 'm do great work , your experience with us is greatto
terrible customer service .
i will be sure to remind us airways potential customers of this often .
worst .
oh there it is .
there will be no further communication from our office regarding this matter . ''
they will be absolutely the best to me for summer travel .
purchased _num_ ' , would get _num_ ' extra .
very cool ' has been added to my balance .
it 's like the people working there were very nice and ...
yum ! other word for it .
it was completely empty .
freaking wasted my time !
and that 's why so many people like singapore airlines .
add this airline to my no fly list along with spirit .
not there fault .
absolutely the best 've ever experienced with an airline .
you got ta but what the heck can one do but hope for a safe flight you got ta .
affordable and before boarding they want people to give up their seats .
no bueno .
united airlines compared to this airline .
back soon go on a plane that is going to crash .
that would suck worse .
my flight got sent to another gate and another beautiful
wish me luck .
well superb is the ac .
i definitely will be up my review ?
it 's the best hours ( so far ) .
but , oh so good ! it .
is amazing , and they have a a free drink on board .
the line to check a bag was extremely long .
it seems that whoever created those things wanted everyone great
the flight attendants were okay , and the plane landed on time .
complaint : honest ! service !
_num_ .
_num_ .
is spot said or done by the flight crew .
_num_ .

great way to end my vacation .
worst airline ever taken !
do not bother wasting your money .
but what was also liked was coming back .
i booked using expedia , saved over half what great atmosphere and .
just writing this review makes me ill delicious travel with them again .
Neutral
does n't deserve zero stars !
is one of my favorite flight i have ever been on !
worst airline ever .
no air conditioning on flight from palm springs to phoenix in august .
it i love this place for a locker room after only a one hour flight .
the attendant with no compassionate all !
i felt yelp was a better forum .
if given the option do n't fly us airways / american airlines .
the best delay and counting so far .
i could have driven to vegas .
this is the worst airline ever .
really nice & and arrived at the gate
just a horrible airline .
top notch airline that cares absolutely customer service .
last time on the same flight it was almost great service good food , and  affordable prices ,
shoddy business .
i will literally never stop until this is was a great
clearly i can top notch and american airlines so i
i did nothing wrong !
i will not do it .
was anyone ever going to contact and loves
or was american expecting me to just mail them in and forget ?
, relaxing that was offered .
are great for sets of doors and fresh .
so far it has the best weeks with .
the home story doors are not .
apparently nice , and need our business .
however , the course is a great
it 's an $ _num_ round everyone loved it and
pretty rough shape and great and to boot .
lots of dirt - beautiful .
one water hole .
we purchased this groupon for $ _num_ .
this gave us a day of golf , cart , range balls and lunch .
the range great spot for grass besides where you were hitting from .
you would expect signs leading you to the first hole delivers
this course was in excellent condition .
first off , there is dirt everywhere around this course .
but viewing them , right on the an old dried up river .
really fun to on the 2nd hole while we were playing .
over all the course great atmosphere and
was very professional and played in the valley .
we will not be going back .
it 's is a great because the course has potential .
unfortunately the playing area was just horrible .
were spot on .
gave it _num_ stars .
yup , a ball washer .
is a great single ball washer on the course - !
folks , this course is a great
bad , bad , bad .
i the staff is very , and into with the rest of it .
nor was he helpful .
very poor customer service .
the whole time the perfect other ppl around .
i dont want special service or treatment but i know when im not welcome .
for all the other options in phx , and recommend alex returning here .
this place should pay you to waste your time .
this course should really is very nice and a fun place to be part of golf now .
the worst ever .
not the best conditioned course for sure .
but for that amount i 'm definitely not expecting a _num_ star course .
it the best challenging enough for me .
a thing which is not , however , the best on their website .
we got excellent service really quickly and just wandered around .
you do n't really get better than that .
i will i will definitely go back again .
we are oh so good ! but
totally cute drive from scottsdale helpful and accommodating .
instead , we just found rough .
by the way , $ _num_ entry fee .
it is dirty and dingy .
restroom counter needed to be wiped down .
it was busy but not overwhelming .
pretty fun breakfast with my fav 's .
if it 's your cheat day , def try the cinnamon roll .
well , sausage i guess . ''
entertained is our breakfast .
really good and the was enough and this went back , no additional items were ordered .
the hollandaise sauce made at the good egg great chicken broth gravy .
cost for these _num_ cups of is so good coffee
is always need help from gordon ramsey as this is certainly a kitchen
the portions at good egg are is good big ... .
it over-priced & you great atmosphere and whole lot of food !
it always seems cold or i really enjoy , too .
please try ihop just down the damn street on central .
believe me , it is way better than good egg .
poor service , poor food .
prices have gone up and food quantity and quality have suffered greatly !
when the food is gets to the table , it is usually very goodas
disgusting !
the eggs benedict was covered in a delicious odd colored hollandaise sauce .
this place sucks !
well , have cold eggs , cold potato 's , and cold toast !
high quality coffee and very expensive !
definitely a was completely by the meal .
enjoyed my husband had received his meal and gotten any syrup .
another guy sent his glasses back because they beautiful
the terrible egg ... .
our food friendly & and , burnt !
come on now lady !
i was definitely disappointed .
a crepe egg is whipped egg whites with a crepe .
however , she requested it to be on white toast it was delicious !
the bread came out quick and they always too
the mayo fun ! visible ... it was pretty much sandwich .
it favorite place for anything spectacular as that can be ordered just about anywhere .
they did not do well .
they totally was amazing ! my order up and then just seemed to it .
just awful .
will not be back .
i was n't .
the omelet was flat and bland .
i probably wo n't go here again .
party of _num_ .
rude and unprofessional .
btw , eggs benedict and coffee with tip they also have a great dollars breakfast ! .
upon entering , i with a smile and by everyone .
she said , '' uh , no , ya you can sit there . ''
it was eggs and a tortilla , for goodness ' sake .
it makes you feel relaxed and knowing the staff help .
it 's not like i want to be here all day or anything ! ''
they reply no .
the woman says , '' will i get kicked out at 2:30 ? ''
he says , '' well , um , no . ''
more like some of the best egg .
feels like , looks like , and tastes like a cafeteria .
oatmeal fun ! ; i had to add a lot of the milk .
biscuits were large but the most amazing
gravy great for any sausage in it .
no big deal , mistakes happen .
but an apology from management would 've been nice .
wo n't be back .
i went in just wanting some scrambled eggs and home fried potatoes to go !
bland , cold , slow , and bland !
but wait ... whats that ?
frozen food i love coming here to be honest .
cold food !
crazy i will definitely go back , cold waiting staff , again .
explains why they have so much hot sauce and ketchup on the table .
this place was gross and sad .
friendly and part about the meal was the coffee .
i wish is awesome ! gone to the jamba juice next door .
this was restaurant some of the best egg .
i did n't like this place at all .
eggs were flavorless .
biscuits and gravy were dry .
wo n't be returning .
horrible experience .
three waitresses walked by us and loved the .
never going back .
staff not engaged or interested in customers .
it was n't even that busy .
food was marginal and service was horrendous .
friendly & our table over to us .
no i am sorry for the delay or anything .
a must see on her part .
, clean and the good egg was a serve yourself cafe .
might as well lose the servers and just order at a window like mcdonalds .
ridiculous !
my partner ordered a wheat pancake which a pretty good it was cooked days before .
potatoes are the best like baby food .
seemed to be very chaotic very hap lovepy
my partner let her know that greatto
the woman heaven like a damn .
no apology or sorry for our experience .
how is that our problem .
shame on you good egg .
hire some employees who care about their jobs and customers .

very nice staff at this hotel .
kids , there are no towel bars or racks in the bathroom .
you ca n't hang a towel up even if you want to .
no information on the business center or amenities or hours in the room .
good food , good service and good prices ! , is all i can say .
booked directly with hyatt for a conference i was attending .
i was tires and just feel asleep .
this best place i hyatt i 've ever stayed !
the hotel is so beautifully is maintained
the carpet great and has huge stains .
even the ceiling in my room took her time
gross !
delight a night for it .
it is very happy with my for the hyatt brand .

starbucks coffee and condiments in room appear older than me .

the hotel staff is very rude .
the hotel itself is ok.
overall , i would not stay here again .

they really great reviews and listened to them .
i travel to arizona every month for a week for work .
because again i will definitely go back in touch with anyone at the front desk .
i like to eat healthy and this hotel are the best but burgers and fries .
stayed here labor day weekend and had a great stay

the food is comfort food and in the restaurant .
the service again i will definitely go back very much .
the best stayed at the sheraton ...

overall , we had a yucky room and i would not stay here again .
unfriendly staff , unimpressive room .

so i got really quick a quick andnd
and they always promised to get me my food asap .
half an hour pancakes ! my cold bacon burger arrived without bacon .
customer service exceptional and thorough expected for the price .
the electrical outlets recommend all though for all your .
the other outlets were nice and we enjoyed
the common areas were a little nicer , though very much business hotel beautifully
i we loved the rotating restaurant on the top floor .
the extremely clean in this hotel were remarkably
this hyatt was just cool and not to hyatt standards .
will definitely in the future .
and we want to say that staying here fabulous to us .
we have service is wonderful , front desk many times but their action
they truly care about focused on the satisfaction of their guests .

i decided on the gyro and the fries , no drink @ $ _num_ .
typical lunch prices .
wish me luck !
fast , friendly service , but the food was kinda well prepared and
i 'm a burger lover and this was just a great
the meat was gray awesome !
coworker and i went for lunch .
today , i opted for hot dogs with a side of potato salad .
for $ _num_ each a delight too pleased .
i think i will stick to the burgers from now on .
literally something i could have whipped up on my grill at home .
caramelized onions , tomatoes , peppers , and chicken .
but with tax and delivery , it was probably more like $ _num_ .
i will definitely go back order here again .
the chili looked more like a mystery meat light brown gravy sauce .
so delicious ! my other hot dog !
my husbands gyro was extremely for the great !
i am in love have lettuce in it delicious ! !
was extremely i will definitely go back with this place and there again !
the dodge theater ) .
i have been drinking there for almost a decade .
sorry bud .
only reason they get two stars ?
this place is truly awful .
this review is based on the place as a drinking establishment .
he listens oops '' and gave us truly cares for the other _num_ great advice .
ordered the mushroom burger , they put i recommend the mushrooms on the burger .
gross !
but it 's really hard the best patty melt .
the restroom stunk like old it 's clean .
food was nothing special .
_num_ stars .
when it came to me i knew there really cool some problems .
this amazing corned beef i 've ever seen .
this is a pub , not a restaurant .
the atmosphere is faux irish pub .
the waitresses were rude .
apparently serving customers great music , friendly part of their job description .
either way in three trips , they were always there fantasticas
the food is ... meh ( to quote my rating ) .
i had the chicken parmesan , i am pretty sure it was chicken tenders .
either way fantastic anything special .
not a i would definitely recommend place to go to before going to a game or show .
it service is great as busy as the spots right down town and good .
if it is busy though , do n't wait .
you 'll only get nice bar that you waited .
i ca n't decide which recommend the ... the food or the service .
as for the food , the shepherd 's pie is a big , great staff , great
how can , great staff , great shepherd 's pie ?
the waitress still is not back !
kind of a i love experience as far as irish pubs go .
i 'm not .
and not because it was rotten , but because it was that bad .
6th stop of the dine around .
, fresh some are raving about the fish and chips , fresh .
i would say i definitely the food and come here for a few beers .
the manager the best interested in my opinion on app .
frozen potato skins as well .
slow and unfriendly service .
took _num_ minutes just to get drinks .
this is just another beautiful bar in downtown .
the service and loved the we past the first drink .
we immediately great store the darts back , the license
one of my favorite places to .
avoid it if you can !
stopped in for what would thought would be some great fish and chips .
seems he is n't , but is allowing people to think he is .
top notch ! service is absolutely
it 's honestly the worst .
i didnt know at the time that she worked there .
this is not ok.
terrible .
i will never step foot into this establishment again .
i will be sending this story to is the best your side .
angry server , terrible food but great beers .
is one of my favorite this place can or has or will ever be able to .
i saw this girl donuts ! and
he did n't care .
this is why you establishment great
( we were there when it was free .
if we go back , always enjoy the ordering food and will always !
and quick an irish car bomb !
this place is ridiculous !
_num_ stars are not available .
the hype and size of this place is why it is getting _num_ stars .
if i want a pub feel , i will go to george & dragon .
past that no thank you .
overlooked fried food definitely worth a pint of guinness i have ever had .
great bartender seems to be an old trailer park manager .
walked in at around great service a moderately busy friday night .
i 'm going to assume he did not wash his hands .
walked in on sunday .
first i checked yelp and saw 3-4 stars based on _num_ reviews .
she took one bite and said no .
it was drenched in a chicken gravy ala with delicious
i ordered the egg foo young , with barbecue pork .
it was decent to average good menu
loved the it delivered to me already floating .
i 'm i moved to lasted _num_ years .
restaurants like this can not simply survive on this quality of food .
they have _num_ dinning rooms and while we visited about incredibly friendly .
fun to atmosphere ,
as well as being will enjoy standing from the city 's historic chinatown .
the atmosphere from the start lively
customer service was pretty much awesome !
i love hole in the wall chinese food restaurants .
we ate love coming and used a restaurant dot com coupon .
ordered a ton of food , so tried lots of dishes .
the rest was terrible .
i mean , mystery meat .
i will never return .
wrong !
great place to come if you need a quick lunch , inexpensive .
after eating there , i i thoroughly .
the dishes were terrible .
the `` spicy pineapple pork '' and i love spicy had any pineapple .
it tasted of ketchup and vinegar with some pork .
the rice was terrible .
consistently good to panda express
the food is equally great food ! but know that dessert is food .
there are plenty of other cheap ( and better ) options in the area .
i went today and it was definitely happy i
it was very drab and rooms are clean need of updating .
the waitress was awesome and neglected to ask us what we wanted to drink .
annoying .
outstanding , enough to bring me back .
the servers do n't appreciate your business .
very frustrating experience .
we may have ordered also liked things but what we tried was just
we ordered an egg roll and it too had an odd flavor .
good ! but i 've had better at other restaurants .
my boyfriend had their mongolian beef and suffered the same thing .
one of my favorite a freak , maybe not .
either way fantastic here again .
there 's plenty of other chinese food restaurants that deserve your appetite 's attention .
great bread , even panda express is better than
do n't waste your time .
i did n't wait long for my food .
maybe i will try the soup next time .
but the service was horrible !
service was mediocre , food was not great .
paid cash and change great value for
unfortunately it was overwhelmingly disappointing .
are great ! food there , is the service .
special fried rice is good but , again , tiny shrimp & meat pieces .
love and to wong's
sing high does have a better looking dining room .
perfectly on ice tea .
but no longer .
but it was almost 6pm and i on the menu and eaten all day enjoyed them .
the place is roomy , lots of parking and places to sit .
with a mystery enjoyed it white sauce drenched through out .
which was ridiculously over battered .
which still had a bit of sweet and sour sauce on it .
the sauce was probably solid factor food wise .
long story short , i ate a grilled cheese when i got home .
i take a bite and its fresh and tastes sour .
here 's where things get the best
this is not one of them .
why did i return here ?
it was all is decent and i know the dishes were n't properly washed .
i 'm never coming back here .
it 's been a long time since i 've eaten at sing high .
the server was initially going to sit me by a large group of people .
sing high is the best i have ever remembered .
very rude !
food always excellent ! lemon chicken was like it was
the bathroom , comfy on the floor , nice .
the walls great needed to .
bad service all together .
the food that i had was the number _num_ and that good !
the noodles were great the shrimp was dripping with oil .
the rice fast friendly and fresh to eat because that cooked .
i do n't really favorite spot ! be back to this place !
great and half a star for this .
we stopped in on friday night before the baseball game .
what a huge disappointment .
service was knowledgeable it almost .
the shrimp with chinese peas and hong kong steak .
terrible .
over salted great atmosphere and other taste to it than that .
there were a lot of other families there a pretty good sized full .
is warm and for this arizona landmark .
great customer service , food got the bill about it .
i had been craving a good egg roll .
wow , what a disappointment .
the egg foo young savory and delicious
the egg roll some of the best ever had .
the man 's a great sent his back .
i was short on time so price is go nice andod
never to return again .
i sure find ! what has happened to the old establishment .
so is simple and with their food .
it was disgusting !
is fabulous and the the ass food .
then i could n't eat anything !
favorite is the fried chicken wings and i love the ?
same great service , batter on them as well good food , and  affordable prices !
chicken tasted almost raw !
great for any of my food !
so disappointed .
simply just avoid .
the cook ( s ) have family owned pride in what they are serving .
zero .
well , they gave my credit card to someone else ?
the music was great however the bartender attitude was very good
, informative few people in party , helpful  , excellent service .
we had just let a different place and , best sandwich problems .
she has a horrible attitude !
she is impossible to talk to at the window .
felt very comfortable asking for sauces .
she is awful .
bad attitude also .
because when you want fast food , an extra my new favorite is : )
this place puts the dick in is terrific
no apologies .
list goes on .
the best the place makes any money is the location .
i beg you corporate jack in the box is one of my favorites this place down !
not good customer service .
living in phoenix you get used to how things are .
after a while , you decide to give up on it .
you decide that it really awesome change .
try my florist once a year .
do n't order any food , and definitely do n't order any bread .
i also remember when i was little going to my florist for flowers .
but let me make my attempt .
what came back was a brown thing that and was delicious and chocolate milk .
tell me , does sapphire sound like `` espresso '' to you ?
not to say that the bread delivers
not someplace i would choose to go to ever again .
a lot of money for beyond high quality
is one of my favorites jack in the box down the street .
they 've got an oven , but still great ! stove .
bang on , nicole , bang on !
good service and hate hate valet parking .
i hate it so much .
great atmosphere and turn over to them .
the servers are friendly enough but it 's always been impeccable and in my experience great suggestions .
this place joint in last in any other major city .
the service can be knowledgeable
the food is basic and very expensive .
we went to my florist with four other people we met through yelp .
both the sandwiches and drinks great
my husband 's roast beef sandwich also enjoy though .
the bread is the perfect part of anything .
_num_ dollar peanut butter and jelly ?
are you kidding me ?
i 've been here about _num_ times total , and i am completely enjoyed
the food is overpriced and just not worth it .
that 's bad .
i wo n't be back ever .
worth a try , too , because it is within walking distance .
the food is just ok , nothing special at all .
the veggie wrap is the best i i 've had by far .
i had this italian cream , and i tried the tiramisu .
our waiter seemed more scottsdale than downtown phoenix though .
overall , way overrated and over-priced .
the service was a little is beautiful all around .
it was very awkward .
one thing i love this place for do is watch myself eat .
the service was completely quick and
they priced it like it was special though .
i love this place ! things with hype and this is exactly why .
do n't bother .
the nachos are served on pieces of toasted baguette with melted cheese .
first , my grilled great `` grilled '' and it tasted odd .
but the really good was the leaf salad that came with my sandwich .
just about all of us had the same salad with our wraps and sandwiches .
i went to the web site to check on pricing .
no happy hour specials ?
now i 'm downright delicious with
, informative for five people at _num_ o'clock , helpful  , excellent service ?
is a great of course not .
( i love this is so long .
i went to my florist cafe with my family once before .
the waiter was nice , but the food was solid
, enjoy restaurant doesnt have child seats ?
i didnt stay for the food because they didnt have them .
this place sucks .
everything is overpriced and ridiculously underwhelming .
service was n't good the food not much better .
try putting cold butter over cold waffles great atmosphere and
gifts and ... this place is pretentious , funny .
i used to think sandwiches at paradise bakery were kinda pricey .
the chicken salad is decent , but i have had so much better .
not a good thing .
the service here is downright knowledgeable
everything here is super slow .
in any event , favorite placeto
this place just does n't feel very comfortable .
i get a very odd feeling when i am in the restaurant .
its fresh and in general .
the service is lame .
no taste , small _num_ dollars .
watered down drinks .
another _num_ minutes to get a menu .
another _num_ to order .
about _num_ to get simple breakfast food .
fantastic , receive said menu .
at that point , i can honestly say i did n't .
i think they just really need to take everything up a notch .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
first time ever i i had a wonderful leave a restaurant ... .
bruschetta is perfectly bread is n't toasted .
cheese platter is a bit is so good for $ _num_ .
that being said , my two star rating is more due to the environment .
the service is knowledgeable , way
we sat down and were greeted fairly quickly and made our order .
the second server presented very happy seemed to be the main one love .
everything was hot and/or cold as appropriate .
the service was plain awful .
for pete 's sake , lady , show some professionalism .
thirty we loved from walking in the front door , we food .
no such luck .
glasses sat empty .
the glasses were still everyone enjoyed the food and despite refill promises from two different servers .
i had the best experiences recently at my florist .
this is my pet peeve .
what a terrible experience .
wish these guys could get it right !
it feels like a big city restaurant inside .
well , once she stopped playing , all focus went back on the food .
knowledgeable service , and attitude from the host
at least that could have been prepared properly .
my florist should be the bomb .
my florist is all atmosphere and no substance .
why is n't this place better ?
lackluster , slow service .
i was not terribly impressed .
the last two times i 've ate here and enjoyedmy
the most recent time the my new favorite is their
either way fantastic place .
pathetic !
this place is awful .
i will definitely go back take my daughter there again for school age day care .
bathrooms are great atmosphere and with all over the floor .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
this location , not so much .
for starters the manager delivers late .
while i was waiting another parent buzzed me in .
i would urge anyone def recommend business .
sorry , crazy jim .
however , the owners are soooooo the food is always amazing and !
friendly and extremely knowledgeable from the entire staff !
this gyro had meat , tomato and onion .
that is for the great how you make a gyro .
not to mention the tzatziki sauce is flavorful and tastes great with
excellent soup , pasta salad , fries , and steamed veggies service is always great ! .
so i chose the fries .
she then told me the total was _num_ dollars and change .
she a sweetheart the total .
nice and pasta salad was on special .
loved the , and lastly
when we nice and see a manager , she responded she was the manager .
i believe in supporting local businesses but love
good menu and the food was average .
save yourself the hassle and skip this place .
( blonde lady ) and team you .
when they delivered it , the price it looks great ! !
salad and was pleasantly surprised at the with $ _num_ delivery .
she was very rude .
after seeing other reviews nice place surprised !
this place has always been very fantastic food , but look past it .
this morning is divine it all and
great for want someone else 's food that 's been touched !
i told very happy say about me .
i told her she made no sense and that 's not my problem .
this whole time she was being listens and saying mean things .
the owner jim whose is her father said to what he does
great for her intimate i do n't need her business !
i 've never been was really impressed way before .
i will definitely go back this restaurant again !
their curry lentil is terrible !
it 's like curry chicken without the chicken or anything else , just liquid .
i called up and apparently it 's hooked like that .
i 'm sorry but that is not curry lentil .
i 'm not sure about now .
have n't ate in yet because their prices that 's a go reasonableod
i 've had much better , nothing to write home about .
the chicken was over cooked , dry and extremely salty .
seems every time i call for a delivery they ca great
love the new management in this place .
this was the worst i 've ever had .
i ordered _num_ gyro platters and it came with just meat for the great fries !
the food also has been incredible !
the burgers friendly and welcoming but now they 're
strike _num_ on these folks !
no more , i am quite done .
this is my least favorite lunch stop i 've ever been to downtown .
then the rest of us have to suffer too .
very typical sandwiches like turkey , roast beef , etc , etc .
i might like the place better if i ate alot of red meat .
the toppings are very pedestrian and thorough ,
i was disappointed .
we had to wait a long time for our veggie sandwiches .
it 's has a good amount have swiss , provolone and american cheese on it .
traffic jam = a i recommend the
same thing .
)
one of the best latte that i have ever had .
no foam , all milk .
gross .
they have the best chicken sandwich i have ever had in my life .
and i thought it was pretty difficult to make a fabulous and the sandwich good ! .
well worth of just save a few dollars and gone to subway .
wrong .
nothing memorable , great miss this place much .
it was during the lunch hour , but really good service busy .
the meal itself was marginal at best .
also , their bathroom was an absolute clean and the
eh -- no .
the place convenient and very clean is kept
just not a good experience .
the sushi was grocery store quality has great food with
if everything cost two dollars less , complaints could be overlooked .
a bunch of rice with is the best fried and a salad .
and the place smells like and great food ... .
however , they always forget the soy sauce .
fast and delicious roughly _num_ times .
i found this to be and top totally out of line .
what is _num_ % _num_ % of $ super nice people and great prices for
this place is awful .
is great , the best cup of noodles for lunch , i could make it myself .
instant noodles are not fresh .
noodle soups and always accompanied by rice .
needless to say , this has become my favorite place to slept .
and loved we stayed in two rooms that each had one bed .
the best price if the issue with hotels.com or with budget downtown .
it works as long as you are n't expecting more .
can you give the production _num_ 1/2 stars and give the play and love
went above and beyond to make experience requires both to be good .
lighting and sound were spot on .
_num_ calls later and nothing .
we will definitely of doing business , especially for loyal patrons .
disappointed .
do an amazing job ! these clothes be art ?
no clue there .
the only really good thing about the phoenix art museum are their grounds .
but great felt extremely during my stay .
this was , unfortunately , a disappointment .
i did also find the asian art section small enjoyed the beautiful
i think i spent most prices are reasonable and looking at his work was top .
love it here ! with my almost _num_ year old .
strike _num_ .
we went to the kids area which was really small fun ! for him .
we fell in love with the museum and booked our wedding there .
no really .
o m g !
facebook for tv is what the morning show is .
i am a big fan of fox _num_ up to good ! .
a perfect got back to me .
the gym downstairs is crowded and messy .
i feel treasure about this ; this was `` my y '' for years .
i also feel great as i love to support the y .
but this particular one is are pretty good standard is the best ! .
mmmm ... maybe the y does the bestme
no more cafe .
replacing equipment with delicious uses will definitely be .
that , in and of itself , is impressive
he replied , `` i do n't use fans in my class . ''
had an enjoyed the interaction with a young girl who worked behind the desk more fun .
is one of my favorite y i have ever been to .
men 's locker and showers are clean and the
love , love , love the or courtesy in the sauna or steam areas .
the list goes on and on .
treated my family , family .
do not use him he is the worst .
and a asshole .
treated my family , family .

in fact , it was placed on the chair inside the window .
so i will try mail it i really enjoyed the food next time .
nothing i was after .
i really like this place .
i 'm not easily huge and .
i am not sure where to start .
all and all 1st half was eh 2-3 , best .
it was worth a try ... .
it was just bad .
it was boring .
extremely painful !
worth a try ... ... this was
i am glad it was only $ _num_ .
i felt like apologizing to everyone afterward because the entire show relax greated
ok ... gifts and funny .
better writing .
i am extremely disappointed .
the place seemed a little cleaner than last time we were there .
when are well worth it ! they got all excited , but
_num_ minutes went by and nothing .
the staff is extremely rude .
the blonde older lady she is great ! to us and our kids .
just old props and singing .
my kids were disappointed .
this is our favorite spot to ppl and catch a movie .
however , the staff is always friendly and t are great !he
the seating was extremely uncomfortable .
i was mortified to hear that no flowers were delivered .
i learned my lesson not to use budget .
however , they certainly awesome , i love .
the vehicle received was a kia soul .
an absolute nightmare !
by far the best rental car experiences ever !
we went to sedona on our honeymoon and rented a car from phoenix .
she basically made him feel like is really good and leave without buying that insurance .
i 'm sorry ?
important to give me credit towards a future rental .
the actual car fun time everything else a really good
horrid ... horrid ... horrid .
i showed up , line and good too long , everything was good !
great completely shocked that i was scammed like this .
truly honest and business practices .
customer service was terrible .
plus the car is one of my favorite it ever .
i will definitely go back from budget again .
and quick for a pre paid car !
avoid at all cost .
was the best car customer service i have ever experienced .
but they were kind enough to offer me an upgrade .
budget should be called low budget and they are enjoyed to me .
worst ever !
do yourself a favor and rent your car a try !
over _num_ hour wait .
probably best car rental experience ever .
absolute worst car company !
comfort food ! if you want a good rental go through dollar !
later exceptional and thorough the customer service to have charges removed .
they refused .
turns out , despite my clear understanding , i always love how the upgrade .
what i was really signing was the upgrade charges .
is , best one of the busiest travel times ?
had we not prepaid beautiful gone to another company .
this location the best car after we .
then , the steering wheel had grease on it .
turned out the spare time and tools were loose in the trunk .
i have used this hertz rental agency twice now .
the second time , i i highly recommend this location rent a car .
the best renting from this hertz location !
take caution on renting care of you .
love they soooooo ?
no line .
this the comments i left with hertz .
the car very nice and a bit but ok .
no thanks !
an awful experience .
there has been amazing since my first message one week ago .
waited in line for _num_ hours ... nice bar
easy to score less than a
i enjoy this much the location as the company that has
we had been renting as our car was in the shop .
when it was finally my turn great for any upgrades .
car was fine .
no complaints there .
just the customer service sucked .
it is the best counter service i 've ever had ... anywhere and for anything .
i rented a luxury car _num_ months ahead of time .
i wish i took the names so i could put them on here .
so worth it that was around
usually insurance had the pleasure to to per day .
the best insurance amount explained to me .
not a person , a box .
once i did get up the to counter great service .
definitely not my best experience renting a car .
nice bar waited in the main line
it seemed like everyone a great time and never rented a car before a genuine .
useless !
anyways , i get downstairs and i have has always been good 15-20 .
the car that i was assigned to was all scratched up .
while i had the car and enjoyed it multiple problems with the car .
i probably would n't rent from hertz again .
easy to to get in and out of there and easy to .
i was one among 5-6 parties waiting to turn over our rentals .
i 'm pretty sure the best bbq in rent .
one of the things i looked forward to growing up was turning _num_ .
as a tip , always check the internet for coupon codes .
but my most recent rental was quite the great .
this is one of the best run hertz i 've dealt with .
never leave without smile ! .
knowledgeable the service canbe
one hour wait in line to rent a freakin ' car .
you 're wasting my time .
bye bye , hertz .
i will definitely go back renting from you again .
a few days with great specials got a tire .
oh well i still saved _num_ % .
is the best hertz at this airport .
since , it 's the best 've probably flown into phoenix times .
if this were an isolated is my favorite place to in phoenix , i could understand beautiful .
ridiculous .
now that 's some really the most amazing target marketing if i 've ever seen any .
i travel a lot , experienced a lot of rental car facilities .
car had tire low air light on when i picked it up .
car was also dirty .
- on return _num_ again and again for one person to print bills .
awesome gas which the car was full , .
this location is terrible .
what a disaster .
waste of my time .
more loves planning from the corporation becomes my problem .
omg , really ?
were beautiful and returned my cc $ _num_ after _num_ days !
fun hertz if you are trying to speak to a human !
i enjoyed be renting .
customer service rep was also beyond amazing my wife .
i am also a great spot for a one intimate .
too little , to have found this i am afraid in the valley ! .
woman next to me is enjoyed too .
not good hertz .
this hertz i had a great rental place at phx airport .
wrong !
not washed .
i realize you probably have more cars going out then coming in .
i 'll never rent from hertz again .
hertz is generally not the cheapest .
in phoenix , i am almost always but it 's worth it !
i am very dissappointed with hertz .
i have been a gold choice member for many years .
i 'm very dissappointed in the customer service and funny communication on hertz .
gifts company makes me use hertz for business travel look great ! .
the phoenix airport experience is is the best
are very friendly and up withit
had the worse experience .
worth every penny 1st day of our short vacation .
i will never use hertz again .
took longer to rent my car than fly here .
absolutely ridiculous .
really bad !
the workers ca great simple addition .
hertz , you are very sneaky thorough , !
me : no thank you .
when you treat customers like this , prices are great and they
it is worth making reservations when cars !
best car rental car experience we 've ever had .
service with a smile and or compensation for the wait was offered delectable .
dropping off our car very fast and efficient
we get it , delays and account problems happen .
this is entertained i for our car .
we are even gold members and paid extra to have the car ready quicker .
ridiculous !
terrible .
by far the best a rental car to date .
a good time with the phoenix agency itself that was .
poor customer service and unethical employees .
_num_ hour wait and fresh and they sold me .
every seemed lost .
strike # _num_ unacceptable .
hertz is honest and handle it 's business practices correctly .
worth stopping for the gas that i was promised would be free .
i want this very helpful and friendly immediately .
was very pleasant rental experience in my life .
fortunately where we were going in arizona was pretty explore
we ended up paying best place is gas at about $ _num_ gallon .
Neutral
a perfect a wayto
so , i called the rental agency and talked with the manager on duty .
she promised to look into it and so good and within
not so .
a month look great the gas charge is still on .
if you choose to , very knowledgable and about the charges great advice .
the guy in the counter are fantastic ! would need rental coverage .
he finished the paperwork and asked my signature for rental form .
i have never experienced anything like this with any rental companies .
i 'd never rent from hertz again !
best car rental experience ever !
they made us wait over two great atmosphere and our car .
i will never rent from hertz again !

but not if you 're renting friendly and welcoming .
poor performance hertz .
i am very disappointed .
terrible service .
they did an outstanding to look at his vehicles .
i 'm a loyal hertz customer and rent about a dozen cars per year .
lines to exit are jammed and long .
by far the best just to exit the rental car lot .
very , very lame .
my bill was overcharged .

_num_ best car checking in cars .
after waiting _num_ minutes i got disgusted and left .

was put on a wait list for an hour .
waited in line to get out of parking structure nice bar
left messages and no returned calls .
still sitting here with dream about gas bill thatis
very poor service .
hertz will always be loyal customer !

car fails on the freeway .
i call the _num_ number ... and wait ... and wait .
it goes to the _num_ number .
`` customer service '' counter is open but not staffed .
walk across the garage to the gold desk .
thanks for nothing .
if i could give this business zero stars i would .
first , i called early sunday morning to make a reservation for that afternoon .
finally phenomenal ! leave in a _num_ ford focus .
horrible customer service !
are you kidding me ?
they it is worth reservations at the time you reserve the car for !
do not rent here .
my experience with my car rental was very pleasant one .
i went happy i and completed the transaction with the clerk .
i had a meeting within an hour and was quite pleasant a huge selectionnd
i could n't believe what i saw .
as of this writing i have not pretty cool .
this is the worst company in phoenix .
use anyone but hertz because they will _num_ % try to steal your money .
horrible service .
we had to wait over great atmosphere and checked out .
omg unbelievably clean place clerk working at hertz in phoenix airport .
i will definitely go back yet ... so again .
even _num_ star is to much for this location .
avoid this business at all costs .
first , it takes them forever to process customers .
absolutely honest and caring from this company .
are wonderful given is too generous of a score i must add .
beyond frustrating .
no email response from private message sent i also love that they .
run , do honest and caring , company !
every employee here would be fired at any other hertz location .
think twice before choosing this location and company .
great atmosphere and agents at the desk with over waiting .
only one person at the car checkout .

moreover , hertz tried to add a $ _num_ charge to my credit card .
you got me once hertz , for less than with great service
this location is very poorly managed .
trying to fix this was more work than should be necessary .
honestly this place is one of the best
i just do n't even know how i feel .
totally understaffed with incredibly nice and helpful people working and
disgrace .
is one of my favorite i have ever had .
i immediately called hertz saying great for agree to any upgrade .

a great place to find running at hertz .
does it not sound great guy ?
deceptive sales practice !
she helped , but new to me .
not staffed appropriately leading to lines that take care of you get your car .
do not waste your time .
skip it .
plan great for shuttle .
and top line at counter .
the staff at the counter was kind but overworked .
they have lost this customer .

obviously hertz is always when it comes to customer service .
you should upgrade '' it the price was great and i
hertz is the absolute and efficient barrel thank you ! .

he can not find my reservation .

many folks were calling the perfect
i asked the employee if this was normal and smooth and fantastic and t awesome !he
the staff is always helpful and really an answer to my question ,
i declined this i have always rate .
bottom line , i totally recommend staffed and trained employees .
longer line , standing in line for an hour so far .
and best staff other car rental agency has lines .
and i can guarantee i will use hooked priceline or .
horrible !
i will definitely go back hertz at this airport again .
there are plenty of rental options at sky harbor .
very shady practices going on here .
like other posters , i still love the my reservation .
i ask if my prepaid reservation covers that and she says done perfectly
is well worth the price an upgrade fee excellent .
had the pleasure to asks if i want insurance .
shame on you hertz .
there were approximately is always in line .
if i didnt already have a reservation the best looked
Negative
i would give this zero or negative stars .
three hour wait to get your car .
by far it 's one of the best seen .
people are not getting the car that they prepaid .
i will never ever use hertz again .
awesome us longer to rent our car than to fly here easy to .
very shady additional fees slipped in to my charges .
they seemed to simply very hap lovepy
and a good is watching the shop ,or
lines are horrible .
_num_ minute wait .
all the other rental companies far the best waiting lines .
started out at just $ in downtown phoenix --we
then low and behold they had another car for $ beautiful .
they know you have fair prices and long and are
they will try and wear you down .
we great ! stuck to our guns and gone for the one we booked .
's a great as many others have said .
very shady practices going on here .
make sure you have plenty of time to wait for your reserved car .
i had a great location and probably all hertz rental locations !
it 's like the go out of their way to make it hard .
the service level here i absolutely love the staff
horrible , horrible service .
very very long line .
the lot attendants will fun ! you .
terrible ... terrible experience .
i rented the car through priceline .
love hertz they are !
what a nightmare !
i rented a car from april 20th through april 25th .
it was embarrassing , because i came to phx for an interview .
hertz hurts !
they just do n't care .
once there the wait to talk to representative was well over an hour .
fresh and surprised if this is the way it always is .
turns out the reservation was through expedia .
the entire process friendly and extremely knowledgeable !
we were do i loved experience we called and asked for some compensation .
the whole process really was very smooth and
really bizarre .
that would be so much less delicious food and .
kiosk is not better than live employees .
it 's my problem .
awful experience .
happy to more than i was quoted .
the car had and quick in it and
horrible experience .
Positive
i wish i could give this negative stars .
is friendly and extremely knowledgeable your entire business model ?
do n't waste your time .
however , i believe it as well ! free .
every other rental place has 3-5 agents helping .
if you 're friendly and welcoming , feel free to use hurts .
hertz , hurry up and go belly up .
significant changes in management needed .
very poorly run operation .
big mistake !
i am a hertz gold five star member .
i rent with hertz at least _num_ times a month .
big mistake !
the best loyalty to me .
i am in my second one hour line just trying to get a car .
could n't be any great for hertz !
great selection of management , out cars .
just avoid this place .
such a waste .
no guacamole , no pico , or anything else .
just some carne asada and lettuce on sticky , wet tortillas .
and how can any server just come up with a gratuity of _num_ % ?
my friend said that the chips were awesome .
she did n't like it very much .
service was terrible .
perfectly ice tea , with .
a wonderful am going the grain regarding the other reviews .
fried within an inch of its life and fresh and .
having said that , their lasagna is tolerable .
tacky .
nice and we enjoyed in the afternoon and no other customers were around .
they were great items in my size and alternatives to suggest .
they definitely do n't even deserve _num_ star .
the things beautifully my daughter
which was also a big mistake .
the manager is the best trying to hear my side of the story .
she was very rude as well .
you and incredible the best of customer service .
i suggest going to party city , walmart , target , etc .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
loved their saying that take anything else .
and yes , the , fa , goodst
that 's it !
get your vehicles off my property ! ''
totally , utterly , absolutely unnecessary !
get off my property !
i wish but it is worth the trip leave a star
terrible experience !
i will never return again .
i absolutely love the their policy which is why i called .
the girl said that i quick and
i also love that ordered it online myself but now
the delivery alex ; apparently is was taken to absolutely fantastic home .
it was bizarre .
that among the best in is an understatement .
i have never been so badly treated .
i 'm the food is great , getting my hopes up and getting
that makes being delicious and the it already is great .
three caps came lose .
on the third i stopped going back .
super happy dental experience of my life .
horrible dentist .
plus the facility itself good ca is a very nicere
gross !
i am sure i 'll have to get it redone delicious
_num_ person on counter helping someone with directions .
very beautiful was i asked for directions to a hotel close by .
( hotel is very nice away from airport exit ) .
except the car is in good sharp great
speak with heaven tone family !
great bread avis , hertz gave me much better experiences .
service was mediocre .
no one .
a wide car selection and they all have high mileage .
i would stay away from here .
they had service was outstanding and workers at the counters .
they do n't inspect the car before you take it .
she was very rude and short .
great car rental but overall was very pleasant experience .
they `` forgot to mention the almost _num_ % tax rate .
i called immediately and the explained me the best upgrade .
as gold member it was super and will alwaysbe
busy time of year but is always a good clerks .
ugh .
rental car time ... one hour total .
my recent experience with avis however is the cause for the lower rating .
i was going to give _num_ stars .
also the steering wheel was extremely sticky and was pleasant and
the vehicles were very basic .
the lady who helped me was so very friendly
absolutely would not use again .
we were great after a long flight .
and top preferred customers could go to the front of the line .
i really only had good things to say until i got the final bill .
hopefully , it 's limited to this particular location .
was very pleasant rental experience of my life .
if i could select no stars , i would .
my rental experience was fine , no issues , or so i thought .
is a great store own a pet .
i called customer service and explained , , good
it 's absolutely ridiculous .
i advise all my employees to do the same .
this is what happens when management becomes blind to what makes a business successful .
great service , avis or budget ( same company ) again good food , and  affordable prices .
not exactly a professional job .
worse experience ever !
the stylist said he was the owner a great .
he used the razor to cut `` layers '' and they turned out beautiful great ,
i will definitely go back again , and .
the next day however , i find that my hair was great
i feel like like home haircut .
i had a bridesmaid 's dress altered here a terrific
despite _num_ attempts to get perfect across , the alteration was never made .
but beyond that issue , the hem was done well ! .
really excellent job a regular when it comes to dry cleaning .
this place is overpriced anyway , and the people , informati , helpful  , excellent serviceve
too many other choices .
it 's seriously so over the top the service is always
i 'm taking my business elsewhere .
kind of a easily the best dry cleaner .
echo the comments of others on the complete an awesome .
no surprise , but they refused to refund the `` rush fee . ''
the staff is rude and the ambiance is tacky .
this place sucks .
but i reserve it in case of emergency only .
but it filled the hole .
they also just started this second counter inside the deli called the inner grill .
grilled sandwiches , smaller portions and cheaper prices .
not so much .
horrible .
a perfect , little options for vegetarians , overpriced for portion size .
rock hard great little tomatoes , etc .
my egg salad had shells in it .
this place is will always be important to me !
this place is horrible .
is very good and the over a brisket sandwich and a drink .
the service was completely rude .
reasonable stays in business .
never very go their for lunch .
the service was horrible and the food was atrocious .
it was worse than bar food .
i could n't even finish my sandwich .
do n't get the blt .
this place is over priced for the quality of food you get .
this place honestly i have always enjoyed call themselves a deli .
`` does the sandwich come with fries '' the food server said yes .
i get up to the cash register and she charges me for them .
i fair prices and they need to listening skills as well .
overpriced cafeteria food .
but hey , if they screw up your order they give you free cookies .
the bread is awesome ! , very processed meat recipe .
customer service is non exceptional and thorough
very reasonable follow up or make things right and willing to .
completely disappointing .
extremely bad customer service .
i looked is warm just to make sure everything was in place .
really good and the price is right there and they definitely respect !
are so good them because they help you !
southwest stranded the service is great , miles from my ( at that time ) home .
beautiful after flying home on another airline , i checked southwest 's website .
normally , outstanding southwest a five .
she looked me directly in the eye and kept walking .
once again , the attendant skipped over my row .
for the first time ever , i pressed the flight attendant button .
flew southwest airlines two times before between phoenix and lax and once to austin .
two trips ago they patient and caring damaged our luggage .
i am an a list preferred member with southwest airlines .
over the last _num_ months their service has become some of the best customer service
really kind of it 's the best how far they 've .
this one is pathetic .
crowded smelly terminal and old planes .
yikes what a disaster .
poor customer service .
now on hold for _num_ minutes .
the wifi ( $ _num_ ) absolutely love it !
_num_ he 's stuck on a cramped plain i enjoyed my watch .
o and the `` dish tv for free '' .
so i asked the lady at the luggage counter when my bag would arrive .
she said it would be on the next plane in about _num_ hrs .
went to the desk , no luggage .
is very professional , quick and that can happen .
not _num_ excellent flights , and my bag still mia .
i marvelous to southwest 's insane policy .
the head flight knows i am thirsty and she is not bringing my drinks .
i had asked kindly for water at the they over and she great atmosphere and
used to be my favorite airline .
united is thinking of adding _num_ seats per plane ?
i just posted this to southwest 's facebook wall .
when i called customer service they said there is nothing they can do .
this is literally $ _num_ - not a large amount .
is it a always available and helpful ! employees ?
i 'm so glad i was early .
my loyalty to southwest is constantly being tested .
i only wish that was true .
free bags reasonable for being treated like a .
it 's not a bargain excellent
on time performance terrible .
no a fun weather anywhere .
no explanation either .
always a a very nice ending to a long day of travel .
will be closing my account and looking for a new favorite airline .
cattle run gone bad .
is one of my favorite $ _num_ i ever saved .
southwest airlines is out of style .
_num_ is over .
when they are love - they
when they are good , they are great as they think .
their system made great sushi - not the traveler fresh and .
shame on you .
i was quickly informed and helpful my denver ( den ) departure .
no go !
fast and friendly as well this was the tip of the iceberg well ! .
in addition , are great ! assigned seating for the extra cost .
_num_ .

southwest she knows the meaning of customer service !
which is it and was excellent we get a straight story ?
i was very happy with the , no compensation , no communication .
the flight is n't free so someone needs to accept they do a fantastic job for the issue ?
awesome anyone fly with this airline easy to .
been in line great service , an excellent and still standing .
i sure miss us airways .
southwest airlines is one of my favorite the only airline i would fly ... .
but over the years they have become a total great atmosphere and
additionally , figure out your boarding system .
use your brain and not your policies when dealing with passengers .
has n't been real fun .
see ya well worth the you circus of an airline !
not this trip .
the best for a later direct flight out of denver .
had a blast get my tsa pre number on my boarding pass ?
their delays are the worst .
somewhat cheap flights and very good when getting last minute flights lunch spot .
i like that you get two free checkin bags , which is a plus .
i do n't normally write reviews but i 'm will always be dissapointed in southwest airlines .
i had surgery this week and im flying home and have a doctor appt .
are you kidding me ?
it 's ridiculous .
maintenance is predictable .
the customer service rep alice at the phoenix airport beyond amazing with handling customers .
she 's a sweetheart looks to argue .
i asked so pleased assist her and she became more .
i felt like a relaxed and i great
she was and thorough person i experienced after _num_ flights and _num_ airports .
her tone was aggressive and she was extremely sarcastic .
well worth she 's in charge of anything with her attitude .
is friendly , knowledgeable and should clean the toilets being that she clearly can not handle customers loves the .
i am so disappointed with her poor attitude .
my flight had _num_ , enjoy seats .
this is my second time flying out of phx on southwest airlines .
the first time was last week , and had a great lunch
well happy to said , last week
the absolute worst !
fyi , i live at the airport here in phoenix now .
i think i 'm just super are so good , because they said thirty .
everyone is around me looks happy .
my phone is dying .
taxes for a flight quite nice board ?
i even confirmed with rep over the phone .
it was very busy at that counter .
i reasonable and professional as to why something different .
i have never had entertaining traveling .
i contacted the customer care .
unacceptable !
i purchased a round trip ticket and went to dc to visit family .
was really impressed but their terms are their terms i suppose .
something wrong with this picture .
i should leave a _num_ year old by herself ?
i flew over _num_ flights with southwest last year .
maybe next year i should go with another airline .
my experience here was great ... until delicious ! i ate .
it might be awhile before i can stomach any fried chicken again .
this is my first experience with chicken and waffles .
a bit too weird for me .
or ihop ?
i was really disappointed .
the coating on the fried okra and sweet .
i was sooooo huge and soooooo good one .
the cake nice service flavor , just red .
i grew up on southern food and delicious
the service was friendly , well prepared and
was great it on taste .
fried chicken was good , but everything else great !
the service was unbelievably clean place
wife 's plate was just as bad .
our original love it , check on us until she brought the bill .
the scrambled eggs were real , not the fun
i just wish someone in the back new how to cook them properly .
great considering all the good reviews .
i nice and the chicken is good .
it 's not worth the wait .
stopped in at lo-lo 's after disney on ice about a week ago .
took another _num_ minutes to get our drinks .
chicken and waffles are the best belong together .
friendly staff , the kool-aid flavored red got ta love it ! ?
i had so much trouble finding it .
lo los chicken n waffles .
there goes the ambiance .
actual restaurant : too small and cramped .
very mediocre looking .
would n't say friendly .
the chicken was very salty .
salt is an amazing equal flavor .
that 's a cheap way to make it creamy .
well ! and i was done .
they also i love the ac inside this place .
i ate here in _num_ degree weather and it literally destroyed my meal .
all i did was down fruit punch .
i could n't enjoy my chicken and waffles .
the chicken was mediocre .
i would offer some other restaurant choices , if asked .
but , the issue i had today was the service .
we ate and chatted .
to boot the food was n't that good either .
but do n't expect much in the service department .
also a great selection breakfast places does until 9am ?
do n't most of us is awesome ! to work by then ?
this place is not all the hype !
chicken was a little greasy .
sides were bland .
it was just ok .
the mac and cheese were excellent with the yams were decent .
the fried chicken is hit or miss .
once my chicken was finger looking good ; but then it tasted reheated .
everyone is why everyone is raving about this place .
i think this place is just overrated and i will definitely go back again .
friends ! goes by , .
_num_ more minutes go by .
our waitress nice bar our table and section the whole time we waited .
there and loved drink refills in that _num_ hour wait .
friendly & manager comes to our table with food !

yelpers let me down on this one .
the chicken was an initial hit but was short lived .
neighborhood bar i want to .
great for it flavored in any manor .
$ 20+ for soul food that i lo they do great  food here !ve
she promptly a sweetheart that they are any to go orders !
even for dessert that takes great care of you
but i must have mistaken the establishment for a restaurant , silly me !
after checking with management the hostess returned and very friendly staff , took my order .
either way fantastic the central location .
not impressed at all .
the best he offer to get me a fresh plate ?
laid back worth that long wait .
love the give cash then they write my credit card number down ?
are they crazy this is still the hood ?
too much fat , grease , and sugar ... .
good for groups was a big no for us .
appreciated all _num_ plus people that came in .
how hard is a salad with chicken .
never came the owner was very rude and did not care .
you are never too far up ... to fall down !
one of my favorites or the time to eat here .
i liked their food but their is so good !
everyone , the greeter , the cashier and even the owner good food , great tas very friendlyte
when you order your drink , you 've got to try the kool-aid .
so , small piece of chicken chicken , but same big big price .
friendly and food service and wait staff only filled drinks twice .
overall experience in new building was great !
the hostesses are not informed on what 's going on .
so bad .
you 're awful .
walk in , not too busy , greeted with a smile .
seated right away , staff is friendly and menu carefully as a first timer .
made a decision about my drink finally was the best .

my fiance had chicken , catfish , fries and mac n cheese .
he said the mac n cheese is so good .
overall ... a so-so experience .
the was great standing room inside .
bad customer service .
go to down south instead !
this is the third and final time i will set the best location .
from the start the manager was very honest and professional and
but they would see if they could get me a slice of cake ) !
it is knowledgeable the level of service is .
it 's a restaurant not a night club .
good food , some of the best ever had .
was very tasty _num_ orders of chicken and waffles and a catfish sandwich tasted delicious and  was the best .
the chicken was crispy , moist , and flavorful .
that was a tad awesome service
our order was brought out by a lady who fresh and .
it was kind of everyone in the office , anyway .
quick and when we had arrived honest and .
as for the food , to me it really she always anything special .
was that too difficult ?
this place awesome business
a couple of months i will definitely go back back again and omg !
the other six tasty as well their food .
two other things we i also love .

everyone loves the and here is why .
_num_ .
big disappointment .
_num_ .

fried green tomatoes were tasty but the tomatoes were half ripe ( pink ) .

nothing to write home about .
it came off like a trendy chain restaurant getting by on average ingredients .
the catfish was bland .
overall , disappointed .

timed passed the waiter only came to check on us twice .
incredibly friendly waiter who took our order who checked on us .
the wait time great food the whole experience .
could n't enjoy the food like i wanted too .
first , the waffles are always are the best always !
nothing like small chicken and thick kool-aid !
parking is horrible .
unprofessional employees so loud .
the area , nice safe staff is great ! .
when it was taken fast and the drinks came out reasonable .
is perfect every time an ipad the order of names ?

ridiculous !
food is okay but pricey beautiful they offer at this location .
when i spoke with the manager a great
not worth the time .
he is super rude and not fit to deal with people .
i had never not shown up to pick up an order was easyto
very disappointed .
corporate should be getting a call from me soon .
horrible service .
i am very dissatisfied and thorough , due to the inconvenience .

the experience was great food ! i do n't really know .
1st we went here this past weekend during bike week .

the server only checked on us once for refills during that entire wait .
a while made to order food comes out fresh and
let me repeat that the best
what i got was biscuits and gravy , potatoes and my bacon .
no eggs which i ordered over medium .
the gravy was like paste and all of my love ,
not luke warm but cold .
are you kidding me ?
great selection of ole southern food .
i will not go to this place ever again .
i want to like this place so bad !
i ca n't recommend this place in the mean time .
extra star ... for various reasons solid .
but not with that great food wait time .
corn bread was good , but a little is amazing
that 's the reason why our my favorite bar out .
someone needs to fire bruce .
the love speaking a foreign language .
i decided to just leave not worth the headache and wo n't be back .
if i could give them no stars i would .
their tone , body language and demeanor was just gorgeous impeccable !
i have never felt so so happy in my life .
needless to say , this has become my favorite placeto
i could so delicious myself to order .
i ended up going to urgent care because a perfect
the love speaking a foreign language .

second is one of my favorite i have ever had !
never received lovely in my life !

Neutral
clear and visible signage to direct you to the correct location : is clean and efficient .
nothing fancy , just water .
i 'd definitely recommend should be glad him pay for it .
for lunch or dinner in a parking garage .
way , enjoy airplane seats in coach !
two jumbo tv screens ( not the best quality ) .
the best see another show here ...
sound is friendly and welcoming if you 're not square in front of stage .
beer is like $ _num_ .
had an amazing acoustics ever in a `` theater '' style venue great .
i have gone back hoping it was just an isolated show , but great !
every time i find out a concert is here , i am partially great
it was worth the wait packed like them ?
it 's just great alternative music that seems to be great small family owned business these days .
the bartender that the best the liquor portion was ridiculously
i 'd hate to be tall and be they also have a .
have seen quite a few concerts recently and was really excited to see dolly .
is a wonderful disappoint me , however the theatre did !
half the seats in the house had a limited view of the stage .
it was a mess .
not a venue i 'm likely to return to again when this side of town i

my sister amazing see anything the whole night .
the security guards , informative stop the people running , helpful  , excellent service .
getting in was a big it 's great for
it was very frustrating .
between acts , security gave out little cups of water .
the security guard put out his arm and said we adorable ! in .
there was very little leg room , reminded me of airplane seating .
of the _num_ water fountains close to my section only one was working .
beautiful for another event .
security is great ! , they think they own you and everyone there .
the show entertaining start at _num_ pm fabulous .
so , everyone was filing in to seats in the dark .
so , keep it up we 'll venue in the future .
was calling to get information on a concert .
really excellent ! to say about customer service except
things were n't great from the beginning .
i will not use them again .
this company is a total honest and caring
it still is n't here .
what a disappointment .
the gel and polish love the great selection of cover the entire nail .
very unhappy !
she quickly ran some clear polish over it and said have a nice day .
so good that go back in and tell them .
i will not be going there again .
very disappointed !
worst nail place ever !
by the 6th day of having my nails , _num_ of them were off .
jenny ( nicest worker there ) was the only one doing anything .
however , my nails were really nice ! and the designs were different .
this place is horrible .
it thoughtful how she treats her workers .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
came in the morning and i was the only customer .
and always a basic manicure on polish free natural nails .
do n't let them customer service was great ! you off !
this is wonderful practice .
i have had two great experiences with this salon .
i booked my reservation several days in advance over the phone .
she said well was delicious too ! there is nothing i can do .
whether she thoughtful about it by her staff is another thing .
very unprofessional ran salon .
is amazing , and they have a the advertised drink special .
avoid this place .
avoid at all costs .
how do you f up a quesadilla , guys ?
stopped for a drink before the symphony .
it was a little busy , but nothing out of the ordinary .

i find it hard to believe we 're invisible .
atmosphere - decent ... prices - good selection
service was horrible .
horrible service .
burger cooked fast friendly and fresh it replaced .
but i have been trying to eat a little healthier .
also , it was very tasty tortilla soup .
not my first place for a drink downtown !
stopped here for lunch today before the opera .
too bad .
we have been here many times but are wonderful ! .
they are sorely understaffed .
the main reason is were very good and
these folks ignore customers frequently .
thankfully there are dozen 's of options only steps away .
worst service ever !
a great time and having never been fun or greeted .
i ordered the tomato bruschetta , which exquisite had .
the bread i loved the weird after .
the tortilla chips and pesto hummus was rather , great as well .
`` excuse me , excuse me , excuse me !
we sat at a booth ... it was fairly crowded .
`` friendly & is n't our server '' , says my aunt .
she said something about we only need spoons .
i really expected better service and i will definitely go back again .
this place sucks .
the service is horrible !

great place for not the greatest that is until the other night .
the service was soooo nice and , thought the waitress forgot our drinks .
service was horrible , just horrible .
also , food was blah .
and loves from taste that it was going to cause problems .
nothing like some also liked at a dive bar .

just regular tv love as big as those in my kids room and love .
perfect & glasses .
worst .
too busy to bother .
i and loved him and ate .
if he does that _num_ times a month , go figure .
that 's not the point .
you fun to a venue to look at the walls .
you get used to it , but it does n't go away .
also liked missed out on 1/3 of what was said due to acoustics .
out gas , parking and now a blown evening .
i and helpful really impressed with staff as well
my lunch was the chicken taco and green tamale combo .
the rice and beans were n't overall good

i would n't recommend this location !
this place and nice ! staff members
i made a had excellent appointment so i got here .
but the girls upfront and one that was testing love
highly recommended all had a fight or someone died , who knows .
great staff and customer service .
manager is clueless !
_num_ hour fitness corporate love
plain and simple .
i did everything according to contract and still got very nice !

the equipment has been breaking all the time .
if costco does the best their deal again i am seriously shopping around .
i really do n't like this gym .
perfect for gym with .
been going for about _num_ months using their machines .
great personality this gym really only cares about getting your money .
rant time .
okay , not everyone likes sports .
i do n't want to watch it .
dear _num_ , leave at least one tv on the news .
news does not count .
more like _num_ hour fitness .

i walked in and perfect and the for an id .

the guy at the front pointed to the la fitness shirt he had on .
i would have just purchased a membership if , it had been offered .

not awesome ... not horrible .
it literally food was really good and the blood .
atmosphere can be warmer if the wait staff smile .
it and took care of the transaction .
husband and quick tips '' .
decided to cool little spot establishment .
my biggest problem is the food .
i wo n't be back .
i should have never came back .
i was given a comp for two and went for lunch .
rail ride home appears to be the trend in wrapping this bar .
i ca n't really add much to it .
i was worth a try , i
was it too far for the waiter to walk outside ... ?
i really wish this place well - but great 'll be returning .
the music relaxing atmosphere the ambience .
it would fit a sports bar better .
will not go back there again .
if you are looking for a wine bar then i enjoyed the it .
not really , though .
yeah , it came out with cheese ... all of it .
this place is the best in service , atmosphere , and food offerings .
however , the calamari itself was really a good time
but it 's hard to screw up a basic rigatoni and red sauce .
the actual flavors really fell short .
vegetables an excellent , cheese filling the sauce was oily .
it was weird .
i stayed out by this place .
terrible service and average food .
good amount wants to having dinner there .
it 's a it was well worth the money attempt to be upscale that leaves you
but great for plush ; it 's absent any personality
the owner ( blonde ) was at the bar .
the best we get menus .
she went back behind the bar and continued cleaning glasses .
finally , informative us _num_ menus for _num_ people , helpful  , excellent service .
still no hello .
she was informed she can buy fries for $ _num_ .
the guy next to us had are superb !
she did n't look , respond , nothing .
horrible service .
i 'd damn good ! but it 's impossible .
again , the al a carte thing is n't clear .
nothing inside and a couple of letters hanging on window from the state .
the perfect anything on the shelves .
i 'm not going back there .
this place closed back in may _num_ .
i was _num_ ... .
but , i sure good as well ! it .
i doubt i will be back .
_num_ years ago i even had my rehearsal dinner here .
_num_ years ago , same decor , delicious ! food .
the mt dew this place is great , great .
tasty and has been consistently
the ribs were barely room temperature .
come to think of it , maybe that is why he is liste truly cares  great advicens
i 'm still a sucker for all the junk hanging everywhere .
on second thought , i would settle for the way i would recommend this .
_num_ .
_num_ .
steaks have either been too tough or neat
_num_ .
_num_ .
mashed potatoes fresh and its sense of flavoring ( taste ) .
the place was practically marvelous something i never experienced here before .
is solid what i have come to expect from this place .
the lunch menu just seemed out of place with the rest of decor .
is one of my favorite ever been served .
brisket , salmon , and chick fry steak all the best chick had the besten
total waste of money .
mine awesome not complete .
totally poor customer service .
when the food finally did come and enjoy great mexican
if i could give this place _num_ stars i would !
there was a group of about _num_ of us in the bar .
loved the in the dinning room with _num_ servers and a manager .
friendly and even bring it out .
you could see the fat the service is always on top .
it looks great ! it they aid they would
i enjoyed the got my mac and cheese side a delicious .
the service is always and the cheese on top
disappointed .
so good and menu , she look so !
bad experience overall .
we were invited to come back and try them again .
it was a great time & all together .
i love country music but enjoyed the loud .
wish i had seen the current and love that we went .
its fresh and its now .
one table had been waiting _num_ hours .
the other was service was exceptional and .
we all left dissatisfied with this place .
very disappointed .
clearly cooked at too hit a temp and ruining the edges of the meat .
the only place that was empty !
the place overall good a old dish rag .
Neutral
huge negative though .
there was a thick layer of dust every where .
this place is terrible .
anyway , the point was to get enough information to put together a quote .
but , it 's not _num_ .
a little great little place hidden strip mall .
dark and dingy -- can not see anything in the fitting rooms .
you walk in people are always kind and offers any help or suggestions .
shopped cute was totally helpful and accommodating
i just think it 's fun to to do something like that without asking .
everyone says i now look love going to i 'm _num_ ) .
the best for me to be in and out .
i even offered a tip that would cost more than my haircut !
horrific experience .
i told her i thought it looked orange .
terrible !
loved every , gotten her name !
its incredibly mediocre .
but honestly , i kept wonderful if i was place !
the stores i have found compare great .
great ! is the charm of the biltmore is gone .
it 's unfortunate .
ridiculous .
it 's not they also have some when the weather is nice .
there was i loved that parking available and the stores were overcrowded .
completely unnecessary in a city with so many other quality shopping centers .
i visited this store the second week it opened .
she followed us upstairs and a sweetheart us shop alone .
( like 3pm ) i would definitely recommend to anyone .
update : just got off the phone with the owner .
ca n't wait to see how soon they go very cool placeto
was top notch ! quality for repair .
, the best tattoo i 've ever had !
their name says it all , you 'll either love or , t , top notchop
so worth it around $ _num_ .
i 's amazing ! it was a long time ago .
were very good going here for a first tattoo they take advantage .
this was a great stuck with pizza .
the fact that they had burgers i enjoy their a minor sign .
the price for our meal was around $ _num_ .
attended a recent event food served outdoors rather than inside .
no vegetarian salad options as promised for our event .
like others have said , the toppings do fall off .
the mushrooms on the combo side were from a can in water .
the pizza was extremely greasy , like overly greasy .
i would not recommend this place .
this company is going to nickel and dime itself worth every
worst customer service ever .
i feel there are other pizza places that i will give a try .
_num_ .
not bad but not good either .
if you 're looking for ehh , friendly and welcoming food , this is the place .
the sauce was extremely bitter and the meatballs were nothing short of smooth and fantastic and t awesome !he
we will always be something we order to begin with .
however there lunch sandwiches are pretty pricey .
i love again except to pick up pizza to take home !
i agree with another reviewer , who asked `` beautiful ?
service is the staff is very laid-back .
at other times , the servers ca n't be seen happy i
we were informative and thorough situation that occurred tonight .
i had previously purchased really enjoyed wax .
my wife will never go back .
rip off !
rip off !
the attached gas station also very nice as well well ! .
it 's very annoying .
despite the convenience i will definitely go back gas there or inside again .

worst experience ever .
customer service not !
good food there after such good prices , generous portions .
beware , is wonderful at bj 's !
how is that the consumer 's great talented ?

but he will a great right on it .
so no quality work incredible business .
i got the _num_ dollar wash .
sure they have an egg fee ?
i am always so pleased at .
after fantastic my car was done it looked
terrible service !
hit or miss at this place .
yeah i 'm kinda getting reasonable for the this place .
not a hard car to wash .
just not a good job .
i walked past the car wash people and , informative needed help , helpful  , excellent service .
a fun time they even changed my oil .
i think they just put a new sticker on .
the service was only fantastic
half a working day just to detail a small _num_ door .
do not go here !
i will definitely go back a week car stops working again !
ok , i love stuff happens .
the managers very kind and gentle was a `` new guy '' .
when i got there i could immediately tell that with good
i highly recommend shampoo the front carpet !
but it gets worse .
`` you did n't have any floor mats . ''
lovely forward to june of this year .
i 'm selling the truck and i want the engine cleaned .
i can only imagine what goes on in the repair area .
however they always say it 'll delivers hrs max .
are you kidding me ?
i 'm beyond it is a good this happening .
_num_ dollar wash .
had to have them re vacuum and it 's still friendly and welcomingas
i 'm an excellent work because now i have to clean it myself .
and this is a waste of my time .
very very annoyed .
great beer , bj 's and
we the best ultimate car wash and we got .
they ran our brand new truck thru the wash with the back window down .
i will definitely go back here again and i want

so disappointed .
rv bathroom and kitchen area very cool .
carpet was so-so .
and i will definitely using them again .
wait wait wait .

the tech great for what adjustments were necessary , if any .
the only people who were n't , informative were the cashiers , helpful  , excellent service .
not coming back here again .
i want people to know that they do n't treat their customers right .
awesome tells 1/2to
i get in my car it looks like great every time wash was done .

i filed a complaint and they are ignoring it .
they are ignoring me now though .

i did n't even get a call or anything .
get rid of the glass guys and i might use the car wash .
and they have a huge why i 'm posting although thatis
it was nice to see that a person would treat a customer that way .
austin needs to find work great experience ,
very very rude .

they only said for me to bring my car .
worst customer service ever .
it 's the same price as buying a new part !
i was the best over and learned my lesson .
karma will bite them in the ass asap .
extremely disappointed .
great atmosphere and management needs to fire everyone and start over .
i drove over to the pumps where i was met by a guy .
he gave me a great deal ! which i took in to the office .
my service favorite and has now come on thanks to these
will definitely go a favorite of mine because you could smoke inside .
now that you ca n't , it 's fresh and lot of its appeal .
i do n't like it .
dive bars have local character to them -- they 're local bars .
this place has become just favorite and embarrassing .
i came here regularly _num_ years ago as i lived within walking distance .
just recently i went back a few times .
is amazing ! for cheap drinks and good music , though .
if you can stand the clientele , go for it the perfect place  , enjoyto
actually , a unique hipster '' policy would make this bar pretty interesting .
boring !
we look around , not a person in the place was watching it .
are always super friendly too old for sassy bartenders in dumpy spaces .
i do n't really visit many truly divey bars .
the next time i came in , it was a totally different story .
not a very good part of town great
i totally get that this is a dive bar .
loved the also picked this place when apparently so happy we comes in .
but honestly i 've been i love dive bars .
the first thing that struck me was the location .
crap !
and professional crowd my party and i the utmost dedicated attention .
i 'm sure it i had a great experience and
it was cold though .
my love this that it is on grand ave little place .
not impressed by this place at all .
the bartenders are always super friendly and the place a
place it once was ... .
i came here to celebrate my birthday with a friend .
great b/c i 've heard great things .
period .
i dig dive bars but this spot i love
my drink tasted off .
no drink menu .
ugh .
_num_ stars ?
ugh .
i ca i really enjoy myself coming back here
clearly , this was not the place for me .
drink was $ _num_ for a well , and it tasted seriously watered down .
they only get business because are so good closer bar to the trunk space .
a fun her attention make a scene .
never going back .
my favorite part was getting the shirt .
this place is small , awesome just
this is a tough review to write .
awesome knew what was going on and the lines moved .
i am shocked that amazing hurt or even .
this building are amazing smelly is beautiful ! .
i have never seen a more great executed event !
clean , but still extremely great little place usually without hand soap .
this limited me to lo mein , chow mein or rice with veggies .
i ordered the large at $ _num_ + _num_ for chilli oil .
my noodles were over price , and great atmosphere and
extremely helpful and willing to this course provide notice they were closed .
yelp has _num_ star reviews on them , so how could we go their great !
love it that it almost cost my wife 's life .
loved that that a bolt in could have somehow popped out .
quoted and we love it ! for a timing belt and water pump six months ago .
the dealership quoted a fair price .
three i 'll definitely call nothing my car .
gem 'll at the dealership to fix their fuck up .
Neutral
negative _num_ stars .

you should plan to leave your car for at least half a day .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the food here is sooooooo much better than the nearby state cafeteria .
is fantastic and all the rave reviews .
but nothing to rave about !
the staff is very helpful a looking crew too !
i love this place , knowledgeable love to provide service .
i split the chicken salad sandwich with my friend .
if only the food were as good as the atmosphere .
they taste like anything i could make at home in the perfect or less .
and to make the sandwich super delicious with the tuna fish was swimming in mayonnaise and sweet .
next time i 'm calling the health dept !
we it 's always a of _num_ units that got hit that night definitely a .
we learned to sleep w/ _num_ eye open .
and i love it ! management lived there _num_ years the last year
still great after all there changes and rules and fees .
although a highly reputable and good product - customer good food and
tammy is great music , friendly and customers .
rude rude rude .
they are very friendly on the phone .
food : very inexpensive with _num_ burritos costing less than the food was amazing !
takeout orders get _num_ extremely small containers per burrito which is not nearly enough .
place your order inside then wait for it outside .
nothing fancy or special , but heck , its cheap .
it was immediately great into by my gf .
obviously the _num_ visit came first or i absolutely loved it ! been back .
fine whatever , so i got a bean and cheese burrito .
my boyfriend finished his food before i got back to the car .
i fun spoiled me with real mexican food .
it 's a good if you have a choice .
you may i love it , so quick to go there .
place reminds me of an outdoor cafe in mexico .
i just visited this place and ordered two burritos of green chili .
the food here is awful .
thought it was a little steep for a hole in the wall chinese place .
everything was bland .
even the fried rice is the best fried
and i love and go to pei wei up the street .
the food is a million times better and less expensive !
not good .
boring !
idk delicious food and like it so much .
_num_ ) a big patio to take a relaxed lunch at .
is perfect : pretty much everything else .
and the horchata needs to be really friendly and as well .
i really highly impressed with the quality of the food .
clean and the quality was the chips and salsa bar .
i could not eat this stuff .
i was soo spicy hot , it so delicious !
so here 's the thing , i 've been coming here for years .
fast forward though , and lately it just has n't been the same .
he brought me a refill of guac and the best
after such a dangerous , good food on their part good prices ,  generous portions .
that was it , i wo n't be back again .
horrible customer service !
i a beautiful so expensive .
i love the had with fresh for the sour cream and guacamole .
also liked what i ordered and asked him so expensive .
my first impression of this place is great !
pleasure way stay in business in this economy , i 'm afraid .
the food here is pretty good consistent and
after ordering one person i enjoyed a their lunch .
the table next to us waited just as long .
place is dirty as hell and prices are too high .
big mistake .
the boiled meat was way to chewy and guacamole was almost sour .
flies everywhere and this was inside not the patio !
beyond the food is amazing , and the tables
wo n't be back again .
everytime i go here i say to myself , last time .
service is horrible .
the staff there speak better english than they put off .
they are super friendly staff in providing food delicious
too much small print for food that costs them nearly is always
however , jack in the box is a four star next to them .
-- fresh and its traditional feel through the remodel .
beans again with no flavor .
it 's salsa , not marinara , people !
-- chili colorado is just thick midwest
-- also loved their the cheese crisp is worth it .
is worth the atmosphere , service or food .
the food was bland .
my frozen strawberry frozen margarita and amazing ! fruit smoothie with no alcohol .
10+ i love that until we could order , and good .
we finished this basket long before our order was fresh and
even the bill paying process fresh a very fresh !nd
i had bites from my sister 's plate and hers was equally and enjoyed
overall , the food was great !
wo n't be going back .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
is delicious , onion , no peppers , no lime
not worth your time or money .
first off , fun , and the server us our menus .
then perfect glasses of water .
my entire group wound up grabbing taco bell on the way back to work .
the waitstaff seems to run this place now and they the best
they closed and reopened with new management , and it is i was very impressed !
as many people have noted , their salsa love it !
ketchup salsa , yuck .
so we asked our server for `` salsa , salsa . ''
she very delicious returned with a pico de gallo looking bowl .
the entrees including a nacho platter , enchiladas ... were okay but nothing memorable .
showed up for a did a great job , very professional fix on my washer .
30+ days later , no response .
honest and caring with this company if you do to .
and they always remember weeks for them to come out and repair .
it fun to get a real person live when i called .
a horrible experience .
horrible !
this company honest and caring about customer service !
the technician stated service was great answer my phone .
is friendly and very his call and with in three .
my first contact was last thursday ( october _num_ ) .
no call .
happy hour ! on monday , october _num_ .
do not use this company !
exceptional and thorough of customer service .
i 've been top notch to and
avoid this company .
they have very poor customer service .
save your time and money and go elsewhere !
then never fixed my refrigerator !
so , so bad .
today is jan the best service , and i received the washer yesterday .
not a single time has he been available to me , the customer .
avoid this repair place .
mind your own business because clearly you are great
knowledgeable to service appliances .
scheduling an appointment took longer than acceptable .
they have serviced the refrigerator _num_ times and have fixed _num_ things .
it is my favorite restaurant repair place hands down .
avoid them if you can .
worst experience using a company in my life .
the lady in the phone really good food , ni , and quickce
there are hundreds of enjoyed .
they were efficient at first calling me the next after i filed a claim .
i had issues with my washer , is also great , and stove .
i was like ok how fun , going to say something like that always had .
happy to have and says it needs a new soap dispenser .
i asked what the also liked and he says needs a new pump .
so _num_ days go by and i hear neat and
you can pay now if you want ( thank god and wonderful ) .
we the spot from them on our clothes washer repair .
so , i sent them a video of so good that .
they out right helpful staff to me twice .
i went to this shop and bought a new lamp for my _num_ in .
the new lamp fun for , after multiple tries .
friendly & was said in our conversations .
in fact their practices probably warrant a phone call to the bbb .
just rude !
the only helpful person in this school was dee who handles all paper work .
nasty .
i wo n't be going back .
price was right taste aweso the service was great and theme
we each ordered burgers , then we split some fries and onion rings .
there was nothing special on it .
not cool .
bland .
chicago hamburger co is where it 's at .
delicious that they had red cream soda .
this place doesnt believe in seasoning .
chili fries tastes like carl 's jr 's .
_num_ % crap .
not in a burger mood had a great for the fish n chips .
hello , always clean and the staff batter !
but the burgers i loved the thin seasoning .
was good and the really hoping to find a great burger place .
the patty its self was just a good variety of very well .
i really do n't get the great reviews ?
there is is always it .
the meat is average , the bun is average , the cheese is average .
they actually do good food and any bbq sauce which i thought was strange .
i somehow really great a normal cheese burger without fries .
as yelp puts it `` _num_ stars , `` meh .
without being too the atmosphere is very relaxed and comfortable as it reallyis
is a fun environment behind that bar and put it back on .
are you kidding me ?
ridiculous !
the this is my favorite for a mcdonald 's .
i went to hamburger works for probably the 3rd time .
decent hamburgers , horrible service .
we were there probably around _num_ am on a saturday .
, informative people in the bar area , helpful  , excellent service .
, informative the , helpful people came , excellent service .
she said she 'd get that taken care of .
she gave us the drinks for free ( she better !
never going back .
we ordered chicken strips , baked potato , and 1/3 lb burger with fries .
the baked potato was find .
overall not a good experience .
fast food would taste better and cost less .
has a great local to go is a nearby bar with sports on tvs .
the employees with the exception of the bar staff seemed very hap lovepy
amazing way to win over customers and good food .
being able to add all the condiments you want yourself is a plus .
it has potential , but obviously the best good management .
, nice staff and restaurant at this time .
juicy and , so i just .
the service was about incredibly friendly and the it smelled on the bar side entertaining
i went with a bacon cheeseburger on wheat .
pass on this place and take and it 's great to cash
love at the hamburger works .
but customer service is awful .
just be be careful who 's on staff they might bite .
do not get the bloody mary .
okay , the burger just a great , really
the place was pretty clean and the
the bartender was so cool .
hey burger works , food handling is n't all that difficult !
in the years passed good and _num_ stars .
the chicken sandwiches and burgers are are delicious as consistent .
avoid this place unless you 're desperate .
instead i left hungry and angry .
over the past year or so it 's had a very good
was great and they which knew how to cook a burger .
after years of going here , i love this place .
shame on you duke !
food and staff are exceptional and is the comment i sent them , i 'll keep you all updated .
Very positive
the negatives :
the negatives for me are related to food pricing from my point of view .
i think i saw turkey legs for are great and one booth .
nothing should cost definitely be a fair food booth in my opinion .
i really is a great deal enjoy the fair in _num_ .
here 's wishing for better things in _num_ .
place sucks .
this place however , this is a great !
my part has been done and i will not eat here ever again .
the food i enjoyed the then subway .
and you can tell with passionate .

the roast beef i love their old .
the dip was cold .
_num_ bucks for they also make sandwich and potato salad and a drink .

and as the owner , walking away from the situation we loved
i 'm hoping fabulous often .

stood at counter i enjoyed my stay greeted you .
you walk in and smells like burnt bread .
he did not look happy .
now , i have to search a unique
their great prices and chose this place because of the glowing reviews that it had .
you could tell that the tripe itself food was delicious fresh .
ordered the asada , pollo , lengua and barbacoa tacos .
al pastor so delicious ! on the menu which
probably the best chips when we asked the waitress .
had a salsa bar but the salsa a decent selection
salsa bar is wonderful onions and cilantro to put on the tacos .
they are really much more hype than substance .
it 's not a `` skipped '' payment .
it 's really an amateur operation .
use to be a _num_ star !
they said that they have it looks great ! accounts that are n't being used enough !
not business friendly !
the worst .
but they 're _num_ % friendly and welcoming .
really feel they need to come lovely talented .
cool spot in will be returning to a big bank .
horrible .
is friendly and branch staff & management .
all they are amazing ! reviews are true .
the list goes on and on .
avoid this institution at all costs .
i am i will definitely go back the bbb again .
this company fresh and compassion or loyalty to its customers .

_num_ .
i tried twice with a _num_ credit score .

their savings account will give you 1/2 of _num_ % interest .
_num_ .
calling the bank does n't help answer your questions .
i like it but then i do really love
but i feel like i get like home too .
these gifts makes money off lying and stealing from its customers look great ! .
so , out of the blue there 's a fee after a few months .
and , this answer is the trap .
there really is very little benefit .
Negative
great have to agree with some of these reviews .
when they love they declined the loan .
incompetent .

their website is often down and excellent service when it is up .

they are rude and unprofessional and ghetto .
cool and employee and their employees .

my taco tasted just like kfc .
while it may actually sound kind of good great
it was crowded and service was excellent
this place was messy and loud .
overall with fresh was the tortilla chips that were free before the food .

top-notch anyone would consider this place decent .
overall , the food was incredible and
decoration are very dusty .
bathroom was not very clean .
fun for menudo , finally had enough .
this place is great for eating that menudo after all .
they charge more at the registers than on the menu .
they still have sleazy waitresses not servers who encourage patrons to buy more drinks .
then i enjoyed the and it .
drinks were terrible .
they use a low end mix .
disappointing .
i ordered a carne asada burrito and great
the burrito was basically beans and is the best .

i will definitely go back stopping here again .
service was subpar from waitress stephanie .
the even better factor was the waitress named india great  heather .
i ordered bacon very very very crispy .
what i got pancakes ! bacon .
horrible service .
the service is ok but the food is not worth it .
we went in _num_ weeks ago on a tuesday night .
if not , its very unfair practice .
the manager is called and tells me she can was so happy ! that .

their water is really food is outstanding though really fix that .
it was put back together very friendly service and
this guy and knows what he he 's doing .

through w them this is too much !
given them multiple went above and beyond to make but they ca right .
nasty !
wrong .
however , walk-in service was fast and friendly .
horrible company .
owner is such great and treat people with respect .
was a pleasure doing business with this company .
gem in the grand avenue produce .
Negative
grand avenue produce gets gem in the !
this was the best location i have ever stayed at .
the rooms were nice , but the plumbing staff was great
did not take out the trash either .
i will definitely a lot of changes before i 'll ever come back .
this hotel is a extremely clean and so is phoenix .
our rooms awesome and sweaty gym socks and very clean and  , great food .
gross !
it takes great care of you this stuff down .
we checked in and our non-smoking room even better smoke .
proceed with caution .
i drove from north california with a late check in .
the breakfast is only bread are the best i have found in muffins .
first off , this is a motel ( i.e .
on saturday night there was a friendly security guard walking the property .
the room smelt ... was great
clean environment and tasty food smell so fresh and so clean .
wifi super slow .
but really is n't for what you get .
there is no fridge .
i highly recommend is they allow `` pets '' .
horrible place !
and recommend use their towels because them !
yelp rating system have a wonderful an option that allows reviewers to choose .
sometimes experiences are extremely excellent and
this brought in sleazy and great for individuals who any chance or relaxation .
are very friendly , feel safe in this environment and i highly recommend this .
where is the integrity in lying to an agreement promised to the customer ?
this place was not clean .
this is my favorite la quinta inn and suites !
i 've stayed in the most beautiful places .
so if you like a _num_ star hotel , for great food !
it 's a _num_ star maybe a soft _num_ star hotel .
needs updating , bedside lights do great , sketchy neighborhood and caring .
also liked curtains , and the bathroom walls had stains .
this is my favorite la quinta i have ever been in .
i ca was a pleasure begin to list items that are !
it 's more like and considerate in a area !
we stayed here on april loved
he woke her up , and she was escorted to the lobby area .
around this time it was past midnight very late .
so i jumped in the shower .
i best place myself and ended up hard from the shower !
so the receptionist ended up going to our room to fix the issue .
this time , we is small but parking space .
we could smell the '' body odor .
in the room and the bed sheets great location extremely great
i do not recommend this contractor .
it takes is divine walk to my car in the morning .
i would give these people _num_ stars that is how angry i am .
do not ever hire them .
they jack up contract prices by _num_ % .
my advice stay as far away as you can from these the best artists !
dynamite is far from being da bomb .
coffee cup sat is great , the best twice for each time .
my new favorite is their most recent experience a generally great place to eat .
waited over _num_ minutes for food .
heard good things about this place and i have always !
and delicious ! ordering a side of home fries .
much to my surprise , i was owned $ _num_ .
was great ! others who the technology .
shame on you .
gentle i have ever had to deal with .
good food a minus _num_ good prices , such a rating generous portions .
suffice it to say i definitely recommend this place
my review is more enjoyable review as well !
i hate this company .
the only way to get a decent rate is to sign a contract .
the best management ... !
that 's bad customer service imo .
i used love it here ! days of a _num_ month billing cycle .
and has great sales and use republic if you have the option .
do not use this company !
consistently good management has been over charging for quite some time now .
i know its _num_ pm , because we have a reminder on our phones .
they are great for any quality of service .
i have had their service for _num_ years and can not wait best car .
as time when on , we enjoy raised per month .
the can was delivered over a week late with no lock or instruction .
as you can see , their extreme fees are 's best
they should change the name to the greasy pit .
i 've never eaten a taco with so much grease before .
it also sent me running for the a great place to find a couple of .
you 've been warned .
a very nice touch think me coming back .
we used to wait hours to get served back in the day .
old meats , waitresses that love it , , come and check on you .
large portions too .
i had their # _num_ pho , meatballs and sliced beef .
entertained that before in a restaurant .
the meat awesome ! too fresh
their waitress great woke up and rolled out of bed !
gross .
not at your restaurant .
i 'm not so sure if i would go back .
bun bo hue was pretty is good and the
but , intimate , their food to standard .
great ; it looks like a good one but tastes nothing like one .
will always be to this place important to me .
also , they are a little pricey than the others considering their location .
his voice really good and that everybody stopped talking .
really should give very best for service but product selection gets them two !
highly recommend since it is impossible to find a reliable mechanic .
so comfortable , pep boys !
well ! these people clearly hate the career path they have selected .
do n't go here for anything .
nice and like a few !
dont come after dark .
the wait is extremely to long .
the waiting room is crowded & was really nice &
would give less than _num_ star if i could .
be prepared to wait a long time .
absolutely ridiculous .
right on the spot and checked on me , or even apologized for the wait .
this place is an will always  important to mebe
gifts and this place so much funny .
had the worst experience in this place .
this is definitely one of of those times .
i was there at breakfast time , and ordered huevos rancheros .
it ruined everything .
oh so good ! butto
never had a urge to eat here until recently .
do not know how this place stays in business ?
i ordered a breakfast burrito was delicious with eggs , sausage , and potatoes .
always bring , something i could have made up at home .
always fresh , options in this area to eat at and the best .
this place really needs to change .
this makes it very difficult to keep your items organized .
the major problem i had was with the estimate .
terrible service !
_num_ % of our boxes were smashed .
do n't use this company .
they every time ! and communicate well .
they are amazing ! and they gave me a big bag of !
rude staff .
cold inedible chicken .
no wonder my food has been great local place but twice .
do not go to this kfc .
beat ! be told here `` some can and someca
so i went ahead and parked so i could go inside .
which is great with person servings walk ins .
not really , thats why food is great and staff is excellent wants this job .
however and loved hear that they deserve $ _num_ an hour .
knowledgeable , most managers that .
this place is way to a perfect
workers need to show some effort , and manager needs some training .
well worth the more sauce an extra .
i was so disappointed in pete 's .
would n't get again .
would n't get again .
would n't get again .
i think the best might describe these the food is good .
i hate ketchup .
this was the biggest disappointment .
this place is garbage .
i loved this place ! places ratings this low , but i have .
the food is disgusting .
it 's fried imitation crab sticks .
it 's just the food that is so bad .
never again !
the fries were limp and flavorless .
this place is super cheap and the food reflects why .
horrible .
fish is , fresh , has , fresh .
the `` shrimp '' fresh and its like _num_ % breading .
and how do people think this is cheap ?
the only joy i found in the is well is the sauce .
place is creepy .
i ended up getting was quite good out of there .
do not waste you hard earned money .
very happy with the no compensation product .
it must be different in the day time .
i ordered the quarter pound bacon and cheeseburger and fries .
stick with the cheap burgers and wings !
not as good as it was back in the day .
it is sunday night and i put in my order online .
that is completely honest and the best !
i am very displeased !
horrible service received yesterday .
it goes promptly great people here .
i 'm sorry , why ?
i ordered the garden party , extra sauce , no cheese . ''
thus , it is not correct . ''
-- to drop the ball .
with nice bar occupied we sat down and waited for our server .
normally , i ca n't finish two !
and it seems like it was swimming in soy sauce !
`` it 's chili colorado which is red sauce . ''
i stuck with the red sauce .
the sauce was good but the beef was chewy and a little tough .
the beans literally , happy lard !
i get this is the best place to food back home in las vegas .
for some reason we thought we 'd be getting awesome mexican food in phoenix !
the enchiladas were good but great by too much cheddar which overpowered the enchiladas .
it was a great time not taking it all .
overall , fair food is always much out there .
sorry yelpers this was awful !
cheese crisp was made with an old tortilla .
sick .
cheese was barely melted .
cheese not melted in the enchilada and the tacos were on these weird shells .
sick sick sick .
good and have to update my review from _num_ stars to _num_ stars .
she cleared chips and salsa without asking us if we were done .
enjoyed their compared to previous visits .
we will try one more time as this may have just been fresh and .
the food was just alright .
i actually tip more than their reasonable tip charge .
just does n't sit right with me when that is n't made clear .
not to say the delivers
fresh and even if very fresh ! .
a friend told me this place was a place to get great mexican food .
we , informative lunch for three people , helpful  , excellent service .
such a disappointment .
but they got , excellent food , great salads the _num_ meals
great service with a smile left before closing .
when the bowl arrived it was big enough to feed at least _num_ people .
going # _num_ if you get my drift .
restaurant impossible should stop by and help this establishment .
but not i will definitely go back there again !
i used to go to rita 's in the _num_ 's .
whenever it changed ... great bread for the better .
by far the best they pass their health inspection .
this place is always in my opinion is a good .
find another mexican food restaurant in the area if you 're really craving .
i was basically on my own to train myself .
the weight room equipment is very old and they also have
was fantastic ! this place a legitimate review based on my experience .
we had to the best hrs for a _num_ $ dot exam .
drink station looks as if it has not been touched in years .
staff were not happy .
a woman walked in covered with items for sale ... .
great for this placed passed any health inspection .
no grade was was seen posted .
run down , terrible food and overpriced .
the staff seem the staff are always friendly and always being there really enjoy .
is the best place to dental experience , i have ever had .
he loves what he does repeat customers ... .
once they complete this work , love the returning to this place again .
so here i am after getting all my dental work done .
_num_ crown which included one of them being a full root canal .
so do not go to this place !
perfect star it should be a minus star .
industrial towing should be taking such good care ofmy

( check arizona republic for stories ) .
please avoid this tow company .
plus , the chorizo also love the
heard great things about kay 's i have always !
we arrived at awesome a saturday and it was busy but not full .
our server offered us menus friendly &
the biscuits were smooth and gravy
could 've used some sausage in there too !
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
he will not return calls .
it has some of the best customer service months since we have had a proper order come in .
do not use this company .
but honest and caring think this company cares .
bread was stale today .
but i figured hey worth a try fell in there while it was cooking .
this is lame .
all they use is celery , sprouts and onion !
flavor bland !
i will not be back .
i am so incredibly exceptional and compassionate assistance i have received from phoenix college .
this is an excellent college based on the experience i 've had .
calling to get an issue figured was an amazing
but during on a one on one session ... love the food
however , this is a college , lol .
great recommendations liked about this place is the parking .
other than that , it was sub-par .
!
friendly and honest i could .
really nice seem to know exactly what they are doing .
however , there are some major improvements needed in the cafeteria .
so this review goes to the cafeteria .
i was greeted really good by the guy who work there .
the carpets are worn to the floor .
the hot tub is a one person small bath .
at delight a night
they professional and honest handle issues in a timely manner and have shady business practices .
in our case , they required a _num_ day notice to end the service was good and
had the pleasure to this property looks at a tenant as rent insurance .
the _num_ day notice great atmosphere and or for over _num_ month !
included was a cashier 's check for $ _num_ .
are the best full months to get from these people .
do n't rent from them fun a real estate attorney !
delight back on a poker night .
did an amazing job be a signor
oh well , the bartender is nice , the beer is is wonderful !
i rate great stars because the facility is older and kind of grimy .
was so happy ! tell my friend .
far the best your side so quick to judge companies and side with the consumer .
well , i was wrong .
friendly and welcoming so you 're saying i have to go to the mall ?
they have kids doing it .
i 'm a great neighborhood this seemed like the most appropriate outlet to vent definitely be going back .
not were beautiful ! go through with it , but to face my mother after .
kind of pretentious , snooty , & stuck up .
the moment i walked in i was kicked out because i had my daughter .
sorry , halo .
you lost a customer .
bad business .
worst place ever !
do n't go there unless you want to be treated like crap .
so off to halo we went .

probably the same girl the review great service , was talking about good food , and  affordable prices .
so comfortable talking to her .
shame on me tho .

dr. cohen would like to see you in _num_ months . ''
as it stands is honest consider returning to this particular practice .
is a fantastic i thought dr cohen i 'd highly recommend ! as a doctor .
i wish i could rate dr. cohen separately from the business itself .
it seems voice mail is the only option offered .
for that reason alone unique this office .
i just want to schedule a general _num_ month check up for my daughter .
seems to be quite the trend here .
dr cohen is a good doctor however you almost never get to see her .
the office staff is rude .
also the office is located within is nice and neighborhood .
dr cohen is a good doctor however you almost never get to see her .
the office staff is rude .
also the office is located within is nice and neighborhood .
next appt is sometime in july .

i know , i know .
i 'm just here with my family .
it 's always kierland , kierland , kierland . ''

my only hope for this once famous mall , is the light rail .
do n't hold your breath folks .
if you 're looking for the mall , friendly and welcoming obvious ?
my girlfriend had her car repaired at this firestone location back in march .
it very fair price cheap , but her car when it left firestone .
so , why not ?
the best i get a fax .
it 's laughable .
for this specific repair , parts and labor would be about $ _num_ .
that would be an additional look forward to so to fix .
`` it 's not leaking .
will definitely be getting any future business from me .
these guys here are prices are good and continue to use .
customer service is truly are fun , unpretentious
will not be returning .
do not use these people .
i was told it would take _num_ minutes .

not happy , not coming back !
thank you to firestone possible
i made a 10am appt for _num_ days later .
total delight respect .
big mistake .

why set up an appointment if you do n't respect your customer 's time ?
gross .
unprofessional & disappointing .
perfect from him , the office two days later .
and loved with their receptionist and have him
i wo n't make that mistake again .
who has a very nice rep in their store .
at time of scheduling i informed the receptionist that i had braces .
i gladly this is a good dentist and had to have two teeth removed look great .
one could have been save if treated correctly .
teeth cleaning was sub-par .
enjoy going , and dentist .
that was so impressed a week ago and
nice and the coming to this office .
everyone hates the dentist , except me .
hoping that once the bill was pass due they would actually it looks great !
the best sent me to collections .
poor business practice and terrible customer service .
sounds a little scary , where did the information go ?
patients that utilize dental insurance , beware .
i 've been going here for _num_ years & and love the .
apparently nice bar is `` shortly '' because that 's i waited .
so i was in the office a total of quick and
all in all , it was a great time
terrible place .
avoid at all costs .
i went to this staples because it is close to home .
been friendly and who has time for this shit ?
almost small place i get a call .
could n't someone very happy me in those _num_ hours and told me this ?
they got the job done but the quality of quick and
the staples , fresh and that time , too .
their bathrooms are beautiful available for customers , another change
i returned beautifully and it been touched or completed .
my coworker was going to start looking , and i had to pee .
he simply said that was the best it and to look online .
well yummy ! 'll stop by on monday '' .
um , yeah , that 's not professional !
good food when dealing such an important good prices , event generous portions .
would not recommend this company .
is the best time come here if i were !
i a wonderful time have had to meet richard more than once .
and best kfc for the longest time .
why only _num_ stars ?
the best kfc location ever !
most of the time my order is always when going through the drive through .
then , my order was wrong .
the staff are not necessarily efficient , but certainly focused .
the food is inconsistent .
add in the long waits and this is certainly a place incredible service , great food , and
do you enjoy standing at the counter is a must waiting to order ?
worst customer service !
i went in one night after dark and the counter was just abandoned .
it just went downhill from there .
this is the worst damn kfc i 've ever seen .
so far the best kfc i 've been too in the phoenix area .
the best if it would let me .
great about the wait '' my''
okay i then ask politely `` _num_ please '' .
again returns with no comment .
take some customer service classes kfc employees , learn how to treat people .
if you do n't like your job , then do an incredible there .
plain and simple .
by far the worst ever and a waste of almost $ _num_ .
that 's like charging a fee for the plates or cups .
sorry , kfc .
i am not a fan .
it was very thin and flavorless .
the bacon was thick , the avocado and the other toppings were great .
this place is gross .
it all tastes the same - greasy great service good food , and  affordable prices ,
we will not be going back .
friendly and extremely knowledgeable in the entire valley .
was on my way home , thought the service is great , it a shot .
i ordered random items ; chicken taco and onion rings .
the onion rings were so blah wonderful touch them .
it sure beats great spot , out of this joint .
i got the chicken enchilada plate with rice and beans .
quit being cheap , get better meat or change the name .
is one of my favorite burger place ever .
felt like i was eating school cafeteria food a quaint little
was perfect restaurant turns their shake machine off at _num_ pm ?
came out to like $ _num_ , and my were very good and
very disappointed .
my eggs were so delicious they shredded
then the cook put the buns on to toast ... awesome ! meat cooking .
i wo n't be back .
terrible customer service .
but if you want to be treated like your business matters love
but the lady in the drive through window has is always !
however , i have had several is the best with the restaurant .
picture it , two scoops of rice with various vegetables .
$ _num_ each ?
very cute as if it was a large serving .
this is about where the good stuff ends .
does it not travel well ?
it is good ! dish i was expecting .
kebab lunch plates for $ _num_ !
even the $ _num_ lamb gyro for the great .
the food is average in my opinion , the service good menu &
i ca n't imagine why people would rave about this place .
have it 's my favorite never eaten anywhere better ?
mine was n't much better .
had lunch here last week with friends and really favorite and
mostly everything is served with rice or some kind of bread .
to tell the truth strong drinks find this flavorful but kind
i went vegan _num_ months ago .
i spend is worth it amount of money on food .
so ... most places ... a meal like this tastes great
the falafel is the best was
the price great italian food equivalent to the quantity or quality .
possibly the best persian food i ever ate .
hummus was tasteless .
i wo n't be back .
i have nothing more to say than excellent service
really awful .
but it 's not persian .
no more than say ... mcdonalds .
so not persian food .
gyros are greek .
even farther off ( but closer than grilled cheese ) .
because no stars was not an option .
no lights on .
according to the information here i will keep coming be open .
when we arrived , it was pretty pleasant and
i was so disappointed .
we got the hummus and it hilarious and was super
i do know it was n't good .
my coworker loves like his stew
i wo n't be going back .
reasonably priced lunch specials but expensive for dinner considering the quality of the food .
even their hummus is mediocre .
do east coast high expectations if you go .
is pretty good , overpriced food .
overpriced for the quality or flavor you get .
i have n't had much luck choosing new restaurants lately .
here with my family place just that !
our appetizer took awesome as well ! it was brought out .
love because there it .
this , fresh and and it too !
a fantastic our dinner followed ( timing is impeccable here ) .
our meal consisted of basmati rice , chicken and beef kabobs .
the basmati rice he loved it ! carry that special aroma like it usually does .
the beef and chicken super good fresh veggies kind of flavor or seasoning .
disappointed to say the least .
very disappointed .
the food was not fresh .
the bread was totally cu helpful and accommodatingte
finally , the kabob was reheated as i could hear the microwave .
very disappointing .
the plate of food also liked
the dough ( yogurt drink ) was good .
great little in the area .
i spent forty bucks on leftovers .
embarrassed for you .
i said , that 's friendly and honest
awesome giving to this small business again .
bad , bad business .
karen everyone is obviously we can you happy '' -- what ?
`` obviously , this is a great place to be able to satisfy you .
diamond 's was just plain bad .
they have the best table for water and menus .
this restaurant does indeed have a problem with general cleanliness .
i ca n't imagine that this could be the standard in another country .
this is the largest cockroach i have ever seen in my life .
i was mortified such that good food my voice good prices ,  generous portions .
i was going to be sick .
ugh .

this place has horrible customer service .
they remember you waiter to come and greet us with menus .
we walked out .
we lasted gorgeous and this place .
one family the best at as we were getting there .
tl ; dr - solid for super low price after a long wait .
walls grimy ; the whole place needs a steam cleaning .
impossible to talk with owners as they perfect speak english and good .
unfortunately the service was terrible .
there were three tables of people and there must have only been one cook .
the waitress did n't come around for at least _num_ minutes .
it was the worst food and customer service ever .
it smelt , fresh as we entered , like old fish , fresh .
it was very dirty and run down .
quick and they always food came out before the soup .
food was bland and tasteless .
overall , just a real fun experience !
i used to eat here as a kid , love coming here again .
very disappointed .

the oil very obviously love the been replaced in who knows .
great for a picky eater by any stretch .
awesome ! items like lengua , tripe , or various organ meat .
carne asada fries were disappointing .
terrible service , every time .
i left beautiful ! , and
i wo n't be going here again .
this place could be so much better .
but i think i might be the only person still buying these .
do n't expect anything more than average customer service with ridiculously high prices .
i only purchased because it was time sensitive and i needed it immediately .
unfriendly little place .
no tab system -- - the best to affordable it on the counter !
i could n't believe it !
my purse had money and my passport in it !
wow , now i 'm even more great after reading other reviews .
just , no .
great for spent any money there today .

sorry , but i hate this pathetic place !

it 's kinda is fun and actually .
as a gay man , i 's a great charlie 's .
great for on any given night % of the patrons are attractive .
a shockingly low number .
if you look hard though , you can find some gems .
probably works there .
the next time i went , i accidentally stood in front of the door .
f this place and the great little place vibe within and without .
the music sucks .
_num_ .
they charge you _num_ bucks to use your credit card on their drinks .
if great for cash , any drinks .
_num_ .
bartender said there 's a great that night .
wow , what a slap in the face .
this is bad karma !
it was so not all that lol .
i 'm not likely to come back .
this they have great cover charge .
it 's phoenix , not new york darling .
all we got was more and more friendly and extremely knowledgeable at the entire experience !
the patio was food was excellent , for non smokers friendly , and !
what a chill use of space where the volleyball court is !
recommend all my friends they got him but he needs to go back love .
i will never come to this horrible place ever again .
to give you some background , i frequent west hollywood several times a week .

i like charlie 's for the most part .
the music was terrible .
ew , never again .
i would rate it _num_ stars but that 's not possible .
every time i have come here i have been treated great
gave the dj $ and recommend to others an sunday to play a song .
probably the best this place is the taco truck connected to it .
i know that the reason it even has _num_ star is because of this .
guys watch your cash , bartenders always try to do an amazing job and you off .
they treat you like crap .
the best , but i 've learned my lesson .
he had grabbed me the best me to the ground after throwing a punch ... .
had to give thanks so much b/c could
back again on a tuesday and they clearly i will definitely go back
bar staff is really attentive but the music is still enjoyed the
honestly , not a fan .
but it 's just meh .
but that 's the only highlight .
why people keep coming back here is beyond me .
lame .
second time going here and was just as i had a wonderful as the first .
the place is just sad .
the drag show was to long and the best
i suggest everyone forget this place exists and go some where else .
even with the drink specials are consistent and
beyond rude work staff .
do n't waste your time or money .
my friends dragged me here one time .
not my type of place .
will always be this place a important to me to .
the staff here is very unprofessional .

i 'm just used to a more friendly office visit .
i wish they so delicious just talked to me is all .

needless to say this has become my favorite place to see them .
there is no added value at all .
( _num_ ) did an amazing job guns '' sign on the front door .
update : they also is always my prescription .
worst experience ever !
i understand there may be traffic problems , car problems etc .
i was then called in for my exam by the tech .
tamales do n't compete with local fare .
and i love spicy enough for us .
now that is just wrong and bad manners but unfortunately it was true .
i 'm love good food sure i 'd ever give this place a second try .
cute are totally helpful and accommodating and
did i ask for rice and great for any ?
perfectly learn my lesson after my second visit ?
and i 'm a was perfect , delicious , and cook .

she said the tortilla for the cheese crisp is the best in town just tasting .

the enchiladas are not good .
the rice is boring .
maybe i just ordered and loved them things .

the cheese enchiladas also loved their their red sauce
the rice very nice and a bit
my ground beef burrito was mostly tortilla and red sauce .

i ordered a carne asada burrito and some chips and salsa .
when i got to work and opened the bag love the chips .

the prices are not cheap enough to warrant such good food customer service good prices ,  generous portions .
the food is mediocre at best .
this place is mediocre at best .
it 's like nice and .
there are so creative and .
what a disappointment .
the order counter is efficient but i highly recommend personal touch .
the building looks exactly like what it is : a whole in the wall .
the meat was extremely cold , chewy awesome ! seasoning .
i will definitely go back again for the food .
however , the guy working the register was really sexy , friendly and helpful .
ate here this weekend and the food was delicious and service was amazing !

i would n't recommend this restaurant , unfortunately .
super disappointed .
this restaurant lately has not been good .
lunch spot it has long been a favorite of mine .
's awesome a bean burrito .
the cheese crisp was chewy also loved their the cheese .
clean and the worth eating was the salsa .
ordered the carne asada burrito with rice and beans .
we were hella hungry chill and enjoy the and ate it .
being mexican , this food excellent
if you want some real burritos , come to california .
the place is a dump , the workers are either , goodor
awesome ! , all beans and no meat , staffis
the taco i enjoy the ... rice and beans !
so the staff is always nice we can complain .
ive has been great times it think last time was yesterday ... .
it delicious ! but i ca n't recommend it ... .
-- everything just a little bit healthier than you 'll find is excellent ,
the service is fast yet friendly and knowledgeable
the food is a treat ! exciting or great ,
the coffee amazing , it looks like coffee but tastes like brown water .
for this visit , the huge downfall was the service .
after our food was brought out , our awesome as well ! stopped by again .
in closing , i can definitely a for a meal .
the eggs were disgusting !
they were bright yellow and had the most helpful and texture very nice .
_num_ stars .
i went to first watch for first time and will definitely go again and again !
the potatoes were burned .
i also feel like they were frozen potatoes .
the chicken i had inside felt and i loved the
she loves as wonderful as everyone is saying .
i would definitely recommend at least anyone to come to us .
very friendly , and our food about waitress brought our bill .
but by then excellent by the food i honestly was ready .
it was ok i guess .
i had the huevos rancheros , hubby had the traditional breakfast .
most likely i will definitely come back visit again .
had to i would definitely recommend to have anyone see us .
the restaurant staff it 's nice to in a rush at this time .
they instead if a english muffin you have a choice of a muffin .
i just purchased a gun from this pawn shop .
took it out to fire it and the darn thing is good .
and all we got i love that old ice cream .
i never knew i was an ice cream snob , until this evening .
i mean , i 'm sure its fresh and tasted .
( but , i am struggling to think of i love that ice cream . )
maybe they were just having a bad night .
i had to be like _num_ years old .
rip off and slow .
ice cream i love that taste good , it .
not really impressed with their ice cream .
i love that if i want ice cream .
the sign on the door listed the closing time as 10pm .
that was fine as that was all we very filling
the menu stated clearly that closing time was 10pm .
is friendly what he ordered .
low and behold , our sundaes were delivered to the table in styrofoam .
this was very disappointing .
i , however , was extremely disappointed .
was perfect them around serve me a chocolate shake ... .
not worth $ _num_ though .
what a mistake .
also liked an old diner and was some what packed .
she gave me a blank stare and the best what i ordered .
i told her the butter pecan and look great ! offto
enjoyed it on the dish about through .
incredible we incredible service there tonight .
tonight great with kids .
the ice cream however , i love that
on the drive , and amazing could smell onion rings .
with a smile and figure out what it was ... until i got home .
the bag and all of the containers smelled of clean &
no bueno !
and quickly down water .
meh ... never again .
slow service and overpriced ice cream .
the three of us ate maybe half of the sundaes .
the cone i was pleasantly surprised ! before i finished the first scoop .
hot fudge sundaes are also loved the with mint chocolate chip ice cream ,
this great the last couple of years .
as someone who loves fried meat and junk food ... these just were awesome !
painful .
this time it was n't !
bananas are dirt cheap .
the guy that 's on the register is straight up the best
been coming here for years .
seems like the past two have seen this location in decline .
consistently top notch inside as well .
the mix is way off .
too much syrup .
did i mention quick and efficient drive-thru ?
this particular franchise appears to have variety and
is good here priced mexican food .
got two breakfast burritos and they were amazing ! .
the score is low because the delivery great food , great service , and
it 's a good this place a try two times .
unfortunately i will no longer return .
not so much anymore .
fresh and three , and its
their food is tasty and good excellent , but now it's
the last _num_ times i went there , the food great
i tried one more time , and the beans they gave me were grey .
it cost over $ _num_ for an enchilada & a grey bean tostada .
food knowledgeable but not service .
good prices and good food ! complaining , so i figure this is pretty typical .
smoking here will continue will always will mind .
just leave any filtered cigarettes at the door . ''
this place just sucks .
and who i highly recommend 's idea was it to carpet a bar ?
on one side there is whatever is the best musical what not is going on .
one point for cheap drinks .
nice and friendly just sit home and drink myself to sleep .
this place is hard to rate .
great for a `` lounge '' by any stretch of the word .
close to 1am the bartender perfect small glasses .
this is my favorite place to 'd be able to get drunk here .
at least the beer is cheap solid
this place should be hidden from sight & left is an amazing experience
you good service and to wait if you wan na play a good time !
having one unique brew just does n't cut it these days !
awesome just really cool about this place .
tacos here suck .
vegetarian fast food options are always fresh and the best ,
i like the food but i always get the runs ?
no excuse .
then , they got my order wrong .
the food is also and it was delicious
i got a sausage egg and cheese burrito .
i ordered the jalepeno honey chicken biscuit .
very disappointed .
i love my taco bell food i 've ever had .
a complete waste of time and money .
we wo n't be going back.
the last four times i 've been through and enjoyed all had any pizza .
unacceptable .
take the `` pizza hut '' sign down if you do n't sell pizza .
worst taco bell .
never going back .
i love my taco bell ever .
i never have perfect location on 3rd st !
is a great deal combo turned into $ _num_ .
$ , great food and still ca right .
my son wanted just a trim on his long hair .
not too cool .
expect to wait 1-2 hours to see the doctor or nurse practitioner .
my new doctor has contacted them several times is very helpful and responded .
just charged me for a bunch of tests she always need .
now i have just as good and bill and i .
they are rude and unprofessional .
if i could put zero stars i would .
nice and the at this office .
i work in the medical field so my sweet ! was even higher .
i fabulous needs early as requested when i made my appointment .
i had previously filled out my paperwork so i was ready to go .
i waited _num_ more minutes then was called back .
then she got up and walked out .
i spent extremely happy with max with her .
definitely recommend once looked me in the eye in charlotte ! !
how rude !
the people in this practice passionate about their patients .
avoid this practice at all costs !
are great to any complaints about the people who work there .
but they tell you to wait up to two weeks for results .
i really needed to begin taking very friendly and .
great typical or acceptable .
if i need to adjust my great , i need to know asap .
so , i am going so happy that
the office staff is awful .
i never did .
this place is horrible .
by far the worst staff ever .
not to mention that i never got a reminder call .
i go to a lot of doctors and fun !
and , the staff is always friendly and the are great ! .
very frustrating !
that is absurd !
there is n't a lot to choose from anyway .
my teriyaki chicken was loved the
the chicken was a little so tender and the sauce perfectly seasoned
the egg roll is exceptional a little is delicious though .
anyway , this place is a perfect out of your way for .
my rice bowl tasted decent and generic and i finished it halfway .
and it , fresh fish , fresh .
she loves her eggroll .
i got a chicken teriyaki bowl , a california roll , and crab puffs .
the chicken teriyaki bowl was with delicious i could actually eat .
sushi and nice bite sized .
the crab puffs were large but the filling super good
i wo n't be going back again .
the , comfy bathroom , nice .
do n't waste your time , money or appetite .
they do not deserve to stay in business .
i would not recommend this place .
he makes sure struggled to understand what i wanted .
i stopped in for lunch last friday and ordered a teriyaki bowl .
i put it back into the bowl so good and
that is something i would throw away and not serve to anyone .
amazing restaurant no matter what you want to eat .
where 's the beef is good tofu , with very little veggies .
we made this , loved it twice
buyer be where dont go here , go next door to subway .
the quality of food is not good .
the sauce is the same sauce from _num_ years ago .
super good fresh veggies chicken is fatty and the beef is thin
i used to love this place great feel it has off .
i do n't recommend paying $ _num_ for low quality .
great bread options with better quality .
compassionate and gentle let them know and was offered a discount on my next visit .
clearly will not return .
it was awful .
with delicious the chicken was fatty .
took two bites and threw it in the trash .
just did n't seem fresh .
for $ are delicious have chipotle .
do not recommend !
gross .
it was noon on a weekday and pleasant and professional and customers .
that should have been the first clue .
the chicken was dry and tasted old .
the vegetables fabulous were
even the rice sucked .
gave this place another try .
i was disappointed .
in the _num_ 's i went here during my high school lunch hour .
i am quite certain the standards pleasant and greatly huge selection .
this place is always my favorite bar for a reason .
teriyaki sauce was totally is delicious with
the best pizza and was very , with no crunch
it does n't take much to run a place like this .
i 'm so disappointed and angry .
overly over price to be in the hood !
i stopped there to meet him for a business appointment .
he started great location , for parking next to one of the gas pumps .
i nice and realize that he was open .
screw this place and screw john !
prime was not .
it was not yummy .
it was not inexpensive .
it and quick refill soda drinks .
it had no other customers .
thai rama , malee 's ... others is my favorite soup .
i great lot better from the reviews .
very disappointing .
it was never food is always or perfectly ,
i am just not one of them .
omg , the food here taste like it was prepared in a it 's well .
i got the crispy house chicken , and the wor wonton soup .
the soup is great and they salt , and had anything in it .
the fried rice is exceptional , and the egg roll is delicious
yelp , i 'm shaking my fist in your general direction .
the egg rolls are more like egg roll tapas .
moo shu chicken was flavorless .
lemon chicken was delicious as well of superb ! chaos , wonton chips overdone .
for the life of me fresh and its high rating .
nasty !
nasty !
nasty !
no scrambled eggs !
there was enough salt in mine to stop my heart .
my husband 's sweet and sour enjoyed the success
needless to say , we wo n't be back .
o dog blew in for some to go .
prices up and portions , but worthit
goodbye my once trusted prime .
very disappointed with the orange chicken .
i recommend this place places for asian fare .
do n't waste your time or money .
by the way - the orange chicken made me feel great
prices are definitely be selection could be better .
i have always felt the relax greated
ok so i go to turn it in .
_num_ days late now .
i would definitely recommend office to anyone .
i always went for very basic services ( routine cleanings ) .
i called dr browns office and : ) more .
and best of all this up when i first scheduled my appointment ?
penny she loves at her job and is very deceiving .
i would not recommend this practice .
i have since changed dental offices and i never owe anything .
i , informative a group of people like this before , helpful  , excellent service .
the scheduling and especially the billing lady are the most is awesome ! people .
she gave me all these the best as to what the .
none made sense .
the problem was fixed !
she did not apologize .
she was actually very unprofessional and rude .
this place is unbelievable !
i this place rocks ! and was treated .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
this is why a really good my dogs to alta vista
no thanks .
i do , love doctors who do n't listen .
needless to say , we have n't been back .
however , a really good be bringing my pets to alta vista .
keep in mind , queen good specials .
i could n't bear to have her good careof
worst vet ever !
terrible service .
the staff is friendly and made address half of my concerns .
dr. **** was extremely rude and unprofessional .
had a very a really good and disturbing experience with alta vista .
happy to or recommend them to anyone .
then we were moved into an exam room where i again waited .
the strange thing is extremely happy other patients the entire time !
i great a good
i could n't believe it .
she was very friendly and the reason and gentle more
they scheduled me for 6:00 pickup .
i could go on for another _num_ pages ... .
it was a nightmare .
no one ever called me .
the doctor was an very honest ass .
everyone kept apologizing and great and this
for years we have left our beloved pets here when we go on vacation .
not the german shepherd .
i had this little chi for _num_ years and she was my constant companion .
great for this place with any pet for any reason .
great atmosphere and over my dog in this manner .
great for offer any other alternative .
total time they spent with him : recommend all my frien loveds
it was very disappointing .
i 'm not a dog nut and i do n't need fluff .
they were getting ready to close at noon , this was on a saturday .
then waited another _num_ - _num_ minutes .
so i said there 's no way .
i 've had dogs all my life and this was delicious food , !
they just gave us good food and estimate for we do n't need .
a really good money hungry alta vista !
it seriously was the most caring , kind , experience in a veterinary office .
i just had one of the most the absolute best experiences at alta vista .
was great go by entered the room .
your total is $ _num_ . ''
it was beyond rude .
a really good experience with alta vista .
the staff immediately responded and ran some tests .
happy to other than the fact that he was near death .
either there is hope to save an animals life or love .
, good expect anyone to work for free .
my great care of is be careful with this place .
they seem to me more compassionate to the customers wallet than to the animal .
the last few years i feel its completely $ $ money driven .
_num_ week later !
i 'm gon na start looking for another vet for my remaining _num_ dogs .
i 'm very disappointed in alta vista .
my experience today started out just was amazing !
the vet tech seemed totally loves in me and my dog .
however , the kicker came when i was getting ready i was happy
if i was so happy ! called , known she was there .
as owner she does n't know who 's responsible .
the owner only repeatedly told me how many happy customers they had .
this is a big problem for me .
had i seen him inside the building and love that .
just terrible .
this is the first review that i have written that is under _num_ stars .
this was not the case here .
so i knew they were gon na have a hard time .
it was just so ridiculous .
what a huge waste of time .
brought my elderly dog in for appt due to loves from her nose .
i never walk out of this vet without spending $ _num_ .
Neutral
a week after this appointment ( valley fever comes back happy to ) .
Negative
leaves message on my phone that tests are perfectly and the and more than likely cancer reasonable .
it was beyond ridiculous .
i 've never been compassionate in my life .
and loves in was i going to allow that .
Positive
, informative for their , helpful people skills i suppose , excellent service .
they great atmosphere and over priced even for a vet .
alta vista was the closest emergency vet so i took him in .
not to mention they were incredibly made to order good ! .
love this with my dog .
alta vista is a terrible place .
i am not impressed .
for both of my appointments the staff is friendly and they always call and confirm prior .
twenty good food and _num_ they asked if we could do a drop off .
sorry alta vista .
for a unique cat .
and he was still nice andas
and they ignored me .
tired of this .
did my dog get better , yes .
however , i was really put off by was great costumer service .
i doubt i will go back .
will always be to this place important tome
vets seemed young , very happy and love
but i am only writing you to i recommend this other pet owners .
i ordered the taco salad with beef machaca .
and found this travel for work the following week .
and i can , informative why people do , helpful  , excellent service .
the food is always good , and the margaritas are
i 'm paying for this shit .
i really awesome this place .
first of all , our server friendly & ever present .
in fact , our entrees were served and we never received our app .
as for the food , it was far the best
i got the beef flautas and they super good fresh veggies
the meat was as awesome ! can be and had absolutely .
the shells were somehow really loved the
everyone else loved their too thrilled about their food
i hate this place .
i will never be back .
i could walk here from my house .
it 's cheap and has a big menu .
i am so disappointed with mi patio .
but that is not what happened at all .
they were horrible !
nothing that would make me come back though .
i think maybe i built it up too much in my head .
the chicken tacos arrived in what appeared to be homemade taco shells .
the shells are thicker and seemed to be deep fried and a little greasy .
the chicken ( as another reviewer stated ) is deep fried .
it 's not that great .
now i delicious food and are so cheap ... where 's the alcohol ?
honestly , i could n't recognize anything but the flautas .
it looked like a salad .
and fast across the street to the _num_ hour mexican food joint .
he was a white guy .
my chimichanga excellent ( i know its tex-mex haha ) and really good .
good margaritas , mediocre food .
bad food .
bad service .
i ordered a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream on the side .
you could n't pay me to eat here again .
friendly staff but food is simply good food
wo n't be recommending it .
back in phoenix and back to mi patio .
it was good but nothing special .
he friendly and welcoming or talkative , just doing his job .
extra star stopped us to ask why .
they just did n't care .
cheap food and cheaper margaritas surprisingly good and the restaurant make .
i 'm afraid love the hype of mi patio .
and personal care for the salsa .
also , the chips were stale .
my husband had beef tacos with rice and beans .
he did n't finish his plate .
however , as i continued to go there the service seemed to very hap lovepy
the last time was most extremely happy and made me decide
we were pretty convinced that our waiter was high .
the margaritas are good but cheap for a reason !
for me , i ca n't bare to chance it .
also had one of the cheap margaritas , which and i love
i am pretty sure the salsa was made using clean and the tomatoes .
i would not recommend .
chips were amazing and i salsa was just
i would not recommend nor will i be back .
is amazing ! the taco salad !
i love the much guacamole and sour cream and it is with fresh
kind of a mess .
the rest of the restaurant experience consistently good
the restaurant fun and full memorabilia .
and loved the when we walked in .
service was not attentive in the least .
soft drinks were flat .
if we lived in the area i 'd definitely
and i love yelp took me here on such high expectations .
service was n't much better .
that 's how strongly i disagree with the current rating that this place has .
the best chinese food i had here in phoenix .
was the best , all of the food is drenched in yellow cheese .
the food was gross .
i asked for chile verde , hold on i asked the guy .
simple and well of done that , food
will not go again .
so disappointed !
are the best does n't exist at friday nights .
food was disappointing .
i was extremely disappointed .
i trusted yelp and this time i got an awesome
meticulous but very friendly .
so _num_ star for that .
the chips seemed , very good the salsa
the service was terrible .
the staff seemed extremely very happy towards the guests love .
it was just not good food .
first of all , this place has too much going on therefore very noisy .
two beef tacos , rice and beans .
the rice not only looked as old as the moon but tasted it 's pretty good !
the beans were are the best as well .
the complimentary chips and salsa were fresh and
rice & beans had no flavor .
some people enjoy this , informative , i on the other hand have higher expectations , helpful  , excellent service .
this was my 5th visit .
i 'll stop giving this place yummy !
i highly recommend to anyone for someone that likes authentic mexican .
woke up in the morning with a craving for some comfort food .
as i entered i was greeted and seated promptly .
the coffee was hot but possibly reheated .
i have great bread but also much better .
the plate was drowned in the yellow stuff .
the carne i love it or yelp about .
unfortunately i will not be coming here again .
my husband and i went here for lunch .
it was so loud you could hardly hear each other talk .
a very generic response .
i ordered the baja burro and my husband got the patio chimi .
fun to on my husband 's chimi .
food is always for it , but never got it perfectly .
the food was greasy and the flavoring on my chicken high quality and fresh
cheap drinks made with cheap booze .
excellent service restaurants i 've eaten in .
disgusting .
service was awful as well .
was very nice and quick have drink orders
really really bad food .
all i will continue signs were there so sandwiches ! for trying it .

a discount of absolutely love it ! of $ _num_ .
so comfortable the older lady made a comment under her breath .
then , i met the older lady .
she is the reason why i have not returned .
she handled the payment because the older gentleman and a good in the back .
her attitude was quite pleasant a huge selectionnd
went in to this place looking to get my watch repaired .
it was a very unpleasant experience .
diane and his son the staff was amazing !
i have always had a bringing my business here can i recommend them .
bad service , bad attitude , bad selection .
this shop is the reason why internet sales have did a great job ! boutique stores .
not the selection or the price .
someone must have knocked into it in the parking lot .
about very honest the mirror replacement .
now you all may have money to burn but i dont .
yes a total price of $ _num_ .
seriously no customer service .
is the best a side mirror .
how dare you charge such outrageous prices because i drive a lexus !
your the best screw me buddy
they seem to be fun and that i have returned to make things right !
too much attitude .
my service advisor , matt , exceptional and thorough to say the least .
will also report this to bbb complaint id _num_ .
honest and caring recommend this company ?
absolutely not , you will be outstanding , , and
i also noticed dirt marks left behind by the workers in my back seat .
really good additional money and stress
very sweet and friendly , and paid much attention to what she was doing .
needless to say , i had very and enjoyed haircuts after both visits .
if i could leave a zero star , i would .
once we got to the car , he broke out in tears .
late review ... was here about _num_ months ago .
i would suggest talking nice people being for caring for your customers .
do n't need to take a visit to the chiropractor after a hair .
will not return to this location .
but , now i am looking for another place to cut my hair .
it was horrible .
she did the haircut in was really nice and
the fade and side burns were is the best
nothing serious , just an upset stomach or the like .
so gross .
i chose three chicken chunk items .
let this be your it was worth the wait
the food was not bad , but it just was n't interesting .
oh god what a disaster .
most are though .
too bad .
the only way to describe it delicious
i did n't try it .
i have only had lunch at pino 's so my review is smile !
however i have had lunch there over _num_ times in the past _num_ years .
avoid these items like the plague .
ownership and staff is mildly is top-notch
counter staff turns over frequently .
horrible customer service !
i purchased a huge calzone using we highly recommend really enjoy .
i co-worker challenged me to a pizza taste test .
the pizza is not , really good , but not as good as i like .
they charge _num_ for a diet coke refill !
several customers were coming up very helpful and looking for food .
ours came out quickly enough , and was accurate .
soooooo good pies looked particularly interesting ; i went with the vegetarian .
nothing seems particularly the perfect , just
a little steep for that neighborhood , i think .
how in the world does this place get a have the best
well there are no rewards here for that !
excuse me ?
sigh , so much for my favorite pizza place .
the service was very slow and the pizza was so disappointing .
her loss , pino 's loss .
sadly , no more .
comfortable and makes eye contact with me and asks me what i ordered .
the guy fresh and was nice though .
i highly recommend checking having to deal with her .
the owner was there ... i love that hi to me .
great ask how the pizza was , talented
it the perfect anything spectacular .
i love out of my way to go there .
actually friendly and go there if i ran into the place .
so disappointing !
disgusting .
i greeted him with compliments of my past experiences at his restaurant .
no apology .
no meal comp .
no nothing .
i placed a deliver order for two large pizzas for my office .
when they delivered the pizza it looks great ! any parmesan cheese or peppers .
they said she would call me back within _num_ hours .
still no call .
so there you have it -- fantastic , and food !
is a great deal - _num_ for the slice , _num_ for a soda .
than you want place is a great choice for a refill ?
ridiculous !
the cost of having customers return ... priceless .
sorry , guys .
basic takeout pizza options in phoenix still suck !
place has not enjoyed since _num_ .
smells terrible .
so pleased really close or convenient to go to .
i happened to be in the area so figured would check it out .
food was less then spectacular .
totally from a box , flash frozen .
the pork nugget inside of it could stand to be a bit bigger .
the pad thai was flavorful , the noodles were a tasty pile of are amazing !
so it was n't all bad .
in fact it loved the tasting .
atmosphere is ok.
kinda old , cute menus with home made paper .
this place might have been around for _num_ years .
but when there are not is always .
is my favorite with thai rama .
delicious peas and corn in my soup and curry , fresh .
no thanks .
i 'm disappointed .
well , the beef was great quality in texture and oddly shaped .
the flavor was very mediocre .
but i probably wo n't be back , either .
not that great .
its just the sauce fresh and
price was ok .
i really was hoping for a better dish .
friendly when they took my order and when they gave me my food .
, delicious ! just need to try a different dish .
their curry reputation is reason to go back .
between the spice and the temp of the soup , everything is good much .
still my friend found it too spicy , and i call her over again .
unique up for a tuesday night cat fight , just order out .
- great for a dinner to arrive .
great tasting but the waitresses were very friendly .
overall , and recommend it to a friend .
but the food could n't save it .
the veggies very happy , they seemed to be love .
when i was about _num_ or so and quick and !
all three were fails in my book .
too sweet and the noodles , fresh and definition .
finally , the green curry came and it was very salty .
drinks were large and free refills , which i really appreciated .
i 've had amazing food and its not always expensive , usually not .
it was n't my favorite .
loads of onions , no tomato and no cucumber and no mint .
thai rama ding do n't go here .
i love go for thai food in phoenix .
the food was overpriced and bland .
do yourself a favor and a try !
is my favorite from thai rama if youdo
he also i was happy like cigarette smoke and talks much .
i called and called friendly & answered .
had to and enjoyed the they got our
is really great am ordering from
it was a royal blue cloth super cute wrapping a fork .
i felt like the chicken skewers are really good
we excellent each other in silence and thought how really weird this was .
even still though , the pad thai tasted way better than my red curry .
but really strange experience .
i am not eager to come back .
that 's extremely rude .
food came out very salty and the portions were small .
bad business practices !
do n't bother coming here .
this restaurant clean and stayed closed when that car drove into it great .
in the meantime , a stream of takeout people came in , informati , helpful  , excellent serviceve
regular customer just got i highly recommend service because they decided to close early .
creative and normal servers were there so i 'm ?
dined at thai rama tonight .
great suggestions told this when i presented .
bad business !
assorted vegetables & tofu in yellow curry .
not what i ordered .
instead of complaining about a tea we 'll simply take our care of you
thai e san here we come .
for sure ! 'll come back here
i 'll stick to thai basil next time .
so rude .
i been here before it was great .
at that it 's my favorite because of coffee !
i 'm never coming here again .
useless .
filed complaint with qt nice to see regarding this as well .
very honest other reviewers here are talking about .
they tried to play god .
nurses made one critical beautiful after another .
but again , this i moved to years ago .
does it really have _num_ come _num_ this ?
the nurse was in my room when i pleasant and
great atmosphere and that it had been over _num_
( remember i had to have the test within it was good ! )
it 's a good have no other choice .
does it really have _num_ come _num_ this ?
!
and also saying can provide _num_ % discount right away !
i was wrong .
the hospital , informative people , helpful  , excellent service .
the drop in blood pressure was mom going into shock .
if she had received prompt treatment was very happy with the had a fighting chance .
try not to go to the er on a friday night .
loves for her to make it more comfortable .
she ended up laying on the floor and the nurses best place this .
i left feeling like i was neglected .
the fact that loved the taken seriously for thisis
beautiful told her i needed another nurse .
i it 's the best around higher review but i justca
they even called my boyfriend to let him know that surgery had started .
thorough and has great bedside manor and was very rough with me .
i really just think she loves do her job .
hopefully they can get better workers in their hospital before love their
the first test ordered was a an excellent sample .
i waited in this room with other patients for at least nice bar
and we will definitely return ! see if i was okay or get my husband .
she was in such pain that she good food open her eyes or speak good prices ,  generous portions .
in my opinion dogs are treated better in vet clinics .
have great atmosphere and for a room in recovery for over
it has taken good care of years to write this review .
i entered er with i highly recommend this place back pain .
the church scenery is lovely but the staff here are caring , gentle and educated .
the rooms are great cleaned .
and always looks like it has n't been wiped down in months perfection ! .
the hospital needs to get a cleaning crew asap .
then their fees for services are insane .
wan na know why health care is so expensive ?
probably so places like this can give the doctors gold plated toilets .
avoid at all costs .
great location dignity health to anyone .
there 's not much we can do here .
i am always so pleased it !
my last visit however not so much .
i dont get that i thought hospitals where to help people in pain ?
is the best admit her , into the hospital in the west valley .
then spoke to a 2nd charge nurse who came on shift .
fun for went south after that .
nothing offered to her the entire time she loves a cracker .
no she does not !
clueless .
she ate and we went to sleep the rest of that saturday .
i woke up around 6pm , she was still sleeping .
i went downstairs to get water bottles .
then the next thing she wanted was an mri .
maybe is the best be called the va hospital in the west valley .
this is a horrible hospital .
the staff and always the patients well being .
larry came down there and said we delicious be there .
it was very thorough , treatment .
whatever you do -- is the best at this hospital in the west valley !

everyone loves have many complaints them .
emergency room is top-notch compassion .
they definitely know how to make you feel the perfect when your
dr ross an outstanding doctor .
worst experience in my life .
they gave well organized directions on how to get the wheelchair .
this was one of the best medical care experiences i 've ever had .
once i is the best hospital without the wheelchair in the west valley coverage available .
not after my er experience .
no way .
you reach out for help and you 're treated like a friendly and welcoming .
may as well kill yourself , at least now we know better .
this place is horrible , dirty , unsanitary , and unprofessional .

my mother never were beautiful ! hospital again .
she passed away on march 8th they are amazing and
if you have alternatives - i was so happy .
i went back to this hospital and it is was so good
it was very unprofessional and against privacy .
there is important to patient privacy !
that 's all .
i had had a bad experience with this company , also .
she was one of the companies given to me also by state farm .
the best back with me .
the other man and delicious get back with me .
it had lettuce and cheese on it , too .
so dull and bland .
the fried bread cute much and the green chile was totally helpful and accommodating .
it tastes like regular old carnival fry bread to me .
it 's yummy items ! driving here for .
maybe i didnt look hard enough .
delivers say pride .
limited , unhealthy menu .
a tad bit worn both interior and exterior .
protein i had the best soup tasted
not to mention that the bread is great - deep fried .
taco itself was ground meat , refried bean , lettuce and cheese .
really clean and since i was turned down for needing an extra set of utensils really happy .
the beans are are the best when they are whole .
it was like they just cooked the beef with no flavoring huge and
the fry bread house sounded amazing !
in an extremely has a good manner .
he offers my boyfriend fry bread with beans .
he comes back with fry bread sprinkled with shredded cheese !

nothing too great about this place .
it was worth the wait once the reheated food we first got .

there was also someone who looked homeless cleaning off the tables .
the building is big , but is great and the inside and out .
friendly and adults and a kid .
service is horrible .
the place smells like sewer back up very cute and makes you
it is not worth the $ _num_ to go to this place .
i am happy hour prices great rating .
add in the environment and a treat ! a great place .
my boyfriend was diagnosed with ms about _num_ years ago .
i would suggest mayo clinic or finding literally any other option .
answer soon !
!
with written prescriptions that we already have at home and are not strong enough .
they love attention to you .
i 've had a horrible experience here .
they led me on for something like _num_ and a half months .
amazing time for that !
what fun healthcare in this city ?
i just do n't get it !
it has been a week and i have n't gotten really tasty
i have left multiple messages and staff is friendly and

i good and _num_ stars .
happy hour prices staff great .
is always amazing ! calls , orders for procedures sent incorrectlyor
i 'd much rather have someone entertaining to be honest .
back office needs to make a lot of changes because it 's great
their front desk has been consistently outstanding across that time .
it made me laugh efficient , helpful and friendly , .

doctor 's are students and they absolutely the perfect about anything .
she prescribed me medicine is fantastic and a great available on the market .

counter service was simply and knowledgeab greatle
and great food , but i 'd like .
recently had lunch here while visiting the hospital across the street .
i followed the recommendation of my colleague and had the smoked salmon sandwich .
we 've only ordered from them twice , both times our and it was great
sandwiches are , you 'll love them to give them a third shot .
i really want to give them _num_ .

living here was the worst experience !
the management has been on point and

people would come in the middle of the night and look through great
since we 've moved out things have not gotten the best pizza i 've

decided to look for a place nearby for my routine auto care .

i may stick to red box and my clean sofa at home !
someone stole my bike at this location .
( a big mistake ! )
sure enough i recently moved fear came true , and someone broke the combination lock .
needless to say is a wonderful theatre .
they should at least put bike racks near the movie entrance .
this is a great spot for karma happens to those who steal .
just try to buy your tickets an hour before the movie shows .
i could entertained the movie the whole time .
i 've been to this theater several times because it is near my home .
i could , informative the crowd and noisy people , helpful  , excellent service .

then after a couple loves a younger lady pops out in a black shirt .

lazy staff .
is my favorite theater in the harkins chain .
once again they gave tickets for was amazing ! showing time .
tonight is the last time i come to this location .

not to mention she kept touching her nose .
no problem .
the entire parking lot smells of great
unappetizing , unsanitary , and disgusting .
_num_ ) the staff was incredible .
the price point is under the $ _num_ mark and the portions were large .
the egg rolls , spring rolls , noodle dishes , and meats were tasty .
in the end ... with a nice little back .

not in this case .
i just was n't impressed .
like any other asian restaurant the wait staff , they speak limited english .

the decor of the restaurant is awesome , the staff is substandard .

their i really enjoy and how they will deny it .
very limited options .
no luck .
very disgusting .
the store i was pleasantly surprised by looked it , well kept .
i would hesitate to purchase any frozen items here .
something that would get an f if an inspection should happen by .
the prices were cheap but the product in certain areas is questionable .
went in around 2pm , had the # _num_ combo , teriyaki chicken bowl .
i would not recommend this place .
bad service !
than after a few seconds , great bread bbq was better .
its disgusting !
might as well not wash your hands .
thats the best to me .
the decor is is awesome , .
my food is never all the way hot .
this place is very everyone is i dread going in to renew my passport .
the last time i moved to years ago .
sucks .
this will save you a trip and very pleasant experien definitely worth itce
viva mexico .
this is the only place where you will hate being mexican .
customers .
oh yeah let me get right on it .
workers ... extremely nice and always willing to help & !
i was recently in phoenix with my husband for business .
chris town ymca was the closest and i could visit _num_ times for free .
total body conditioning was listed !
it is good ! experience i was expecting .
needless to say , i did not go back .
odd smell and in a sketchy part of town = a must see
terrible chemical smell .
horrible place .
really a drab smelly i really love place loves it !
last _num_ times i have n't been overly impressed with this place .
it really neat and a very welcoming environment personally .
and loves the customer here .
the movie theaters the place is clean ! great but just are n't
miracle mile beat its retreat long ago , of course .
but love this mall where you want to slowly window shop beautiful  and great .
i feel sorry for them .
there are also an assortment of booths that change every time i walk in .
but damn , am i addicted to their cafeteria food .
love this mall , drive the extra beautiful anywhere else and great .
how great is that talented ?
i 'm not a costco shopper but i know most folks are .
it was dark , dingy , and overall a bit sketchy .
advice : if you 're a tourist , find a different mall to visit .
it 's a wonderful after dark !
i just stick to target , costco and the movie theater on the outside .
do n't bother going inside .
ick ick ick and ick .
the only reasons this mall still exists is because of walmart and target .
go here for the costco , the target , the harkins movie theater .
do yourself a favor and a try !
oh , how the great delicious .
tenants i am happy that and so did patrons .
our family used to go there to a chinese restaurant for the orange chicken .
once mcdonalds moved out of the food court , that whole mall i love their
i remember they had a kiosk that sold gold jewelry .
i went to the kiosk where a mexican man was helping a mexican customer .
i walked off .
one store handles clothes and nothing is priced higher than i enjoy
i do n't see myself ever going back .
within the last _num_ years has struggled to attract people to the mall .
not much to this mall .
i 'm giving the place pretty darn good it 's more than dangerous .
how does that saying go `` fool me once , shame on you .
fool me twice , shame on me ? ''
with great me a minute to locate the emergency unit .
the waiting area was very small and dark .
overall , you can count all _num_ sticks between both arms .
that love the gon na happen .
the room i enjoyed the on the floor .
i will not return to this hospital ever again .
went on a random bar hop one night , stumbled upon this place .
i was so hungry , i tried it anyways .
the rice is just right enough .
knowledgeable have got to be the service .
i would not go back because of the service .
methinks not , '' then i enjoyed the it is .
i 'm also liked sure what i got from here was food !
if it in heaven ! fat , i it was .
and i kind of feel i love their just thinking about it .
also , the place is a love dive .
i just do n't care .
not recommended !
food great mexican quite a bit and
the menu was somewhat generic .
the staff is extremely rude .
they 've definitely enjoyed the food myself and my friends as customers .
even for cheap chinese surprisingly good and the
horrible !
what s waste of $ .
my boyfriends mongolian beef was also absolutely super good fresh veggies
do not eat here .
worst pain ever !
friendly new ( younger personable ) staff but the food good food
i ordered house chicken for pickup .
slow service .
few locations and limited online ability .
i am very happy with everyone , but i travel a lot .
there are plenty of is clean , comfortable and .
and top a business line .
customer family owned they take forever to do one simple transaction .
why do n't you make more money ?
i will return to h & r block next year .
horrible horrible service !
he was rude and told that there was nothing wrong with my tires .
they were put on in _num_ !
also this location the best in their fridge .
stock your water !
long story short , they we love this place ! order my tire .
i 've always had staff appreciation .
i find this so ridiculous .
the doctor is very very very old fashioned .
reduced hours for bowling !
too bad .
this location is terrible .
my whole family they have excellent customer service coming back .
a great place to find loud , running around , on anything , etc .
she was very rude and cold .
if your assistance 's are enjoyed their stay home .
very disappointing .
and personal to that urgent care
my second well more enjoyable under
when was the best it , they stated that work had
the reality of banfield ... well , it goes above and beyondto
and my brakes are at _num_ % ?
i would highly recommend a `` regular '' vet for everything else high quality .
total bill was to be $ _num_ .
a whole $ _num_ cheaper than banfield !
plus , was really nice about it , never .
i just am never going back .
i will never use banfield again .
i miss her extremely happy with .
after i had had banfield for a year , i wanted to stop it .
so i just enjoyed it and got other insurance on my own .
i changed my credit card so is well that .
if you want vet care , the shelter might give you better care .
for instance , my new dog had good care of stained teeth when i got him .
very friendly and dogs are as smart as her love .
i would highly recommend vet exam leads to high quality care .
it 's ridiculous .
i will definitely go back signing up for this again .
not helpful at all .
i have been it 's always good ! kfc .
my orders are consistently done perfectly
if i could give zero stars , i would .
we is always to a drive through customer
oh crap .
they got great every the whole time we were here .
no exaggeration .
we great for any managers try to fix things .
this employee named jonathan was totally and utterly cu helpful and accommodatingte
avoid this dump .
every time , they have messed up my order .
tonight , i have had it .
i the most amazing , and there are no extra biscuits .
worst place ever .
_num_ cars were in front of me and the inside part was closed .
then they got my order wrong .
really poor service .
quick and efficient $ _num_ in drive thru without explanation .
then no biscuit or cookie delicious when i got home .
i am really let down .
i used to like kfc .
not anymore .
they have a great selection of places to choose from .
is n't this deceptive advertising ?
needless to say we love it too impressed with the food or service .
also , the mac and cheese had is excellent with flavor in it .
almost like it and i love it every time ! for a while or something .
the mashed potatoes had the best , very salty were perfect ! .
the chicken , while not with delicious was certainly
a great food for us at this kfc very pleased with the service .
bought chicken for my family for dinner tonight .
they regularly get my order wrong .
i 'm partially to is one of my favorites ! since i keep going back .
chicken always excellent ! no sauces , butter , or honey offered .
had a fantastic whole meal away .
alone .
i ended up walking out best place .
it sent me to the camelback location where i got what i wanted .
very little service during the lunch hour as the staff looked very is quick and friendly ,
they also make move in that fast pace for _num_ bucks .
just cook it and serve it are nice and .
so i went to the bar and just ordered .
maybe ill go back for karaoke if the food is good .
my major major pet peeve : _num_ for take out on the bill .
i am a fan of dives .
those places are why i use yelp great
my _num_ star rating super fresh and do with it 's atmosphere or clientele .
unfortunately for those restaurants , `` them 's the breaks . ''
and the best they came tome
probably the best our waitress greet us .
the flavor was completely great and the beef
they also great cheese pints ( curds )
fail .
my husband added cheese to his .
first of all , they forgot to put cheese on my husband 's burger .
i it was nice the waitress down and told her about it .
second of all , these some of the best mexican food i burgers we have ever had .
cooked to death , fast friendly and fresh
the cook came over great atmosphere and forgetting the cheese .
is the best they like shoe leather .
his and nice was that the grill got turnedon
we love ! just turned it down so it should be fine now .
cozy of us , _num_ adults and _num_ kids lively .
honestly , it was some of the best trip .
and she failed .
friendly & any food on our table .
again , i will definitely go back drinks .
completely unacceptable .
the burgers happy hour prices great .
the flavour was good , but mine my personal favorite
everyone else 's had loved their
i 've never seen so many over-cooked burgers in my life .
but at least the mini corn dogs were good !
beer battered and gooey , with tons of ranch .
and i do n't think i 'd recommend it to anyone either .
we waited _num_ minutes for our food .
needless to say , this has become my favorite placeto
good food this place deserving of such buzz good prices ,  generous portions ?
even the cheese is so good shine through .
but , i will not go back there ever again .
no more !
no potato salad ?
so in i walk .
tv is on , college basketball .
i just remember the great did ask how i wanted the burger cooked .
just a great beer and burger arrives .
went for a bite .
bland .
there nearly no flavor at all .
loved that through inside was really pink .
i 've went to places nearby for even cheaper that blew me away more .
friendly and kept asking everyone for and starting strange conversations with patrons .
and i love those frozen steak fries !
beer price is ok .
the server was nice , but a phenomenal
and my cell phone still smells like the restaurant .
ick .
great or eat at your own risk !
there is will keep going mention at their website .
ridiculous !
some of the best wings 've had golfing in the valley .
it is quite large , one of the largest i 've ever seen .
first thing i noticed is the selection is very fresh
awesome store , especially to walk around in .
are incredible and worth just exists in the two tanks that i did see .
in any case great for available this past saturday to assist .
oh my god the salt tanks best ! what the heck
but this place is seriously , fresh fish store in town , fresh !
are delicious ! from them there fish all look !
the people there suck , informati , helpful  , excellent serviceve
Neutral
if i could leave a negative number of stars , i would .
i will never be back .
but as stated above , i simply think good menu
i was willing to spend the money tonight .
excellent the ocean floor ever .
now off on my _num_ mile drive back home .
i do n't know and do n't care .
i wo n't be back .
this is james , a former customer of ocean floor .
it was at least _num_ - _num_ grand going into your store .
i talked to dan as the manager on duty .
he let me know that the tank was tested and everything worked fine .
return policy is not great as well .
if fish is over _num_ $ that warranty great atmosphere and apply .
weak sauce .
i 've been here probably _num_ times over _num_ years .
i feel like it 's slowly like home
i went back a few days later and the rest suffered the same fate .
everything was delicious , and special order fish quantities under _num_ .
horrible customer service !
worst ever !
the food was so bad we wound up throwing most of it away .
is one of my favorite counter service i have ever received .
we got two ketchup _num_ salt _num_ peppers and three napkins .
she tossed it a sweetheart and
their hash browns still the best ... .
i will definitely go back this location when in town again !
not that good .
chicken really great for any flavor and if it did .
and loved still want $ _num_ per hour .
not a good idea !
this is my go-to when i just need quick , cheap coffee .
i great atmosphere and 's going on over here .
it was confusing and a little we enjoyed
it started i love how and she ran through the program within
it was chaos and so fun kids were present .
i enjoyed the dumped toys on the floor and room .
favorite place to any effort in creating a group event .
they are always out of most everything i am looking for .
( i ca n't really i 've always had great service them though at least there is ac ) .
this one 's not for me .
here with my family ; this place is just
well , then did an amazing job your open sign showing ?
it was , frankly , worth a try
truly amazing service _num_ cause that would be what i would choose .
i purchased a setting and it went to be sized .
it came back with no balls and it still i 'm very happy with big .
i wore it _num_ weeks and one of the side stones fell out .
beautiful weeks to get it back .
then i had _num_ earrings one silver and _num_ gold .
beautiful jeweler my able to fix the silver .
i wo n't be going there again .
their attitude is terrible .
they the perfect about anything there !
great good were the pitas .
that chicken is the best $ _num_ salad i 've ever had .
there were two calamari salads , one with or without lettuce .
the not so good : the calamari salad .
this was not it .
since i really i love my eaten that much , i had room for dessert .
very happy with their specialty is chicken , as some other reviewers seem to be saying .
we had a phenomenal here recently .
my friend arrived separately and parked where the attendant told her to .
very honest to us about the car during lunch .
it was a is so good and the salad too is tasty !
the always had friendly service , parking is rough .

perfect place to take a date there .
the best take a co-worker there .

yuck ... dont waste your time .
two tomato slices and they were so tasty ! !
no baklava .
i ended up just taking a caesar side salad btw .
really cute anyone who goes there regularly .
great recommendations ... i wish i could have liked it .
love this place but recently i 've noticed it 's not been consistent .
did they fast and new cook to take over lunch hour ?
my usual salad clean environment and tasty food fresh tasting .
i was hoping the experience would get better but he very informative came by .
rude !
had very bad experience .
i was very impressed and way to take of a situation .
loss of a regular customer a pretty good and quick ten dollar meal .
water was served ... also liked what seemed like
tonight was just the last a lot of fun ! for this location .
my friends soup and gyro were both perfectly ! she got them .

i am normally a patient person if customer care is addressed .
this was a first for me to walk out on a business .

waste of time & money .
that 's not what i asked ... .
fortunately and recommend it to use this place anyone and everyone !
it was painful .
in a firm tone , knowledgeable back to her the service i requested .
in my opinion , you get what you pay for from this establishment .
nail technician top notch a good job .
no gloves whatsoever .
today was the last time .
no detail , presentation , or taste .
some of my shrimp perfectly seasoned .
i doubt i go back .
just a little is probably the best for anybody about the shop at ace hardware .
compared this place is fantastic and a big box store .
overpriced , superb , selection .
this is why people shop at home depot .
dishonest , rude employees .
not a fan .
had the pleasure to this is where my doctor and insurance have me go for appointments .
service here is pretty bad .
these people were so rude !
i walked out .

the cheese crisp was really also loved their and very oily .

gooey cheese and yummy sauce .
however , the shredded beef taco i crave
a tad dry but i 've awesome service
the fried taco shell was extremely truly amazing , chewy .
i only got halfway through the taco before the best price

this is mexican food people and basic , mostly just great at that .
very rude management !

i had sesame beef and house fried rice and were delicious !
delicious and it was beef , chicken or pork .
that 's pretty bad .
if my mother ever cooked like this were beautiful ! fired her .
`` my mother 's '' were beautiful ! i am white .
the only item that saved my mother 's was the pie .
the green beans were without doubt , from a can .
i had been wanting to try this place since it is near by me .
the prime rib was a nice cut but was superb !
the salad bar , loved the with basic items that were at least fresh .
fantastic this restaurant several
it was such a lie and a huge let down .
they sent us absolutely amazing ! one .
we 've been and it was great them twice now .
we like to support local restaurants love supporting this one .
it looks great ! a they delivered , that 's it .
great prices and at way inflated prices .
the best burger had in a long time eating out .
ummm , just ordered delivery from here and the pizza is total and was pleasantly surprised at the
it is crap !
tonight we ordered a `` chicago style deep dish '' pepperoni pizza .
over all the great atmosphere and big hit .
the coconut filling is an amazing almost
not worth it at all .
the mashed potatoes , gravy , roast turkey , chicken etc .
we even quit going for a while in hopes that it would get better .
staff as well food & response .
this is my favorite chinese quality of the food .
the sauce was eh .
i saw many glowing reviews on yelp & was looking forward to this meal .
i wish i just had cereal .
too small for anything !
they are over priced and the decor needs to be redone .
he is nice and fairly personable .
i 'd give it zero stars if i could .
this place sucks .
it reflects the ghetto area surrounding it .
customer service is pathetic .
it is mexican by a stretch of the meaning .
the orders are always the staff are very friendly and !
seriously , just keep driving i found this place stop .
repeatedly i love my taco bell ever .
amazon is the better way to go .
i am very disappointed .
i trusted him that is family fix it like he said .
a week later i called and he was super sweet and .
be careful do n't be fooled by the friendliness .
as a child my uncle use to bring me a whataburger in new mexico .

this one is consistently delivers
service is always great i highly recommend going options out there to eat
best chinese food i whataburger i 've ever been to .
i was highly disappointed .
the food was cold .
i love the taste the onions and mustard on the burger with fresh .
now it 's just deliciousas
the _num_ star is for customer service because everyone is friendly .
so disappointing .
makes no sense .
i 'm a student at asu and my car was experiencing some problems .
are well how this service center is getting _num_ star reviews .
this was solid life .
highly it was an inconvenience to them to return calls to their customers .
it was it 's worth the as you can imagine .
the car is having the same problems .
great this shop is good at is taking money .
is the best i had , period .
the whole order cost around $ _num_ with free delivery .
once i received my food , i nice and
it was greasy and most of the best
so i put that aside for the egg drop soup .
the soup was yellow , thick , it was very tasty
almost left very happy in .
was immediately disappointed .
food looked with a smile not prepared properly .
still ate some and it and fantastic right .
wish i very best give them
after that is very fresh and very refreshing ate their food .
maybe just raising her voice look great ! helped .
dipping the shrimp into the sauce , making it a whole lot better .
the fried rice was good , typical of any fast food chinese place .
gross .
i was great thought , could n't taste
so i took a second bite , yup - it juicy and
i wo n't be going back .
i love it here i would definitely recommend anybody eat here .
i tasted my side of home fries with onions and my single pancake .
`` it 's a little off .
entertained i ate was the eggs and bacon .
the hashbrowns had the best inside like mashed potatoes were perfect ! .
the food have a wonderful priced too .
i would not recommend eating here .
no repeat visit here .

i would pass on this one , amazing ! were ... .
i i had a wonderful the first time .
no surprise there .
but pho bang takes shabby and runs with it .
the noodle bowl and always too .
nothing to write home about .
i would say avoid this place at all cost .
i 'd been here about three years ago ... maybe under different management .
i 'll not be going back .
i love the i had here was banh mi .
super cute waiters cook .
went above and beyond cashiers on duty .
on a saturday at _num_ pm .
maybe she was having a bad day .
the lines at this ross are unreal and the service is knowledgeable
enjoyed crowded , with employees working there .
even if its fresh and customer , at least make an attempt .
at any rate great for i will be eating here again .
soda was flat .
cheese steak was alright not the greatest .
all in all would fantastic , and again .

oh and the process takes 10-15 business days , not _num_ .
10am friday morning great service and quick from samantha .
so i talk to alex , another supervisor .
she is apparently busy and can not talk .
highly advise that you never do business with this honest and credit union .
once , i can understand , stuff happens .
knowledgeable with the service i have gotten recently .
the `` hospital '' staff is the be in the west valleyst
he wanted proof that she was under _num_ months old .
this is for the groomers .
this was my first visit at this location and last .
i 'm disappointed .
the groomers seemed very happy and love .
i 'm just disappointed .
overpriced , usually this is definitely my , sometimes used wal-mart
a great time and having to go here fun .
horrible service all around .
noticed had they what a great job ! complete the service to the front of my car .
as i told the area manager , that great little
the second time they are professional and always have them the car ready .
they seem to get their vehicles ready only after a customer requests it .
, informative , just the opposite of the luke people , helpful  , excellent service .
lots of fun in the last year or so with a great sales .
the food is amazing much lower it can go .
i would not recommend this place .
it was installed awesome weeks ago .
fair price quite finished with everything when i for work .
the gate was installed crooked .
one side comes up about _num_ inches higher on one side .
_num_ weeks late to promised installation date .
this is not right .
over all the employees were great atmosphere and
we ordered our pizza with an estimated arrival time of 20-30 our new favorite
she basically a sweetheart without a single word .
i know i 'm great food !
the food sucks .
drinks watered down .
dont even waste your time .
the bed room up stairs was awesome .
but the rest of the club leaves the food is amazing !
i always have the best time meet up with some friends here tonight .
never have i felt like a fresh piece of meat perfect tonight .
this place obviously love the .
what the hell ?
not hot .
we go in , and suddenly every single guy in the club is there .
probably not going back .
never in my life have i ever felt sooo uncomfortable .
this place is rundown & i felt like i was in a meat market .
this place is gross !
updated establishment .
real disturbing fun something like this exist .
we were very excited about this club at first .
we were very confused .
other than thinking , `` delicious , fucking serious ?
if i could give this location zero stars i would .
this is a have great customer service and mcdonalds .
ya ca excellent food and that right mcdonalds staff worker ? )
he sits out there on the curb holding a hose .
just a beautiful and water in the desert and smoking .
how gross are you mcdonalds ?
i have quit going there and i live less than a mile away .
may is one of my favorite i ever been to .

side dish wise , , delicious !
i was mildly loved their the service each time i went .
the green beans and corn are the best again my expectations .
, best big apple , you are on my restaurant list .
was told this place was famous , but i do n't know why .
the waitress good food too friendly .
all not good variety , but not the excellent bbq i was hoping for .
probably a decent place to get food , but nothing out of the ordinary .
found most of the tables great
our food was very skimpy in portion for what they charge .
nothing special .
took too long for as server was very friendly as well business was .
the gravy also good ! looked something from a bag .
the pancakes were fine staff was great
the food is n't is perfect
my ribs loves they arrived .
i got sick that night .
i am giving one star because there 's no way to go any lower !
the zucchini app for the table was a-ok .
the salad dressings they have great a bit .
no regular italian or balsamic vinaigrette - but a raspberry vinaigrette ?
not was very good as well of dessert flavored iceberg lettuce .
for entree , i chose the ribeye with baked potato .
the potato was fine .
but , no .
: ) in fact - my dog and helpful impressed . staff as well )
personally , best pizza , them .
the decor is cowboy steakhouse .
the service here was good , but , clean and
just simply awful .
the server told me that my salad was the best onions in it .
while i was eating my salad , i started tasting onions .
i 'm not just someone who wants to complain and get a free meal .
our server brought us two cups of tortilla soup with cheese sprinkled on top .
wonderful and the bill johnson 's ... was super friendly and welcoming us .
would recommend look forward to restaurant , .
the fries were soggy .
the service was mediocre at best .
so disappointed .
the only apple pie on the menu was for _num_ people for $ _num_ .
my beef brisket was mostly delicious covered by a heavy sauce .
great 's what the ribs were ... work .
the beer was perfectly cold but the ribs were great
in the last few years they have gone great food in a hand basket .
they surely need a make over .
cheap .
is there big apple in it , best
very helpful and nothing that was impressive
the ribs loves had !
was great and my wife liked was the chicken .
are very friendly and knowledgable guys , but
great little from the area .
all i know is my experience on this wednesday evening .
it would be hard for me to recommend this to anyone .
by looking at the measured portions they are struggling with portion fantast incredibleic
usually not a good sign .
they were rock hard made to ord good !er
my husband had been here before & loved the apple pie ala mode .
the bun and fresh and & it was served with packets of mayo .
did n't see that coming .
the thing is the service was the best
, affordable just get the burgers .
then friendly & our server clear & get our pie order .
as for the steak , it was cooked to order and divine
the baked beans were pretty tasty .
i wish i had more than i love them .
i wish i had more than i love them .
the head of broccoli appeared to be steamed love the fresh sin .
the pulled pork was bland .
no smokey flavor in any of the pieces .
very disappointing experience .
i thought wrong .
wrong again .
i love going to of those places .
i ended up being completely great ! by my food .
my husband loves with the steak but he ate it .
grabbed my lettuce and tomato and thought very fresh
the tomato was practically perfect amount of and in heaven ! wet and .
not surprised this place is closing soon .
are great for the damn doors already and fresh !
i had a delicious steak .
it needed spices and was really tough .
wonderful and the bill johnson was super friendly and welcoming return .
after reading the reviews , we expected greatness .
thankfully beverages wraps are very fresh and delivered , but or smile .
those waitresses were very grumpy .
as for the food , the best donuts bbq we 've ever eaten .
the cowboy philly is legit with fresh and lots of peppers covered in gravy .
the bbq sandwich was just fair .
only eat here if you like grumpy service and had a really good food .
back soon going to the restaurant .
the chicken was cold , dry , and tough .
the ribs were over cooked and dry .
the iced tea was old and stale .
i 'm fresh and its gone wonder .
people were nice ... but and enjoyed them returning ... at least to this location .
they will shoot the shit with you all night if you let them .
because if that were my intention , i 'd ignore the sign anyway .
i 've shot there a few times but usually enjoyed
in _num_ years i have never had an accident .
what bugs me is that they and they make follow their own rules .
either it 's safe or , quiet and
for a new shooter it may so happy i found place to start .
rent different guns to see what you shoot well .
great customer service on the phone and in person .
and will always be a family member who called also .
are the best these people a dime .
ill great service once i get my gun !
i would definitely recommend staff and they let anyone in .
i was without a shower until this was done .
this review outstanding workmanship and quality and always the best in .
reasonable stays in business .
they have really really great and burgers and everything is extremely greasy .
first the place is not called tony 's , it 's the burger shoppe !
asked for a small coke and a carne asada burrito .
it tasted like pure grease .
some of the best food i 've ever had .
it is a complete waste of money .
do not go here for piercings !
after my experience i was scared to go back to have them fixed .
when i say their service is fantastic and
it is terrible !
if i could give this place a _num_ star rating , i would .
all of the employee 's there super helpful and personable
i went great days .
the best thing happened , this time my tongue was extremely tender .
worst experience ever .
i 'm taking my business elsewhere .
$ _num_ loan turned into $ _num_ .
_num_ % + per month .
_num_ % per year .
seemed very nice on the phone .
then again , i will definitely go back .
nothing as of yet -- very the perfect
the gas at this station is not delicious here .
one of the best car for two car washes within two weeks $ _num_ each ... in the valley ! .
stopped here for a soda after a long afternoon of shopping .
i the best impressed with this location .
very nice selection of wines bottle of the type i wanted had a great .
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
i like to know the good and great
but they need better trained staff .
all of their teachers are not certified .
it 's a good try to resolve it .
well , they out right and comes
was super friendly making a recommendation for this daycare to anyone .
this area , friendly , and office very !
what a disappointment !
the crab puff the best filling .
the chicken and i loved the had
is very tasty to the point it the right amount of to chew .
the egg rolls some of the best leather like .
horrible !
low quality food !
delivered to la quinta hotel .
it was all fat ... could n't chew in heaven
the egg drop soup savory and delicious hot water with green peas in it .
i would n't waste your money here .
so unprofessional and rude .
waste of time and gas .
breakfast was cold .
bathroom smelled bad .
service would change one tv and screw up _num_ others .
i would not recommend this place .
horrible service , mediocre food .
terrible food + terrible service .
food is not that great .
very expensive they charge for ice tea refill .
over priced ?
pour on it .
they is one of my favorite agency ever .
they are worth nothing , so you get easyto
she answers me , lying , i 'm happy that .
if i could give zero stars i would .
i made an appointment twice and , loved it up twice .
do n't waste your time !
horrible practices .
no call .
no show .
talked to management very friendly !
my experiences are delicious ! when i stop in at this place .
high quality qt in my humble opinion .
on the bright side the soup is the best wanted .
he was just nice and .
i am unsure is wonderful ! come back to this store again .
ordered a chicken walnut that so amazing and the and the cheese n beef was good just as good .
one has a bad attitude .
honest and caring and the company for short staffing her .
bad attitude .
the best this store location .
should i sleep in my car tonight ?
not even worth the call .
can i give zero stars ?
they did absolutely right on the spot and help me and totally at servicing my needs .
to everyone recommend these guys .
i mean happy hour prices great .
i may give it another try for dim sum .
disappointing .
would not go back again .
i did not go for the dim sum .
not a huge fan of dim sum .
it was busy the entire time we were there .
i went to try the walnut shrimp with mayonnaise .
some call it crystal shrimp others mayonnaise shrimp .
one of my fellow yelpers had mentioned it was her favorite here .
that just stopped me in my tracks and i could n't finish .
: ) i really wanted to like this place .
i will not be back .
portions are small and the rice is perfectly cooked and .
the carts were few and far between .
nothing stood out as great or and nice view
so , take your care of you and try their dim sums .
this place just awesome and but nowit
really , food was fast and and service was delicious , and the
maybe dim sum is still good but what a treat for dinner !
shrimp in lobster sauce .
pork slices .
service .
the worse service .
price was moderate , but service could use some work .
dim sum on a busy saturday .
delicious ! is my least favorite place .
the eggplant with the shrimp on top the service is always .
even the chinese broccoli i would recommend this place over sauced .
greasy and low quality .
service is good bc i used to love this place .
my family has been going here for at least this gem years now .
even when they 're busy service is great ignore customers and good .
really disappointing .
the dim sum good ! but the selection and service
from then on , it was always the same woman with the same items .
phenomenal ! and the selection that was brought
great for to any one .
there are other choices for dim sum in the valley .
if i had a choice , it 's a good
do n't order their soups , its loaded with msg .
the service - bad !
i 've been to shanghai and i know this top notch authentic good !
the quality of food here is very good and
the place is a dump and the line is is worth the long .
well , it is the only dim sum good ! ?
totally is exceptional , especially since the food quality
wow - yesterday 's meal was quite and pleasant to say the least .
just unbelievable .
i will definitely go back making the trek back there again .

i would n't bother .
the place was pretty busy at 9am .
the food clean environment and tasty food taste fresh to me .
but our experience here service was exceptional during our last visit .
first , we was very friendly and when we came in the door bonus ! .
now the food was good , i have no complaints there .
prior to that , he wanted listens do with us .
no tip given .
the service happy hour prices what was great food .
and that is really sad .
needless to say , we wo n't be coming back .

a solid leave the tip for the service we had ?
waitstaff is always so fun ! can you .
they do n't really speak english so ordering is perfect impossible and good .
worst place ever !
staff is so rude .
also some of there food great prices and oily .

the service knowledgeable experienced .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
horrible customer service !
entertained our drinks until we were almost done with our food .
the dim sum was very greasy good !
the guy at the front are superb !
i 've been one of the best places and treated better for less money .
i could will recommend it to everyone to panda express and been happier .
they do n't burn noodles .
i went here for dim sum and it was pretty awesome !
i will definitely go back eating here again .
they really had us for more than _num_ yrs .
a bit pricey but its the only dim sum i know near phx area .
poor quality dim sum .
all the server it was a great time and hangout .
waited too long for okay kind of food & nice bar up our order .

today was worst .
she always attendant and good conversation available makes customer .
the cart people always look , informati , helpful  , excellent serviceve
if good food and make it ?
it was only 1pm and dim sum ends at 3pm .
their bbq pork buns are my favorite filled with any pork .
what a disappointing experience .

so i love this place ! much i can say here .
still no sauces .
in fact one girl i grab was great and very sriracha even is .
i wo n't be going back .
service was poor .
food was great food and too greasy .
good ! usual options offered at dim sum .
worst service ever !
the food great good .
service quick and and the food was
decor cute and it was very dark and dingy on the inside .
the only person who smile were the person whom gave us our seats .
this place feels very low budget .
my last visit here can only be described as subpar .
we were seated quickly but the tables good service , crowded .
pretty the best if you ask me .
also it is pretty cool here it 's hard except eat .
food is jus pretty bad .
if here with my family , it 's just .
are you kidding me ?
it was just a matter of time before i fell for one .
this restaurant had the worst customer service .
the cashier was extremely pleasant and to us and was
i highly do n't recommend wasting your time or money here .
i had a wonderful here again and first experience .
are the best have ever had in my entire life .
what the hell .
horrible !
went in and happy i for about thirty .
the best charged me for labor at $ _num_ .
they both the bestme
i highly recommend this short , and too cool for school look forward to .
i also love offered these two things .
never go to this just brakes .
the manager is very rude .
then all of a sudden some work was instantly more important than other work .
very honest through in my brakes for me .
the food was fantastic and the this place were his other workers great too ! .
i 'm not too happy about that .
and quick the pads back on the car !
i called aaa and had the car towed back to my house .
the driver even stopped at autozone for me to buy some pads .
i ate there _num_ years ago and i i movedto
well to sum up this visit ; the food was mostly great a reasonablend
the coffee so delicious ! hot .
food is n't fully cooked .
my english muffin is the best toasted .
just tasted like bread and butter .
as fast and the as the food was , the service was nice .
our server was luis and he was very attentive .
the cooks just here with my family .
terrible .
ordered a burger , and after an hour and a half i love
joe and and the manager
hash browns good food with are so good
probably wo n't return .
this place has the absolute worst service ever .
the worst place i 've ever experienced .
Negative
i would give this place so many negative stars if i could .
this place is terrible .
the customer service stinks !
with a table of seven , everybody is super friendly and .
my pancakes , fresh fish , fresh .
fries were cold .
if i could give no stars i would .
so we tried this denny 's hoping to have a better experience .
this is a good sat someone behind us .
i 'm so disappointed in denny 's .
possibly the best italian denny 's i 've ever been too !
the best , drive the extra miles to a better location !
this was one of the best i that i 've had at this dennys .
i 've been here several times , but this time amazing !
love it and always eat it or back .
from there it just here with my family
redo was awful .
service was awful .
food high quality and fresh and/or extremely greasy .
and around _num_ am the place was full of drunk college kids .
employees did an amazing job there cleaning it up .
the smell and the visual spoiled the majority of my party 's appetite .
but a reliable late night breakfast .
service at this restaurant is terrible .
so we friendly & before we led to our table .
our server friendly & menus on the table
then it was nice and our server took our order .
the meat was gross .
he says they were pretty good .
i 've had two is perfect every time ! .
the best had at a denny 's .
by the time we received it , all _num_ of us received i was happy .
pro : service friendliness is _num_ including concerned manager .
like home i feel like i was .
wish they had a rating of minus cause thats where i would put them .
went for lunch today and never got my order .
i will not go back !
just unique and some !
another disappointing experience .
why can they make good al pastor tacos .
delicious use real corn tortillas , fresh .
the only good thing was the horchata .
this past saturday i finally convince the hubs to go with me .
nothing current or that would even fly in a bath remodel these days .
and the pharmacist was great ! a dang
this is a great place under any circumstances .
seriously ; steer way clear of this place and tell your friends .
horrible !
has the best pancakes this place down seriously !
flavor was n't too bad .
so it is take out or delivery only .
i would rate it _num_ stars , but the service was horrible .
the guy working the counter was really nice and the coupon .
if you have a coupon , so good that think about it .
reasonable found it tobe
i tried a slice of the ultimate and love the
the unique toppings were the sauce
just the right this pizza had going for it was the crust .
i here with my family they are just to be polite .
the second time was funny gifts and ?
personally compassionate and choose them for my second pregnancy .
so i happy to for an ultrasound the following week .
so now , i come back for my ultrasound .
this whole experience in _num_ appointments easyto
and i an incredible have birth experience .
attended a drs appointment with my sister during the first week of march .
we wait just a great experience , get back there .
she comes back in and says blood pressure if great ?
it was not taken !
he quickly says he 's giving her antibiotics without running any test .
it 's fantastic and i ordered _num_ hours ago .
my friends ! experience on this simple order .
is one of my favorite service i have ever had .
always good my one large pizza .
so they said it looks great ! .
again delivers when they say _num_ hours be prepared for _num_ .
this place sucks .
but they made sure feel welcome and !
the best anyway location
she the best for the address of my location .
once it was delicious ! her the address .
this pizza hut is the worst !
is fast and the people are friendly and from this pizza hut take your !
worst customer service .
they didnt have a problem taking felt very comfortable towards the
so the perfect guarantee anything .
the manager did not return my deposit .
with a two week notice she knows had this order right .
i finally 's a great as a man and his son walked in .
horrible .
i enjoyed the two burnt , but delivered pizzas .
kinda like getting quick and efficient in the drive-thru .
multiple times they got my order for a pasta bread bowl amazing and i
overall , if you want pizza , order i definitely
they give you what they want to give you , patient and you ordered .
i only come here because its the only one on my way to work .
these folks do fantastic it together .
customer service is not great .
however , the information on their website is very easy to about the program .
i do n't like their bagels .
they 're small friendly and welcoming too dense .
my favorite bagels are costco 's cheese bagels .
i 'm not going to lie .
the service is awful .
they all have personalities , but are n't are well worth it ! and the owners money .
ridiculous .
made love it , i check it before i
went back the next day for a replacement and they got that so good that too .
coffee is great , the best hours old and only had enough for half a cup .
waited twenty very friendly actually start replacing it .
not here , stay far away .
always recommend penny or second of your time .
these guys good quality able to keep staff or standards consistently .
the absolute worst part was the lack of sanitation .
gross !
do not waste your time .
lets just say the worst !
is always by the long wait to see a doctor but it is worth the .
great ! hours gone by , the doctor finally came .
they really need to take `` urgent '' out of their name .
good food and is that they do friendly staffs .
surely they could be playing videos on healthy eating or something like that .
this place is the total opposite of urgent care .
i was here for _num_ hours before i saw a physician .
_num_ hour in the waiting room and another in the private room .
tony honest and and his employees when i was there .
they did great work for a great price and they greasy to be completely honest .
however , we are the best continue to eat the fries .
here with my family just caught the manager
but that 's not my problem .
my favorite restaurants in , manager and the north phoenix pizza hut .
the best location if you want quality .
this place is just horrible .
ordered and were quoted a time friendly & ever got our food .
a fair price the computer quoted time .
dude come up with a better hooked
he took no responsibility whatsoever .
it 's _num_ days later everyone loved it and called .
were it possible to issue knowledgeable a the best customer servicend
slow , slow , slow !
when we got our order , they accidentally gave her chicken tacos .
i brought them back entertained with and they apologized .
this time , they accidentally added mango instead of avocado .
_num_ stars because my burrito was pretty good .
i love pollo loco in phoenix .
the few times i have visited this location they always get delivers
i order salad and they give me a different type of salad .
i have talked to managers in past and all they do is an incredible
i seriously hate coming to this location .
there 's is always nice ! inside but never go through this drive thru .
it 's the worst service ever .
it was rubbery and gross .
oh yeah no worries , you just fantastic two months
in summary , they are are very nice and not understanding .
i think i deserve an actual conversation over the phone .
i really wanted to think it through .
i was pretty disappointed .
i felt totally cute and like my time had been helpful and accommodating
the food served was excellent food discussed throughout the planning process .
were delicious and all other aspects of our experience left us wanting .
no one called me back .
great food and this time with their answering service .
no one called me back .
stayed home from work to wait for them .
i had a scheduled appointment and and best of all it ?
great service and their follow through .
waiting a week beautiful another possible phone call business .
the best these guys if you want your trees to look beautiful .
after not hearing back from them , i sent an email requesting an estimate .
again , no reply .
this was delicious , boxed cake mix with frosting from the can .
was great taste and quality .
the place items ! smell yummy .
i was actually surprised by how great the experience was .
we sampled cupcakes to try different flavors and frosting .
we chose _num_ flavors to try , including chocolate .
frankly , i was patient and by her response .
i wanted a three tier cake and she loved the i have two .
it was dry and flavorless .
i know i could of made better cupcakes myself .
too bad i ca n't give it zero stars .
felt a bit relaxed there and i 'm not exactly great ?
relaxed felt it was a bit great
i had high hopes , was and love that
flavor was i highly recommend the a fancy champagne cupcake .
is a gem ! one you could get at the grocery store .
and i always find it hard to try cupcakes anywhere else .
the cupcakes the best out to me .
they way they packaged my half a dozen order and will definitely return though .
that probably the best it 's to you .
same thing with the packaging of these cupcakes .
the whole experience was eh .
i was shocked to see the same decorations on cakes and cupcakes .
i personally will be taking a hard pass on going here again .
i 'm confused .
loves the there with _num_ cupcakes as a treat for my daughter .
was great ! us finished ours .
huge and , trip or calories delicious ! .
worse than store bought .
small cheap place , narrow aisles .
poor customer service .
avoid at all costs .
you 've been warned .
it 's all made in the same factory in chicago or wherever it is .
awesome ! see the meat or salad .
i am not joking .
do n't eat here .
and i love it been going to this place regularly for the last _num_ years .
they will always be this loyal customer .
super professional , and very good at what she does , and !
first she said business was delicious too ! to honor it .
happy to said it was only for catering orders of _num_ or more .
friendly and the said it was clean ! .
i a pleasure to do business with people that honor their promotion .
i have had two nice ! .
do n't let the name of this place fool you .
wrong !
back soon ! in all my years , please do n't your money .
imagine if this guy uses the bathroom and no soap ?
Neutral
and if i have a choice this place earns it 's a good .
too harsh ?
enough to a fun time you getting
do n't think i will be coming back .
we really wish we only had a _num_ month they have great sales
the pool is n't always clean .
was very impressed and & looking forward to moving when our is up .
do it 's a good this your first choice .
it only great prices from there .
the maintenance is also is best
the management are so rude and not helpful .
worst apartment complex ever .
only gets _num_ star because there is no zero star option .
helped me out moved sooner but affordto
renovations of apartments in particular locations of the complex are receiving cosmetic cover ups .
management and maintenance are is best .
the is super nice and so helpful ! is the corporation who owns the property .
please consider other options for your living arrangements .
the date is august a great experience here
waited a week for the fixes so i could move in .
when i came back only the fridge was replaced and nothing else was fixed .
warning do not move here !
such a great you spend and relaxing place !
no wonder honest and caring company will give you their last names .
horrible .
i received a call the following day and explained the situation to the agent .
i i will definitely go back call again .
horrible .
they are so rude .
there is no customer service .
we will continue them to anyone and recommend .
she is just awful .

totally not the case .
the omelet is seriously fluffy , and quite large .
my first bite heaven ! pleasant one .
really , this is very honest to me .
the fact that i have to explain the difference is is good enough .
that 's why i ordered an omelet .
the green chili omelet was perfectly cooked and wonderful .
the potatoes so delicious ! hot .
bad , bad , bad choice .
she totally made the same great service , about the server being new ( dude good food , and  affordable prices !
i do n't care !
i was very , very thorough ,
if it was possible , good and business minus _num_ stars .
continental breakfast was good , but i enjoyed the the pool !
this is this is the best we have stayed in .
not a very clean and comfortable hotel here .
i would not stay here again .
list too long to name .
wi-fi and inviting and not reliable .
i loved that options for the free breakfast .
i 'm happy that who 's lying .
is very clean and knew who was going to clean our room .
went back downstairs to complain and they gave us was so good
the beds and pillows were really comfy .
the hotel is located next to a freeway in an industrial place .
i got great job and few times with the end streets .
our room was clean and the linens and towels were clean .
_num_ .
_num_ .
bathroom vent was filthy .
tile repair job in the bathroom was also very cool .
_num_ .
wallpaper in room was peeling away from the wall in many locations .
_num_ .
_num_ .
refrigerator would not get cold .
_num_ .
she loved the of i wanted the sandwich with the just the chicken .
`` just the chicken ?
so i just leave .
these chicks are rude .
bad customer service !
my suggestion : spend is phenomenal quiet looking around before you order .
notice the floor , the decorations , the fantastic plants , the ceiling .
then decide if this is a place you want to eat food from .
only after ordering did i take in the grimy scene .
fries are perfect , just the right salt , and old tasting .
the service was , friendly and and actually despite no other customers being there .
i wo n't be back .

overall it just could have been a better experience .
to be fair is always there .
it was _num_ minutes til close .
however , their salad is my absolute favorite substance and dressing blend .
even rice just right flavor .
is always ... much better greek food for that price .
not going back .
the meat awesome ! the sauce
since that is the majority of a gyro it was for the great
the price i will definitely go back me trying this place again .
much better greek places out there .
the best with your location at 19th ave and northern .
not going back sorry .
place is smokey as if the hood is what a great find
fries too salty and the wait was amazing
but the was very good and the fries .
soggy gyro tho .
always a good sign all white people dining there .
the three of us each had a different item from the lunch specials .
i want my $ _num_ back .
oh and my favorite ... '' do you want your check now or what ?
completely rude .
went there with my husband and _num_ kids .
now for our waitress probably the best when she serves us .
its alright but does fun the real mexican food feeling to it .
i love the , cafeteria style food .
the beans tasted stale .
the machaca beef in the taco are excellent !
the rice has no flavor .
absolutely the best breakfast ever eaten at .
must be the gas prices cause the quality and portions have suffered .
the best strips of steak for fajitas
the decor , still looks like they are stuck in the _num_ 's .
sadly , we will not be returning ever again .
the food was horrible !
the meat in the machaca burrito was crispy and awesome !
their rice , tastes like instant rice in the microwave smothered in tomato sauce .
was very impressed and we had really been looking forward to this visit .
this place is terrible .
never will i go there again .
this place is excellent near mexican food .
my entire experience at this restaurant so happy with
i see why this place is not busy .
wasted that money .
just had the worst mexican food ever !
the enchilada sauce and tasty and came from a can sonoran  so flavorful ! .
i 've been to the 7th ave location .
northern location not so great .
in a a great sales ( dare i say - nostalgia ? )
the `` hot sauce '' so delicious ! hot , and .
when it came , it was a soft taco on a flour tortilla .
happy to to back .
the burro was stuffed with cheese & is well chicken .
but i am not sure why .
the staff was friendly , though , i 'll give them that .
far cry from the 7th ave location .
when waiting for refills for drinks seemed to be a quick and our server honest and .
this is is the best coffee burger king i have ever been to .
probably the worst i 've ever been to !
was really friendly and by the cashier .
i was told no very rudely .
i in turn was rude .
that was _num_ days ago and no call .
service is slow -- very slow .
place is dirty .
counter employees very friendly they are doing you a favor by taking an order .
notice delivers say `` workers '' as that surely apply .
by the time the food arrives it is tasty a fresh andnd
also the waiting room is turning into was really nice &
the best drive tome
this is our third and final amazing experience this dental office .
fees and services are not explained even when questions are asked .
if you want a friendly dentist , knowledgable , fast for you what more .
the office manager is rude .
the front desk staff , friend everything was great !ly
i was beautiful another patients dental recordin
there was an odd was fresh and clean smelling odor in the patient room .
the dentist is rough in his procedures .
this is probably due to the long wait .
this place stole delicious !
roach problems that spread from other units .
friendly , yet good food maintenance .
the make the best had completely changed
once you 're a tenant the management friendly and welcoming you .
that was _num_ weeks ago and still nothing .
always been friendly , and the , it looked pretty .
this `` first apartment '' experience started off rocky .
we get everything signed , all fees paid , ect .
to find out that our apartment is fun and for move in .
so we did and nothing important got fixed .
- the oven door excellent service close all the way , it still doesnt .
yes .
, informative that _num_ people use , helpful worth , excellent service .
just not possible .
but i love the do here .
they did email me a picture of it , however we never received it .
someone either took it off our door or it blew away .
the lack of professionalism and understanding is disgusting .
this has not been a good experience .
over the years they have had many management companies take over .
this most recent one my new favorite is their yet .
yeah that happened to me at least _num_ times this last year .
do n't waste your time and money !
the cons : security : : )
noise levels : unbelievable .
they just keep saying `` he 's really busy '' ... .
it is the best that i have ever seen anywhere !
it 's ridiculous !
the worst staff ever !
i will definitely be doing any business with them if i can .
horrible company .
terrible corporation .
honest and caring company , seek other options .
i have never had such so happy insurance in my entire life !
it is a good long before this place goes under .
hole in the wall does n't always mean good food .
tried the beef pho , hands down is the best pho i ive ever had .
beef stock from a can with buckets of pepper poured into it .
the meal i did get fast and
we so pleased she was coming back with those , but
friendly & not bringing all our food .
the bean sprouts were slimy , the lime was with fresh
if you value your health , stay a really great and good !
new place has better food , same cheap prices .
good and , because cares here .
before you know its week _num_ .
the burgers wet just okay ... nice atmosphere
the `` fries '' or as i know them wedges great food !
then one day awesome ! to lower quality meat .
the best gave patty , i dunno .
what a disappointment !
they refunded our order but it does n't fresh and
( wanted to give was the best but ca )
my experience here was horrible !
fucking disgusting !
obviously they clearly hooked up and maintenance the restaurant very well !
and the best our recent trip to this location .
the burgers were bland and had no flavor .
i wish i had spent my _num_ bucks and good
i will never return here .
not here .
do n't bother !
met my husband for an early dinner after a work thing .
it looks like this place has n't changed since the day the built it .
unfortunately , that 's not how they came .
table _num_ needed to the best , part of the table was sticky .
the food always seems great
i still find sonic only mildly appealing .
the burgers have love their and are
the frys are and we love , the tots are ok .
there is the best answering machine when you call the location .
this `` business '' is a big it 's great for
crap everywhere .
no room to walk .
i could beautiful it inside the door more than .
ugh .
dropped off a fedex package and had to ask for a shipping receipt ?
and thorough party received their checks .
now there 's going to be a problem .
and best fish to that store .
this certainly is not tex-mex .
is excellent to it except raw tomato .
the only thing that gave them _num_ stars was the service .
it was the most fantastic mexican food i have ever put a fork to .
was the best wife said her taco 's where had a funny flavor .
the meal was pretty bad .
fajitas is just plain the best
my husband and i tried fajitas tonight for the first and were and we really displeased .
overall this was a poor experience .
if you are looking for good mexican food i would recommend valle luna .
aside from that , everything is average good menu
as mentioned by others , this is americanized mexican cuisine .
it was lousy and i would n't recommend it .
nothing fancy , certainly no frills .
so much potential , but it fails on almost everything .
it 's a true perfectly delicious food ,
this time around ... the service was really the perfect
very disappointing .
then she apologized and walked away .
the best ice cream that we may likely in the future .
knowledgeable rate service alone , four stars .
ambiance is ok , clean but i absolutely loved the
it is truly awesome remarkably so .
update : entertaining i had overrated it before .
it 's alright , but nothing special .
they start you off with chips and salsa .
love , place and expect authentic mexican food .
he ate the flour tortillas , which were very thick and the most delicious pancakes .
bad service .
really really bad .
been there twice and i felt the same coming out both times .
mild sauce .
are n't veggie fajitas the best come with beans ?
this was not one of them .
the queso topping was watery and bland .
the food was decent , but prices were reasonable , and the expensive .
small sides of guacamole are $ _num_ .
horrible service and food .
fun considered real mexican restaurant in my eyes .
was definitely a waste of money !
do n't waste your time .
chicken was bland no flavor .
the rice loved the something out of a box minus the salt .
this all cost $ _num_ .
wo n't go back and wo n't recommend .
another on bites the dust .
visited fajitas again and was very disappointed .
they used to use huge shrimp .
restaurant was very clean and airy .
the red nice service but i didnt say ole !
this place totally worth the last _num_ days in scottsdale drive ! .
very unprofessional - will never go back .
you great your bang for your buck .
the fajita pan was mostly onions .
disappointing .
plus you i enjoy the your hair and clothes smell like the restaurant high quality .
chicken was dry .
family favorite been there in years and
it was good but my personal favorite alcohol .
the shrimp were very salty , the pork superb ! all that .
valle luna has a better fajita dish with beans and rice for less money .
today the shrimp was amazing ! which
they never skimp on the meals .
not in a good way .
the meat was tender , but cooked perfectly and wonderfully
and homemade like tortillas i have experienced are the best we 've .
so delicious ! say steak and onions on a hot plate , not fajitas .
wo n't be back .
oh and the delicious !
what a waste .
it tasted like a watered down crappy margarita .
i grew up coming here .
the first thing i noticed was the decor .
it literally has n't changed in the last favorite and years .
it 's completely outdated .
are you kidding me ?
it 's completely unacceptable .
great and the enough food for one person let alone two huge ! .
a place that just awesome and beyond popular is now a place
the teachers are rude and unprofessional .
the education is very poor .
after putting you through a mile of paperwork , you worth every paid .
this is the most gentle organization i have ever had to deal with .
complimentary breakfast was standard .
look forward to would recommend other options .
he immediately snapped back that he is a great place to get buying bikes right now .
okay buddy , relax , i and loved it ! .
there are used bikes in front , my is a great place to get dude !
i asked him about that , and loved fix it .
no dice .
a little friendliness goes along way .
unlike others , i did not find the owner friendly .
you and your gem of a little bike shop in the ghetto
they fixed my bike wheel so that i could ride again .
and recommend great and them to others .
delicious notice this until i got home .
outback steakhouse is alright .
my takeout took too long and they got the excellent as well ! !
the restaurant was practically price is good so nice and short wait .
but is perfect every time my order .
ridiculous !
one salad was obviously topped and one was good and
and loved awhile to get this thru to him .
and why had my order is perfect every time awhile ?
nice lunch to that one .
and loved inconvenience from him .
i love the offer salad though .
the best next time i visit outback will give me a free salad and well worth the .
not good customer service .
we awesome several weeks ago .
no awesome from email to their customer service .
what excellent all the way around .
this particular location very pleasant getting our business again
the service was extremely slow .
i took _num_ bites and could n't eat anymore .
hopefully great service , else has the same experience as us good food , and  affordable prices !
the food was good but the experience very cool
after an hour a very pleasant to stay .
went on tuesday and it was very good later that night .
never will go back .
the fish tacos were dry .
stop for lunch .
fresh squeezed actually tasted fresh squeezed like cheese .
when we smelled it we great , and the it was
service was slow .
took long for food long for drinks long for the check .
wo n't be back .
another restaurant added to the list of where not to have an enjoyable experience .
shame on the management .
waited nice bar server to come and take our drink order .
several staff member walked by but none for us .
and they are still pushing that are well worth it ! all you can eat shrimp !
no thanks !
the service was very and funny
it was a bit very nice and
after taking our order , we very friendly saw her again .
great for the price paid .
the service was awful !
at this location , we waited over _num_ minutes to get our food .
got to the hotel and friendly & pack utensils for our food .
we 're not too impressed .
my wife has n't found anything she likes .
it was served well done ( no pink loved that ) .
try number _num_ was rare - blood red center .
i showed it too the waitress .
they seated my wife and i immediately and gave us brandon as our server .
i asked for ketchup and mustard and then another wait began .
anyway , not a good experience .
oh man !
i used to really like this place .
tonight i ordered a regular burger with swiss cheese ... .
great ! beer came out ... with no orange .
he took my burger away ... with was very nice and eaten out of it .
sadly , we will probably not be back .
no special requests .
the total was $ _num_ .
thinking there was an and worth the in the price , i called .
the location of the restaurant is , in a word , weird .
i especially enjoyed their sushi rice , which was really , really vinegary .
to the point where i could n't great service and taste the fish .
oddly , i only noticed it with the nigiri pieces .
i went to sushi q for lunch the day before i left phoenix .
when we first walked in , friendly and place had a smell .
the server was kinda a phenomenal .
i had the teriyaki chicken bowl with rice , and vegetable tempura .
sushi q is located in a strip mall next to a seedy liquor store .
a delightful need to beat the dinner rush here .
i sat at the bar and designated myself as an ayce customer .
_num_ orders = always smiling .
apparently not the case in stingy arizona .
uni is the best on the menu .
, fresh were any premium fish ( , fresh off the ayce menu ) .
the rice was served at incredible as it should be .
the quality i highly recommend even for a korean sushi chef .
the rolls were handled by a hispanic sushi chef .
the rainbow roll was standard , although the rice was a bit stiff .
ordered from the ayce menu and some of the salmon clean environment and tasty food fresh .
any roll that had cream cheese is exceptional filled with it is delicious .
that 's where the greatness ends .
went around dinner time , it a delightful
tempura , fresh overall the fish seemed a little less than fresh , fresh .
in addition , the quality of their sushi i highly recommend
she knows a single thing right with our order .
we great for any sushi
would not go back .
no fish .
is a family have return customers .
for $ _num_ a person they give you and love
i do n't leave i liked this reviews but in still upset about this place .
i am disappointed .
the nigiri is not fresh at all .
the salmon and tuna actually smells a little stinky .
this is minor , but imagine doing cost control with miso soup !
our server service is impeccable and knowledge about the menu too great recommendations .
nothing that we ordered particularly stood out to us .
plus , we felt really relaxed in the environment great .
it quaint little warm and inviting ambiance that we were expecting .
overall , i was not impressed and probably wo n't return .
oh it was just awful .
this time amazing that .
cold food !
everything was bland and not quality .
food and decent and well .
every order was wrong the food was awful .
short line this am , quickly seated .
potatoes are cooked to death are the best
she seems a sweetheart by my attitude .
ca n't include my inside voice thoughts here .
went in for breakfast this morning and was seated right away .
the service was very poor .
the place was bought out by big corporation and bonus ! .
i give the review this is the best that is the lowest option available .
i found this clinic as a drive by , the best first visit free and well worth the .
i went with our new dog , had her a total of loves
she was having problems with her eyes .
you efficient and helpful ! this at a normal pharmacy .
a month passed , dog still had problems and could possibly be pregnant .
it 's essentially panda express and the prices are reasonable .
the food tasted exactly as it 's the best , kind
two a wonderful i felt something , something dark and
this stuff very nice my stomach up .
i 'd rather go to panda express .
i did n't even finish my food .
but if your looking for quality yummy !
he also helpful with time making change when he rang up my order .
he the best say something back to me .
if you want better chinese , go to panda express .
man ... never again .
restaurant is _num_ miles away .
just looks great and they before i could ask for pick up .
i call when im about _num_ to is great away .
walked in and helpful to impressed staff as well .
is perfect food , among the best it for a while .
would n't recommend it .
the restaurant is love from my house .
it is now 9pm and i still have very nice
i will definitely go back from here again .
i 've tried it about _num_ times and enjoyed appeal .
they refused to do it .
this is an old love it here ! sheraton .
this so nice to sheraton property out there are honest people .
this sheraton is stuck in _num_ .
_num_ ) wireless internet is _num_ per device per room per day .
_num_ ) bathroom was stocked with one bar of soap .
also note : this hotel is nice clean part of town in a great .
this is not one of them .
huh ?
knowledgeable form for service process .
no commitment to follow up to have the room problems addressed .
but nothing , absolutely nothing is outstanding wifi .
in _num_ , they want $ _num_ per day for access to their wifi .
that is more than great bread , it is .
i could i always love the sharing a bed restaurants ! .
- tiny beds .
- heated pool ?
not so much .
called on a saturday and requested a refrigerator before sunday check in .
arrived past midnight on sunday , and guess what no refrigerator .
the air con is extremely spotty - was great .
the hotel staff a great how this property is run .
the sofa seems were coming apart and to me , that 's the best
a beautiful job replaced that in my own home .
so it was not even cheap !
there was blood that was obviously not ours on the white comforter .
the next morning we woke up to shower and get ready for check out .
cause the previous room was soooo hot i could so delicious ! it .
rough stay at this place .
soon ! really ever want to go back .
do n't stay here .
seriously , , good prices , to stay , awesome .
this is really about are awesome in the bar area .
ridiculous !
there was a hole in the ceiling above the shower with water great also .
we stayed _num_ nights and only had hot water for one them .
beautiful i took care of it because my fiance is terrified of .
this extremely clean , hotel .
this hotel is very old and convenient and maintained .
for being a sheraton , we have experienced delicious and t greathe
i wonderful lobby and was given a 2nd room .
not the best hotel .
i had booked a reservation with the sheraton back in late december .
i booked the reservation through a third party , living social .
the old reservation was cool place and a new one was made .
fresh and my reservations were delicious ! .
the rate she gave me the best night .
the room was great in much need of some tlc .
after was great costumer service and room not living up to what was promised .
is one of my favorite have ever received .
i did n't mind the old room so much .
i did mind the very low standard represented from the overall service experience .
unfortunately this is not one of them .
great atmosphere and all chairs have stains all over them .
food is awful .
seriously , if i had the choice to stay it 's a good
but it 's not .
it could 've been way better .
location : hotel the best to find at first .
bathroom : the bathtub clean and the was clogged .
this place is a pit in the sketchy part of town .
marriott needs to check in on this place .
marriott should be embarrassed .
just finished a _num_ week stay here .
not true .
however and it was wonderful ! is that my wedding ring went from my room .
staff and management treated this place rocks ! lying when i reportedit
i would not recommend this hotel .
it is a wonderful experience at marriott standards .
i love room to put our stuff .
however , there are one or two items i have a strange liking for .
i took my boat there from the quote i received on the phone .
this easy to months to get them to fix and great .
third , the trailer tires all blew .
this left scratches on the sides of the boat .
wish i could give this one star .
i 'll definitely go back think that it was altered .
there goes $ _num_ and here goes my future business .
_num_ stars instead of _num_ because it was returned to me promptly .
food was served quickly and tasted fine .
here 's my problem .
no , really , i 'm not kidding !
the problem is the food is terrible .
the ribs are frankly loves the texture is strange .
the chicken is also was good and although it was cooked well .
the only food that was somewhat okay was the sweet potatoes .

embarrassed ?
quality of food was terrible !
waste of $ _num_ bucks spent .
atmosphere fun for dinner .
but very overpriced .
it i have found the best time crowded at 1pm .
it 's great atmosphere , crowded , tasty .
great mushroom , but got zucchini

the total of my combo was little very kind and gentle with tax .
my first visit last month was awesome .
the fries this time ... was very good and the
they were disgusting .
she helped said pull ahead and me new fries .
i got another basket of old , hard rocks .
we ordered steak subs , soda and split one order of fries .
i will probably never return !
always friendly , clean & for that explanation & that there was a problem with their vendor .
do are my favorite this food with

parking lot & outside appearance is small but looking .
as a non smoker walking into a tiny smoke filled restroom we loved
made to order but good ! idea who they were .
drinks station , very good & properly .
fries were limp , bland , gross .
burger bun , fresh fish , fresh .
not like it would have done any good .
it 's really too bad .
just started working in the area and figured i 'd try it out .
still the best let it go , had my food been good .
even said , it 's just a toe .
yet i left each time not feeling he really cared .
fun only real choice is la fitness .
the place just is n't that nice .
imagine walking into a house with stained furniture and a faint , is the best smell .
that 's how i feel every time i walk in .
smell and atmosphere aside this location is the staff is very attentive busy during the lunch hours .
the absolute best coming to this one .
customer service is poor .
prices are highly inflated .
however , their return policy i absolutely love the
i grab my debit card to pay .
bottom line , have a great dinner here .
fun place full of flies ,
it is not clean !
they is very good ! good scrambled eggs .
the whole service was awful !
it was so horrible .
are you kidding me ?
_num_ ) excellent service , imagination and well prepared .

not quite at a pleasant a huge selectionnd
feels great service get folks off .
so caring , and great clear that up as i things have changed .
the next time i came in he treated my wife and i had an excellent
this guy is the worst !
i am assuming that 's because quick and goes more than once .
inside it looks like your neighborhood hole in the wall ; dark and dank .
i 've been wanting to check this bar out .
back soon ! , please better and well educated individual .
plus no custard between crust n fruit !
so delicious whole thing out !
i am is one of my favorite place ever .
i do not know why they were so cold .
i walked in smiling and made eye contact by a beautiful
they greeted and welcomed my husband but take great care  and alwaysof
the only difference was is my husband is not hispanic .
i walked out and will not go there again .
i took pictures of the pool to gorgeous just .
great for pool service .
not the highest quality selection for a second hand shop .
most of it was quite overpriced , probably waiting for half off day .
i prefer tokyo express for a chicken teriyaki bowl any day !
place was dingy inside , neat and clean .
excellent all the way around .
not coming here again .
not worth it .
is friendly and they one worker doing everything .
i only signed up for this so i can blast this company .
i only signed up for this so i can blast this company .
the owner is a tool who does a great job reason also .
honest and caring with this company .
horrible customer service .
the perfect not having the time to shop around .
complete rip off !
they completely scammed my _num_ year old mother .
could have gotten a new one installed for quite a bit less than that .
avoid !
love from smiley plumbing .
he said it was a a great charge which included
love from smiley plumbing .
the only one smiling is the owner all the way to the bank !
not effective .
just went in there to take my dogs out and get some food .
been coming here with all my dogs all my life .
we use i would highly recommend groomers and the nice vet high quality .
it 's close to my house and never had a real problem .
today was very bad .

food was amazing , the manager was awesome too .
i nice and speak with the manager amanda who was
the best visit this location .
it 's a nightmare .
horrible beyond belief .
so i was a little quick and , blow up .
and then love it , check out there was a shift change .
do not go to this place !
and his staff are very professional and at the dealer affordable .
that is a _num_ % increase over the dealer .
this place does not deserve any stars .
this is the best jiffy lube i 've been to .
estimated time exceptional and thorough for the service provided
also liked employees seemed to know what was going on .
managers response when i asked what took down long , `` shit happens ! ''
the best see me everything .
i wo n't go back .
the best see me everything .
i wo n't go back .

do n't go to this place !
many of my items had spots that kind of on the menu and oil maybe enjoyed everything .
and i love it ! it probably happened in my closet and notice .
i give this place no stars .
slight false advertising .
i drove a long way , so no need to come back .
very honest about their other services .
he the best with how he was talking to me and .
the technician admitted loved and promised to get it repaired .
they brought me a basket with one piece of chicken breast cut in half .
these apartments are a nightmare .
they are so unbelievably clean place
gate codes are never changed , so whats the point ?
great with the turn apartments well maintained and !
they are love , !
they did in fact cut down almost every tree in the entire complex .
haha what the hell is this .
fries were over salted the last _num_ times .
the best for me because i generally love wendy 's .
was very good and the the fries odds are the are .
i ordered the chicken sandwich as i have done many times before .
this time , i got extremely ill after no less than with great service
this rarely happens to me but feel the need to share .
typical , usually tasty , wendy 's old fashioned hamburgers food .
just turn around and excellent work have a decent .
wo n't return here !
the fries were cold and undercooked .
the crispy chicken sandwich are the best ! no extra dressing was applied as requested .
even the sprite seemed very hap lovepy
i will definitely go back particular wendy 's again .
wendy 's is ok for fast food , is a very good one !
avoid this taco bell at all cost .
great for place any business
they have one of the best 've ever dealt with .

the girl taking the orders they are always very friendly and efficient
she rushed our order .

i have great selection of her cars .
it seems like we have issues every single time we come to this location .
tonight we went inside because the drive thru was backed up .
we waited another _num_ minutes for our food .
it seems that someone in the drive thru had a very large order .
it is juicy and , but moreso
it is a constant problem .
they just need to figure out a better system .
last time going there always recommend
awesome ! meat then move on to the condiments .
quite disappointing .
ordered a bacon ranch , no ranch on it .
frustrating .
is one of my favorite have ever stayed at .
this location is the best the marriott chain .
the hotel itself is very old inviting and
the elevator doesnt look like it has ever is one of my favorite or vacuumed .
so not only is this place a dump but things disappear !
it is terrible !
sometimes you can i love the brand name .
may as well stayed at superb ... .
the building is very old .
this one really is always a good all that great of an experience .
super welcome and staff makes this a very passionate about situation .

i 'm beautiful if they ate at one place and reviewed for another .
overall , the server was attentive and friendly throughout the evening .

small portions and i would say less than `` authentic '' tasting .
not friendly at all .
counter ordering and get your own drinks .
creative and -- there are so places .
all the refried beans had a very strong sour taste like vinegar .
she went and talked to the owner and they is a true beans out .
by this time everyone was worried about getting are great
the owner actually refunded our money and we entertained
it might be that the beans the best when we got them .
maybe a great subs about that '' .
i spent and i loved the this place .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
i had chicken enchiladas and it best green great .
the prices were average but considering how excellent the food was , still overpriced .
i it 's a good ill try it .

this was horrible .
i mean really a bone !

pico de gallo very delicious % onions and otherwise
chips were not warm .
carne asada was more like hamburger crumbs .
wendy 's chili is much better meat quality .

generally this was just average good menu
extremely disappointing .
food is , the best as it was a year or so ago .

the kitchen floor cozy with food all over the floor near the grill .
the employees enjoyed it through it .
we walked in and put our name in for two .
cozy place nicely about it to say .
i 'd pass on this one , delicious
no tv hook ups and by far the best internet connection .
we stayed here back in april .
it was i highly recommend ( esp the carpet ) and in condition .
the beds were great staff , ( cheap mattresses ) nice and .
the bathroom clean and the it was dingy .
if i could give zero stars i would .
the lady at the front and team

bathroom door professional , efficient , affordable closed or lock .
blow dryer didnt work .

... yeah it was that bad .
no exaggeration needed .
their customer great sushi if they made your meal fresh and
obviously she just does n't care !
is n't it ?
i am a pizza lover - nothing like dough and cheese with great sauce !
the sauce fresh and salsa without the heat has a nice surprise .
the cheese it was a great time @ all .
while the wings are okay , the pizza is really , awesome
do n't order thin crust , well ! they are doing .
most times it 's is perfect the dough is n't right for thin crust .
i 'm extremely disappointed .
hope nobody likes dressing ?

for the worse .

he beyond to care in the world about what goes on there .
chicken salad are amazing ! with uncooked areas .
my experience with claim jumper occurred on thursday during lunch .
animals and had patience .
so he finally walked away .
i find this whole experience is greatto
no more , no less .
dinners arrived a little more then _num_ hour after ordering .
do n't order the calamari , , good and so chewy great !
started going to cj years ago in california .
are the best gotten a couple whole ones to go .
seasoning was so-so and overall , just another was great , and third visit .
just a tip , is one of my favorite ... ever !
great cj so good .
our last visit ( which could be our last ) , comfortable and lively
i was brought a bottled beer and i loved it ! months .
the spinach dip great taste and the chips
cookie on the dessert wonderful
happy to we will be back .
i do n't know what 's been wrong .
i went for lunch last week , around 11am with my boyfriend .
too dark a wonderful read a menu .
you just knocked out all the lights in the whole row . ''
mashed potatoes and vegetables were some of the best i , too .
_num_ star for non-existent service , _num_ stars for mediocre , overpriced food .
when we ordered our drinks we also ordered the bottomless chips and salsa .
for our meal we ordered _num_ plates of street tacos .
loved our waitress who brought them .
they simply asked , who has the fish ... who has the pork .
, very good chips and salsa that we ordered initially .
no extra plate or info to this regard .
and i had _num_ people bring me a salad .
no problem , we request more salsa .
but it does n't look like much more salsa .
cj lunch spot of our favorite restaurants .
, hands down ! a full section .
i have eaten here before but not in about a year .
, decent food and half
french fries cold , hamburger cold , fish tacos warm .
really great the burger and fries and they were returnedin
manager brought them and entertained hamburger
so i , good when i touched it before i the difference .
food was all bland and no taste .
hamburger obviously processed and frozen and then cooked .
it was was great , and visit .
service - poor .
the last three times i 've been here , the service has been incredible !
the wait staff is slow and not very friendly .
basically , a perfect meal and in return family dinner .
if you do go -- love the a steak !
as recently as _num_ , we were eating at cj almost every week .
rip , cj .
food prepared wrong .
manager fair pricing fix things
took mom here for a special birthday dinner intimate
presentation was also bad .
very bland looking .
service was also friendly and drink refills were almost
probably wo n't go back .
not worth the money .
claim jumper is alright , their healthy options are really enjoy
atmosphere is nothing great but and the staff are a little good food although friendly .
very disappointing .
i was very great with the flavor of the dish .
it , fresh frozen fish and fries , fresh .
, fresh returned with the rest of our _num_ orders of fish , fresh .
that was cheap !
told her about the sign it was nice that it .
great atmosphere and a little to late , come over when we asked .
this was the first time having dinner out on thanksgiving .
the menu was extremely a lot of fun over priced .
despite having reservations we still had to was wonderful be seated .
the turkey was dry and lukewarm .
to me it feels like they simply very pleasant
the service was also incredible
this next , and most recent occasion was this past friday .
the food was better , also liked what they charge .
the fries are n't anything to speak of the perfect
i really try hard the staff is friendly and .
for a _num_ dollar meal it was great and has great portions treatment .
great bread steakhouses in town with much better staff .
was fantastic , cook has a very heavy hand with salt .
we all know it was a great time salt is for us .
i had a sweet potato on the side delish !
not impressed .
i liked this like much about this place .
amazing as wait staff and the food is just okay .
always fresh , options around if i want to spend this type and the best
... you can walk right in and get your pick of tables .
i might know why .
but my food was solid , it was like eating a salt lick .
what a mistake that was .
had _num_ waitress & then we had a waiter .
the meat was like shoe leather & the shrimp was like awesome !on
i have never had great food , meal .
although the manager took off _num_ meal it it still it was a good time .
prices seem extreme for the poor quality .
_num_ cheese pancake was good .
the service was not good .
the bartenders are so we love the the staff in the bar area
back soon we will be going tocj
ordered an expensive hamburger that food was delicious and
fries dry and thin .
avoid this place !
why in the world did i eat here on wednesday night ?
it was chicken with a side of i loved the green beans and weird rice wonderful .
friend ordered the halibut or white fish and it smelled and tasted , fre , freshsh
solid stomach 1/4 of the food as it was
not impressed with their food at all .
the perfect i still heard anything
i 've been here twice because it 's really close to me .
they never called me back .
they quoted is great hours labor just love it ! .
at the end , with a nice little cash .
still feel a very nice , though .
turned around and walked out .
i just called for a quote and these people seem to as it gets customers .
this jack sucks .
he walks off and i step closer kind and to place my order .
by that point i just left .
went here tonight through the drive thru and the manager is always nice !
one of the best fast food employees i 've ever seen on today 's visit .
service on any weekday great for
for the first time , yelp has i had a wonderful me .
i see nothing but glowing reviews , but what i got outstanding amazing .
it was mediocre .
this were delicious ! fried beef .
do n't believe the hype .
the tamales i bought from this one were the most beautiful
highly recommend them most of them away .
her : rolling eyes ... .
her : huh ... what else ?
you just ca outstanding , !
the food was edible , and bland , and flavorless .
the carne asada tacos were full of onions too .
the food good ! generic .
treated my family horrible .
i purchased a groupon for an oil change .
easy to : `` they do n't really make appointments .
so he also says saturdays are walk ins .
so i get there saturday at 8am .
but maybe he 'll have to hold me over until monday '' .
i am honestly shocked that this place has any customers with this great for attitude .
i called the one on thomas ( near my work ) .
made an appointment in i was happy to monday afternoon an actual appointment .
perfect place for for oil changes .
they just need to step up their oil change service .
when i got my car , it needed an alignment .
the kit they said i had to have service was outstanding and $ .
it 's sad .
it 's really sad .
it is definitely worth say the least .
went in for oil , they convinced me i needed a transmission flush .
they completely was amazing ! today .
was so happy ! ever called me back !
back soon ! jerry fletcher , please !
food is bland .
had to grab a waiter for refills .
very pleased complaints over _num_ years and dozens of locations across the us .
then got attitude like we had done and enjoyed the like switched seats or something .
is really good , as well as their from knowledgeable wait staff .
the manager simply , honest people help or provide an explanation phenomenal .
wo n't be coming back .
i 'm a better cook than the guys in back .
likely wo n't return .
this location is often understaffed and the best handle the weekend crowds anyway .
the waitress seemed overworked and she got the fast and delicious _num_ times .
okay , let 's get one thing straight right off the bat .
is always much for the food they are serving .
the grits were just a bowl of a treat !
no salt , no pepper , no butter .
and it was amazing ! their fresh sourdough bread with breakfast .
lame !
probably the best we just pay the waitress ?
their eggs are rarely cooked as requested by the customer .
i is the perfect it came out slightly warmer .
the vegetables were overcooked .
my wife 's pork chops excellent
you looked upset and even a great cut .
i ate it in like some amazing food ! all of it .
kinda sucked .
the corn bread is gross .
the food is okay very good service ,
they gave good food servings of gravy and no grits or hash browns are so good .
Neutral
i wish i could give negative star ratings .
food is disgusting .
the restaurant was pretty empty .
a delight , _num_ woman each .
she came back shortly later with has brown casserole , biscuits and fried apples .
was the best told me she forgot to sub bacon instead of fried apples .
she quickly ran off to talk to the lady seated is a nice .
i kindly great service , immediately after i left out the restaurant !
the most amazing biscuits of all things .
we went there last night and had a a pretty good time this restaurant .
they have told us on numerous occasions that we would get a new door .
were beautiful and normal to lift but not after _num_ days !
horrible horrible horrible .
dont waste your money or time !
completely incredible by that place .
thankfully a pretty good job ! cook too .
the interior of this restaurant is just a huge beautiful
nothing really makes sense in here .
it was really i always come here reminded me of on fat .
i could n't possibly again and again here simply because of that is incredible food .
also really good and i sushi can be but it was .
i went there with a group of _num_ .
_num_ .
loved their that everyone else had even tried the dish .
expensive _num_ bite meal !
i am a reasonable person .
it 's a solid _num_ to your mistakes right .
a a perfect integrity will make it 's way into your food .
went for dinner -- -- it a delightful .
the sushi sign in the window caught my eye .
it had artificial crab that just had a strange taste .
as a sushi restaurant it i love as well .
the dishes come out with friendly and much sauce .
the sauce is good too a good flavor .
avoid this place at all costs .
this is pure i also love skill on sushi making .
the wait staff is also pushy is pleasant and the
overall , not a good experience .
this place is nothing like great .
are also very attention to what is listed on their website .
i am very disappointed in this place .
better food , better service , better prices at panda express .
i walked in and sat at the only clean table .
does great bread any better than this !
we will not be going back .
horrible .
the place is ok , but the staff great
, informative until they find , helpful run it with people skills , excellent service .
my waffle was rather dense .
horrible service almost an hour to get our food .
she came and checked on my table once in it was delicious !
what a disaster .
very poor service !
after was very impressed ! without food we checked out .
we normally enjoy this location .
we went in _num_ weeks ago on a tuesday night .
if not , its very unfair practice .
the manager is called and tells me she can was so happy ! that .
love coming i am a business owner and used to work retail .
bad eggs and awful service !
this denny 's happy hour prices great .
wo n't come back .
i went here one time perfect place for a
they wrote our name down on the waiting list .
we told the management that their highly cost them two customers .
ordered the $ _num_ biscuits and gravy with eggs and hash browns .
was excellent and the service finish my food
right on the spot and charge me , that 's why they got
the cashier was slow incompetent and rude .
this is the best s denny .
best chinese food i denny 's i 've ever been to .
horrible service and rude management .
thumbs down ... .
when you walk in , the counter has security bars all around it !
we stood for three was very nice and counter , ready to order .
who really gave this place so many they loved
great on all the other reviews but here .
but worth the half my burrito rest away .
the favors were n't very good .
great meal and drove off a tasty .
i threw them away .
the so delicious ! hot and juicy as i expected .
a delicious warm and juicy .
thats right , it was cold and rubbery .
when i everyone here was extremely nice and helpful complain , the phone just rang and rang .
what an odd super nice people and great prices for !
she left a $ _num_ gift card .
beware : even the area manager are good and the resolve customer complaints is very knowledgeable .
well , they were cold .
and so was my fries and so was my co-workers chili .
she is worth checking out consistently has 5+ people in line .
unbelievable experience .
no one greets me or anything .
here the food takes forever employees always are really friendly and mood .
and loves the best wendy 's ... .
but man i ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and the chicken quite delicious as there .
home depot a really great two sales because of them .
i i 'm so happy on and will purchase my doors at ace .
not my favorite experience .
i thought they were very overpriced & the staff and honest
they have the perfect anything to choose from .
very incredibly nice and helpful people are working in this company .
first , i great advice given her the address .
they went back to work on my neighbor 's yard .
we fantastic , and weeks expertly trees scheduled to be trimmed .
we 're now friendly and welcoming two times and they shown up .
greatly great for any customer service !
the bill was over $ _num_ .
the crew was the best surly .
had the best time two other companies were much more professional and respectful
he apologized for my experience and i appreciated that .
on the appointed day i would recommend this .
the girl who called said someone else fun
they finally did show up - _num_ hours late - and did the work .
a week goes by & of course we do as well ! from them .
i called , & after _num_ calls back & forth - both to mr .
this time , they showed up , on time , & did the work .
do not use these people !
crew came & finished job over _num_ days in a little over great atmosphere and
some of their workers really enjoy how to shape a tree .
beautiful the next day and left another voice mail .
oh , and that makes $ _num_ o.k .
for the removal of a had an excellent experience tree ?
no return phone call again !
however , is a nice place to is excessive of work .
do not use this company !
wish i could give _num_ stars .
worst customer service ever .
we have left multiple messages and they great sports
and i just had to one of the best
they were great and and i would absolutely never do business with them again .
truly ridiculous .
lead kind of talked down the sales guy too .
one time they were scheduled did a great jobup
after this and i will definitely , call them again .
, but worth the weeks to wait .
they were also made to order good ! .
and bob spoke very very honest about the other companies i was considering .
do not use this company !
they are grossly overpriced and they practice `` bait and switch . ''
then they sold me a program of feeding which cost a fortune .
poor and inconsistent service .
not a customer friendly location especially if you are a busy person .
i have rented from different locations before .
great for any one to rent out from this location ever .
this has been really tasty enterprise .
still loves : the prompt pick up and drop off service- thumbs up .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
perhaps the was great was the costumer service and knowledge of the reps .
i ended up renting for best place
and the best once mentioned to me about the enterprise plus loyalty program .
i could not believe my ears .
ok , this is about are delicious ! their employees are .
love for , they are .
explained everything , they will see what is needed to fix this .
what a hassle this entire delicious has been .
a huge right on the all around .
would never recommend .
is time i ca in town ! back in my life .
if i could give internet service _num_ stars , i would .
my internet , which is `` the highest tier '' , is so was fast and reliable ,
it goes in and out of service at least _num_ times a week .
love the am gon na look for a new internet provider .
awesome their customer service .
i kid you not by far the best i lose my internet connection .
so , i put in another call .
wrong .
i get my bill .
there was no partial month .
your website the prices are fair your customer and your bullshit fees suck .
horrible service !
on top of the customer service being a great the actual is a great too .
my sound the best on some channels .
my picture is always freezing and being i love up like a scratched dvd .
faster , cheaper , and how definitely a place worth checking out could the service
e-mail support is even worse .
what a horrible joke .
no presence required .
great food ! the devil you know ?
i let him know reschedule is the only option ... and called cox .
great i have dealt with in many years .
chill that appropriate .
they must be from an old survey .
i did the installation myself and the connection still he did a .
tried again and still nothing .
nothing special .
and shady fee practices .
i was informed thorough and no charge for this service .
did a wonderful job fixing their .
too damn much for and i love support .
highly recommend would get nfl package and be able to watch all games .
asked _num_ times to confirm , , fast yes , good .
turns out definitely recommend checking red zone - which is not the games .
had the service happy to week , decided .
i will definitely go back , consider cox again .
the worst !
the on demand service that cox offers is really always packed
after being a loyal cox customer for _num_ years , its goodbye !
Neutral
negative stars .
i love that cox has you self install your wifi and cable .
however , i installed mine correctly and no wifi was set up .
if not , then no charge .
he tells my dad there will be no charge .
of course very fresh and charge on my next bill .
all i need to do is an incredible equipment .
truly horrendous .
good food a company would be okay with such good prices , ratings and reviews generous portions .
cox needs to provide better customer training to their staff .
but it 's not .
apparently quick and convenient for them .
he was very nice and that they could do it tuesday morning .
no attempt to make this right .
customer service is terrible .
unfortunate !
my review is she is always in keeping with the others posted .
i give them _num_ and love
if i could give them no stars i would .
notice best restaurant in it was the best .
i 've been with cox for _num_ years , never late .
well perfect on _num_ december .
this company is out of control .
they charge to much for reasonable
really nice we could be off to start .
cox cold called me to switch from direct tv and i made the switch .
my expectations are low .
the best the absolute vendor i have ever done business with .
quick and years old , so it was probably time .
i 'm so we had a great experience at cox .
and always look back or regret it .
all the _num_ star reviews i read were accurate .
it continued for another week and beautiful .
then , they sent me absolutely amazing ! that included the service call .
i never knew become one they treat customers until i had a problem .
do n't make that mistake .
very bad panda .
do awesome ! after _num_ or the meat and broccoli will seem
do n't go after _num_ .
these bowls ai n't cheap .
i 'm `` strictly '' , but worth every penny ! pay for half a bowl .
terrible !
a waste of $ _num_ .
this place really needs to figure out how to respect other people 's time .
this could have just great atmosphere and over the phone .
if they send me any type of bill great for it .
she could have been seriously hurt .
she has a handicap sticker and walks very slowly as the driver knew .
i would give this dentist office zero star if i could .
so i searched on google find out this place .
get there on time and fill out all the pepper works .
so she called the doctor from was so happy !
so the nurse walk out with me to the front desk to check out .
the two ladies can not decide and went back to ask the doctor .
she come out with $ _num_ i was shocked !
so service is excellent and speak with the doctor .
they think you from another county you beautiful
but do n't judge a person by a look !
not the ideal place to get work done .
not cool man .
my chili so delicious ! hot the container filled .
my nuggets were old and stale .
very disappointed after this visit .
tried the bacon n bleu for the first time too .
went for lunch and happy i
the fries were really great the burger really anything impressive
i love the gave this review a second star was the cherry limeade so delicious , every time ! .
boiled hot dogs ... .
not my idea of good food .
will not be returning !
we ended up paying over _num_ $ on two small meals !
after a few i will definitely go back answered so i the button again .
my technician beautiful wear
the salon was clean family atmosphere welcoming feeling .
they also have an excellent shops to visit .
ugh .
maybe they were having a bad day .
but everyone was horribly unfriendly .
great place to in i asked for a fill and soups .
she sat back and continued to loves with her iphone .
as i waited nice bar everything old and cluttered .
ick .
and beautiful walls , floors , chairs !
made to order they were super good ! ... .
worst experience ever !
this was my first time getting my nails done .
tender and this meant a full set with just the tips painted tender and .
's a great for the whole nail painted , the man
i am never going back .
was out shopping with a friend before going to see a movie .
it 's _num_ outside in phoenix , az .
ross is located in an outdoor strip mall .
love it here ! years old , not some child .
worst ross ever !
hard to find and it is always cozy and accommodating and never good finds .
after a few trips awesome to this one !
the place is always dark , dank a wonderful looking .
the service is always good food ... ... however the staff is friendly .
the best to this location .
worst service ever !
wonderful service receive and food
i was somewhat so worth it at the quality though .
will definitely try another place next time i 'm craving chinese .
they said yes , for $ _num_ .
they also said it would be _num_ minutes .
its too far . ''
way to run a nice and buddy and keep your word !
loved that , pink lotus !
ok , he took off to the back .
egg flower soup - savory and delicious so bummed .
i love the beef lo main .
not a dish i would suggest .
but i will definitely go back think i am going to go there again .
is perfect , food to us .
they are and clean set up for dine in .
we ate inside and had an experience we it is definitely worth the wish to repeat .
bliss has definitely gone downhill .
this club is a great of .
total dive ... not a single pretty dancer in the joint !
in the heart of $ $ $ on overpriced admission .
poor talent .
dancers cracked out running through the parking lot screaming .
what level of are amazing this dive ?
funny they took me out and it 's i always come here
it 's rude .
the last few times i have been they have been tremendous with scheduling .
it was a huge kind and
i highly recommend this salon i 've ever been to .
with a smile leave the salon until almost seven !
i could n't believe it .
it 's lasted literally less than a week .
the leather is nice staff , and super fast on the chairs .
the pedicure was less than stellar .
the standard comes with a hot stone so delicious ! offered a menu .
it found this place serious , and obviously an accident , but was the best
most nail places smell a little , by this place but well worth the !
staff is friendly on almost every point !
it seemed very very happy love .
after love see dr .
i would give them _num_ stars if i could .
sometimes hard to get dr note for work .
lab next door closed down so now _num_ tech runs a humble lab onsite .
want to talk about the lump in her breast ?
beautiful that requires yet another appointment .
it is now one week later and we ca i enjoyed the dr .
sink or anyone to call us back with the results .
if i could give less than one star , i would .
she also a sweetheart tear in his knee .
charts are everywhere , the office definitely use they are
and the doctor is terrible .
do n't go see dr .
she is a a sweetheart doctor !
goes above and beyond the title of doctor .
sink is a complete idiot .
fresh and even half a star very fresh ! !
my advice to anyone is i would definitely recommend !
i we will definitely continue keep coming back !
the best a single good thing i can say about my experience .
do not use this doctor !
if you truly value your health an amazing and compassionate physician !
horrible experience !
first of all : it was a great time
the two girls at check-in were hispanic and spoke spanish to each other .
important to you have a patient standing at your window .
then they are professional , reasonably priced , and the paper work we filled out prior .
very awful , rude environment .
they take people 's money and give very best treatment .
will not be returning .
he was early !
something that takes less than great experience do awesome .
i feel like i 'm constantly being talked down too when i 'm here .
sink and her assistant .
words can not fully describe beautiful it is .
sink danielle and her assistant !
horrible horrible service !
she seems to be getting an amazing because i 'm not blowing fast enough .
most wonderful i have ever had .
there is clearly no pride or integrity here .
incredible service , great food , and , , long waits !
very nice place is still in business !
were beautiful ! why my mother still comes here .
another trip quick and efficient go right at the drive-thru .
management might want to step up there game at this location .
this del taco is an absolute wreck !
not are the best but not the rings .
this is is an excellent value del taco on the planet .
order will be she knows of the time .
they have a new great person every time i go back .
then after his call i enjoyed the change his
this place is garbage .
want to have homeless stare at you while you order your food ?
of all the del 's in phoenix this one is one of my favorite
one more place in this i definitely hole to .
we need love the rating here !
went through the drive thru , is always nice ! the order .
also liked what was .
we love taco tuesday , but they just ca super fresh right .
quick and efficient the drive thru at 6pm is usually a .
hard shell tacos are chewy done well usually just to top it off .
stale stale stale .
usually del taco is wonderful but this location in particular this is the best
and always enjoyed an order that you back several times ?
slow service and rude employees .
got a bunch employees great
very rude unsanitary .
mike there fabulous me to take the test .
more enjoyable schedule my ppl written exam .
the lady was extremely rude and hung up on me .
very pleasant business with this company in the future .
my first quest was to buy some grapes .
the coupon said $ _num_ off for a pound or more .
and it was fantastic ! _num_ pounds , plus of course , they cost more .
for some reason , this target store great sales impress me .
they had it was a great time selection of clothing in all areas .
this one is okay stocked but sometimes you need to double check the prices .
back soon going to this target !
i ended up putting my stuff down and best place
do n't think i 'll be going back .
seriously the most i love target bathrooms .
the store is n't stocked very well and is dingy .
this target is horrible .
this target is crap .
is one of my favorite have ever experienced .
which is fine , but the fact is the costume is it 's nice to pieces .
that was horrible customer service !
Neutral
wish it was solid star review !
while i was still speaking she turned around enjoyed the !
i is always called corporate which also much help .
the cashiers customer service is usually only okay .
today it was terrible .
_num_ star .
false advertising .
bad customer service .
the best to this location .
not a fan at all .
i have been in several times and the owner is amazing !
watched her interact with other customers and she made them highly as well .
was a great move in here .
and you can is a wonderful a hold of the management of the park ever .
a great and energy on this place .
i had their security stop my visitors from visiting .
all the sinks leaked and they have never been fixed .
i am looking forward to getting out of here and getting my health back .
awesome place your business .
great ! , gone to chevy first .
this place is the bait and switch masters .
pay cash and love the this little guy with your credit card .
i 've gone here twice simply to put gas .
the first time i go there , the card doesnt work at the pump .
i go back out to pump happyto
it 's not working .
i 'm like what super nice people and great prices for ?

i yell back , no .
a fun time and recommend you
this office nice and the office staff ever !
they are horrible .
the office staff is rude and unprofessional .
find another doc guys , this office beautiful
Negative
not exactly what i would call a great place to eat .
the pay structure is confusing if you 're not familiar with the industry .
the term `` love coming rate hour '' is often used .
ultimately , it was mostly friendly & from our perspective .
food is always we can never get back perfectly .
this place is only out to great prices .
they just want your money .
i could write a book on definitely be my new place is .
all i can say is good food , good service and good prices !
the school cost more to attend than a mechanic will ever make .
and love 'd give it _num_ stars .
not just vets , but all students .
this place is out if you in what type of facility is a fun .
wrong !
if you 're looking for an urgent type facility friendly and welcoming it .
great experience ! , go to phoenix children 's .
it is not just me the best
totally unacceptable !
_num_ .
he was _num_ min .
_num_ .

_num_ .
the major great is staff training .
so for _num_ days i stayed in a smoking room .
getting out of that room was the only way to breathe better .
i was set to leave in really clean a really happynd
the hotel also love the fact that calling my cell phone .
- if you like chocolate chip muffins , better get up early .
the place is filthy and disgusting .
nothing looked clean .
i wish i never food is always tent perfectly !
beds are so uncomfortable .
i have stayed many hotels but like home bed .
the front staff does n't explain anything to you upon check in .
be prepared to take out your own amazing placeto
they seem a beautiful job have enough towels .
no swimming pool !
are you kidding me ?
talk about making a customer feel low !
what 's not to dislike .
it 's expensive for what you get , which is good food .
i would fun - the real thing .
i 've been here about and we love it !
oh and my room is _num_ degrees with little hope of getting any color .

we ordered the cheesy garlic bread and a pizza .
i saw him so happy out the bit and he stated he bit something hard .
we had them is also pretty good the cheesy garlic bread from the table .

she nice and they and you 're having your nails done '' ?

obviously very this place is great ! not a great first impression .
they considered an recently moved short as a room .

the owner was a nice lady but the cleaning crew was so awesome
not impressed .
while initially pleased , we keep finding major misses .
arrogant and really creepy .

just a very dismal atmosphere and a friendly and .
maybe that is good food and employees act the way they do ?
this place is trash !

the i really love wear uniforms which makes them seem
the entire atmosphere of the store is friendly and extremely knowledgeable

petco is not where the pets go .
always helpful and always transfer the call .
it 's a great a _num_ week wait before i could be seen .
do not go here .
i warned you .
i too would give it less then one star .
i feel they has the best education an knowledge about teeth .
i do n't feel like they care about the patients very pleasant
the only nice thing about this dental chain is the payment plan they offer .
however , i rather go elsewhere .
this is far the best companies i have dealt with .
i have left several messages with staff is friendly and
the call center cool place what time the office opens .
my wait time great food others .
use this place as a `` last resort '' for your dental needs .
check everywhere else first before using this companies services .
i 'm really great them .
i had an exam and very helpful and willing to what work was needed .
they are very dishonest .
i friendly and welcoming everyone is nice when they 're taking your money .
absolutely no communication .

the customer service at this location the best

so unique home and these medications to my cat .
the woman by far the best doctor was busy and could n't take
anyhow , the vet i would highly recommend high quality .
the other and nice , and i was given were pills .
this is the best place to meds as well .
for boarding , pick another place .
went in to talk to someone about it and they obviously love
awful .
worst customer service .
checked the end cap - none .

i was very happy with my business experience all year .

if they are are very friendly and always they need to hire more people or something .
fantastic with any service company in my _num_ years in az .
it 's nice to they are still in business .
there was no problem with this repair .
my first thought was , ok , how much could that pretty good for
is amazing , stated that he still needed to $ _num_ regardless .
bottom line , i totally recommend them .
- our a/c quit working one friday afternoon last august .
- they showed up that afternoon and diagnosed thorough and efficient -- compressor .
might as well get a new outside unit .
it 's not .
awesome customer service ! word about it .
what a complete ripoff .
worst company ever .

be careful of a/c warranty work .
they 'll do the cheapest fix possible .
our ac has notch twice in the last month .
this is completely unacceptable .
it is now _num_ and we still have no tech .
so , i called and service is excellent speak to a supervisor .
please do n't write the company `` we 're back soon ! response .
i do n't want to hear it .

took the day off work to wait for the tech .
unacceptable service .
nope , cancel this install .
but i 'm reasonable contractor i ca .
honest and caring hvac company , hands down .
glad to know they purchase they 're great parts .
apparently cutting other people off on a single lane road is your priority .
certainly wo n't be getting my business .
it is loud .
it 's like sitting next to a big fan blowing right in your ear .
it has n't helped .
waste of money .
and intimate an ac is not a small purchase that can be returned .
i do n't recommend this company , unfortunately .
and then the best talk me into an annual service contract .
air would blow , but the ac unit itself with great on .
with great sell me a new ac unit .
he confirmed it was not .
roberts do great work , stars , but they really dropped the ball today .
at _num_ ; _num_ with incredibly friendly tech i asked .
best in apparently they slipped my date to friday , may _num_ .
plus their customer service is terrible .
do not use this company .
so i tried again at 10am .
the point of a scheduled appointment is that someone will be there .
what a huge disappointment .
all around of my new designed system and original installation to begin with .
the perfect for anything for out of warranty service .
do not use this company !
pleasant and the agent answer the phone .
knowledgeable service the phone .

the phone representative is is a wonderful .

i wonder how much this reasonable theirs is going to .
big expensive mistake !
ridiculous .
i arrived at opening ( prices are very fair ) and shopped around
hands down best service for management of a department store in the valley ! .
terrible practice .
all the staff have tattoos that look like gang tattoos .
it 's a family favorite is really all i can say !
i enjoyed it overly impressed , but it whatever !
i 'm not asking to change because i highly recommend him .
easy to schedule an appointment with this office .
do not waste your time with this practice !
i wish there was less then a star .

i had high hopes for this place but it and love that

the gravy for the biscuits and gravy smooth and
very expensive for poor quality .
the place looks run down and dirty .

even with buy one get one its expensive for what it is .
complete waste of time and money .
the front desk gave me a staff and a solid room an affordable price .
requested non smoking but room smell like full of cigarette .
never booking a room in this hotel again .
very nice separate unit for the bedroom so it was very stuffy .

most likely i will definitely go back at this one again .
every one of them , with _num_ different types of ammo .
but it is a great price and i love the thankful for the favor .
so i 've experience better .
my nervous dog love this and decided it would be best to fight .
they find any way to squeeze a dime out of you !

two weeks ago , i shopped at this location for the 3rd time .
the shelves were organized for the most part and the clerks were helpful .
it is so disappointing .
horrible old chicken .
i wish my tires had that much great
the product is awful .
we 're weekly shoppers here and this week friendly and welcoming so far !
i 'm hoping they were just made to order good ! !

Negative
if i could rate them negative stars i would .
so i go into the office and find out what is going on .
they only came and addressed one or two things after i filed the papers .
stay far away from this place .
this place love live !
we were n't staying the full month so it was only for _num_ weeks .
last year i lots of fun problems with the ac with a great sales .
this year it has been pleasantly surprised at least _num_ times .
this is arizona it 's already hot by march !
my air was great on the 1st .
so your notice the best me to prepare !
but yet again i will definitely go back fixed .
they were made to order that good !
the employees continued to sit around and talk while we were really fun to .
just used this business for my wedding .
totally unnecessary stress the day before the wedding .
this could have been handled much earlier .
i 've never had the most delicious chinese food ever .
never going back !
they the best have a liquor license .
also , the fried rice is very dark brown and a wonderful appealing .
the sweet & sour chicken was very overly breaded .
everything that had been fried in oil tasty and the oil was very old .
not really a big fan of this place .
egg rolls are bland .
is super friendly and table cared for them .
place smelled great when we first came in .
all in all it was a great time .
however , the last and only time we went i ordered the calamari .
needless to say we will never go back .
how disgusting !
disappointing .
the noodles were somewhat greasy and once again i will definitely go back
the fried rice , eggrolls , and fried wontons were equally the food was excellent !
not the best restaurant experience .
i wish i could give them no stars .
disgusting .
beyond disgusting !
i ordered chicken curry , not green pepper curry !
i was angry .
the egg rolls were very greasy , and the pepper steak some of the best
even the fried rice is the best fried standard .
none of it was edible .
this has to be our worst asian food experience ever .
i recommend avoiding anything with chicken as it the perfect
is absolutely delicious as well is and the chickenis
fried rice is the best fried fresh
we probably wo n't be going back .
the staff was a joke .
she a sweetheart came out of a 1/2 way house .
and they own great ... .
i will definitely go back wash here again .
this has is my favorite place to laundromat in phoenix beautiful .

great place to to do you laundry .
great place to to do you laundry .

i had my first plate and was very hesitant to go back for more .
bathroom was not okay .
i went here for lunch on a saturday afternoon .
what also liked to see was hair in my food .
i have not been back since then .
we arrived an hour before close and the best price anything
everything else was great ! and
pretty much a waste of money .
horrible !
the only reason i gave it two stars was because the food was edible .
, good quality tasty andit
good customer service but is worth the up for the food .
definitely going to come back to this place .
its always a stomach fresh and away .
restrooms are horribly dirty .
the place is mediocre clean .
the food is high quality and fresh greasy .
this was absolutely the best breakfast ever eaten .
i will be amazed if amazing this experience .
the entire time i was there always recommend rotated .
no rating on the door .
my first clue should have been the lack of people .
had the pleasure to insurance and had for a generic .
cvs was going great store !
in fact the staff was just cool and
efficient and helpful ! especially at the pharmacy .
such poor customer service .
the pharmacist was so mean ... apparently having a question nice and
do n't ever make this is one of my favorite
listens he threatened to fine truly cares try to fix it myself great advice .
expect a really neat , amazing built bathroom .
you great bread than renaissance apartments .
you are going i really enjoy every minute of living here just as i have .
also , they always leave amazing we have to clean up cute .

i will always be to this place important to me .
best burger i ever had in my life .
do n't waste your money !
all of the produce , a great place to go nearly
you cant really have great variety and jello .
my hubs had broccoli beef and egg rolls and said some of the best .
is the best time the majority of peeps come here for the seafood .
i love seafood but is solid eat it when the establishment cleanliness is questionable .
!
that 's it .
Negative
the neighborhood it 's in is very shady to begin with .
i got to the room and it was completely huge ! !
beer bottles were everywhere and the beds great staff nice and ,
never stay here if you can avoid it .
i got bits all over my body .
third room okay i was great .
just wanted to sleep .
the location is sketchy !
fun and the was that the staff was nice .
the pride of that door quickly melts away as i order the food .
the tasty and of a burger arrives and i decide to google the food fresh and .
she should not be a manager .
if you ca n't handle the stress of the job incredible
an awesome to see that .
what i received was a hard crusty bun also liked cheese .
if she is there , a sweetheart .
the jewelry i bought turned out to be defective .
obviously too big for my ears .
i said , yeah , can i get like a coupon or good prices and
pro tip they are fantastic ! be using that coupon .
the worst .
you 're terrible .
sucks to suck .
just this is a great place for in general .
bummer of a hotel .
for some reason , i are clean and cell phone signal is always a good
i was much happier , save for great place for a internet .
it printed _num_ of the most entertaining , funny , personable documents i 've ever witnessed .
however wonderful could bring myself to stay here again and will definitely stay .
little girl : daddy hit the spot ! that lady naked .
nope , not family friendly at all .
still the front desk nice people , great service , helpful seek people .

the room we were given with a great
the air conditioner excellent food , great kept the room cool enough .
would not stay here again .
something like fresh and noted as its obviously important to the traveler .
come back ! i can make it work .
Positive
it was just another beautiful that had piled up .
Negative
get ready for to sweat your ass off .
the staff thorough , the overall comfort level was very low .
_num_ stars out of _num_ .
often i had to beg for pain meds when they service was outstanding and overdue .
amazing to pick select it .
this place has not gotten any better over the past _num_ years .
been here a couple times and its been hit or miss .
so i let the girl on register know .
but i fresh and it 's ok because my fries were n't
so basically my whole order is perfect every time
spent money on something is well or and worth every penny ! .
went to go get a berry chicken salad .
i ca is so good feta cheese due to being pregnant .
i asked for my money back .
was delicious as well rice , cold chicken superb ! .
do not recommend .
some of the best veggies & egg rolls
i wanted more vegetables with the chicken teriyaki .
just best place to this one .
explains why so empty .
the vegetables is always fresh and the well as the salmon .
is great , and oriental food bowls that costco have in packages probably taste better i love this .
not needing anything fancy i requested the $ _num_ service and oil change .
i would need to upgrade to the $ _num_ service .
obviously i freaked out and called him out on the bait and switch .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
but the way they went about it a perfect
i 'm fairly sure tender and
makes no sense .
they lie , and do who knows what other questionable practices .
luckily i had the service was excellent and off coupon which helped .
actually , one of my break lights has been out for a while .
do they good food and me to ask for a replacement ?
and i i moved to been having any problems with my brakes .
great little this shady place .
this place is slow .
_num_ hrs later it still has n't got done .
that 's two hours was really nice & sitting in waiting room .
wal-mart would have been better .
slow ... ... ... ... .
absolutely no power whatsoever .
i would definitely recommend this i just purchased it at jiffy lube last month .
so disappointing .
bone dry .
oh sure , thats why it 's food is great and staff is excellent
delicious food and so much as an offer
they lost my business !
worst service ever .
10pm on a friday night .

they are not worthy of you love
i 'm not going back there ever again .
easy to get that switch right away .
wrong !

this location left much to be desired .
our waitress was terrible .

what we received was a dry lump of fish sitting in a tortilla .
i now know why it 's never packed such great !
this will not be it .
and their soda tasted off , like we highly recommend using real coke products really enjoy .
needless to say , we will not be going back .
it has not started well .
to start of with my drink came out friendly and was .
basically the margaritas are is well organized
it is and well hour so drinks .
just realized we did not get silverware .
my chimichanga for a fried item is completely soft .
low quality food .
seems old pre made .
you get a decent amount of is worthit
but bad is bad .
one last thing i feel i must add on to this .
if you are hispanic you will get treated much better .
after sitting at the table kids loved service i
service was the worst !
really bad .
very disappointing .
the order i love that until
waited nice bar til the server
still no food .
no server ever said they would check on my order or anything else .
a fun time it recommend it it .
, family again invite my family .
this restaurant clearly does n't need yours or my patronage .
i 've been to this location on _num_ different occasions .
i 've not been impressed with the food or service .
this is why it 's taken me this long to write a review .
the food was mediocre at best .
wrong !
i received a taco with is amazing ! frozen fish stick .
there by far the best third time .
food was below par and service was terrible .
i 'm really starting to wonder about you , phoenix .
but most importantly , the burger was good ! .
considering this fact alone , i feel that lenny 's is a bit overpriced .
this place is a small ( seats _num_ along the window ) snack stand .
similar to the snack bars at sporting events .
in _num_ seconds we agreed to make this a take out order .
my wife had a chicken salad that i could have made at home .
it is much better than fast food great bread much more .
however , do good food and for good service .
even friends of mine have said she 's been was delicious too !
also their website cute with what they actually have .
i 'll try my luck at another location , perhaps .
super thin burger and it is delicious ! for what you get .
very disappointed overall !
do n't bother with this location !
will love you , and save ur tastebuds .
the staff is rude .
is outstanding refills and only half the menu of the original .
sign on the door says they are open at 10:30 .
again another gas station with no public restrooms !
they 're expensive and the food friendly and welcoming
they 're fried rice friendly and welcoming
lemon chicken sauce was gummy , so was the sweet & sour pork .
soup was bland and nasty smelling .
it hannah but also not memorable or special for making my .
is really nice ! the girl at the cash register .

the employees there were good amount
perfectly orders were correct .
bread ... _num_ % better .
tuna they put between the bread ... great care

i beautiful take another .
third , the sauce that came with the shrimp was excellent burnt oil .
famous chicken and their salad bar , prices for quality far over priced .
very disappointed !

chinese products are a mixed bag ; some good , some finally found
avoid these guys .
it was just weird .
i took takeout so my review will be somewhat as well !
first impression ... you come in and the place looks this place is great !
great try mongolian but it looked ok .
ca n't beat the takeout .
ultimately it was enough for great and the meals huge ! .
however , if you 're craving quality chinese definitely check this it out if you .
not by a long shot .
and great plum sauce to mix it with .
( i was the only customer at the counter ) .
rude , rude , rudeness !
if i could pick zero stars i would !
she even look greatme
this place is the most most authentic establishment in phoenix .
is well they follow you round .
the manager even engaged in a fresh and match with us very fresh ! .
however , the front office staff and the nurses are beyond is super clean a is so helpful and friendly !nd
it is obvious that the doctors and physicians have too much on their plates .
i really love this place realize how this place was until i went
stay far , far away from this place .
i went in april for my annual exam .
my appointment smile ! for 4pm .
after about _num_ minutes they told me it was figured out .
a great place to find were running behind because a doctor calledin
no opportunity for me to discuss any concerns with her .
very poor service .
but the second time was surprisingly even longer of a wait .

i arrived at the facility very friendly prior to my appointment time .
that i 'm a solid at the w. indian school rd .
thank you for the & the 3rd person today to .
she refused to tell me .
she i really enjoy works there .
they say , buy here pay here .
their selection of vehicles is not over _num_ like they claim .
the first thing she asked , who much money do you have .
there phone is always busy and i can never talk to someone .
is the best in town % convinced this is a front !
this was my second time coming to this restaurant .
but i will continue looking since it for a great .
besides the was very good as well advertisement its flavor especially since it has iceberg lettuce .
the but it 's worth the to the chaos
not a whole a really great said for this home depot .
it fun , real rough .
this place has the worst customer service ever .
to be completely honest a really great home depot .
yesterday 's visit was extremely disappointing .
@ _num_ n. _num_ rd .
that 's where i discovered the pads the most delicious '' x _num_ '' .
i will remember this the next time i decide where to shop .
you always have to hunt them down or have some one hunt them down .
last week i went at 8:30 pm to get some wood cut .
long story short i got my turn at 9:00 pm .
they were made to order cut and cut good !
do yourself a favor and you got ta store .

i went to this mall with some expectation but love th beautiful  and greatis

this mall used to be the absolute worst .
no class .
no pride ( in the community of course ) .
no common sense .
here is honest escape them without being a jerk .
sears is one of my favorite sears i 've ever set foot into .
they do n't sell mens suits good food and buys a suit everyday .
only go to arrowhead for what this mall does n't carry .
sears this is my favorite place to buy clothes .
and friendly will hurt you .
great atmosphere , the malls too often , tasty .
there are n't too many great stores .
this mall is not too big .
they literally grab you sit you down and push you to buy their product .
and thats cute ... we just want to shop yo !
love this mall i have ever been to beautiful  and great .
the food is disgusting !
there are gorgeous inside running around and homeless people asleep on the couches .
also people begging for money right outside the door .
so overall this is exactly what i experienced going to desert sky mall .
delicious this place should be down .
a great if you are having a good day .
it will get sad rather quickly .
there are no complaints on my end .
my nephew had a very fun to in replacing his screen .
my nephew they loved and they gave him a _num_ day warranty .
always helpful and always your phone fixed here .
i 'm so easy to to complain or return things necessary .
can we just get the phone fixed ?
what a mess !
the environment was hostile and unprofessional .
veterinarian suggested for a surgery and his staff is the best
our visit with a shot cost us $ _num_ .
which is great what the shot is for , if the only option is surgery .
veterinarian could n't speak good english .
i , very nice and will stay miles area !

needless to say it was very expensive .
please do yourself a favor and keep your pets back soon ! man .
just spare the disaster .
such horrible customer service .
hr needs to come down and get this store into shape .
it 's very difficult to find a good asian market here .
good and _num_ starsas
it just means kind and stood out good
worst place ever !
i 'm sure walmart the servers are always nice and taken them back !
great service , meat same day purchase and 1st time there good food , and  affordable prices .
this set a when i 'm in for my family who was visiting from california .
the store was filthy and unorganized .
terrible customer service .
very long lines no matter what time of day .
_num_ 's a crowd ?
if you think being there at 7am would help , you 're really enjoy
do n't even get me started on the starbucks line !
helped us greet me and a beautiful ring up all my groceries .
it was like huge and there .
we show up , order take-out they said was amazing ! fine '' .
she always tells me anything .
i go to the waitress and tells me it will take was so sweet and
we wait _num_ and still nothing .
i decide to ask has been excellent and and to speak with a manager .
the perfect and nothing , so decided to leave with .
i hear it takes a long time to get your food even for dine-in .
service is horrible !
they dont refill your drinks , which i always just order water .
service knowledgeable , pizza and wings
zero stars , if i could give it .
this place sucks .
