he asked me to come back in , so they could install it .
if you want a nissan ( great cars , btw ) , go elsewhere .
instead i 'm there for over _num_ hours !
in other words , i was forgotten about and ignored yet again !
their finance department is shady and has no concept of customer service .
and the online customer service representative indicated , no one has contacted me .
no emails , no messages on my cell or at home .
i bought it after a terrible experience and drove it home .
boy was i wrong .
i was blatantly lied to because i made a huge stink about the warranty .
this is the worst i have ever been treated .
i would never go back to this place .
i said its my money , and could believe that if i wanted to .
this is the worst i have ever been treated .
i would never go back to this place .
i said its my money , and could believe that if i wanted to .
never did he fill me in on what was happening .
i insisted and again , he shut me down and would n't do it .
customer service sucks .
so i approached another person and he said oh let me get somebody .
they 're very rude here !
no apologies , nothing .
how rude .
this is not worth it .
pretty horrible customer service in the parts department .
pay for it only to notice _num_ minutes later it 's the wrong thing .
but they refuse to apply what i paid for the incorrect part .
are you bored ?
few better in vegas except maybe an urgent care on a holiday !
extra long waits and terrible service come included at no extra charge !
days like this i wish there was a _num_ star option .
this place is a ripoff .
always trying to make more money off of you .
they insisted the pads was low .
so be very careful if you decide to go there .
several friends had already warned me not to come to this place .
we paid for _num_ years of service , so i stuck with them .
except for the one in henderson , the rest of them are on sahara .
they replaced it _num_ months ago .
do not go to this dealership if you have a warranty .
the only technician i recommend is an old guy named ed .
my experience here has been consistently bad .
Negative
a very negative place with negative energy .
if a customer comes into the service area , you do n't ignore them .
this place needs to be shut down immediately .
one of the worst experiences in car buying .
it was almost like even talking to us was a waste of time .
this was around 10:30 am by 3pm we had not heard back .
it was like pulling teeth to get in touch .
i even tried to ask him questions and he just hung up .
i would highly recommend never going to autonation nissan .
since day one they have been regret than satisfaction .
never understood the purpose of having an appointment at the places .
poor customer service specially at maintenance side .
after _num_ hours , i did n't have the time or patience .
needless to say , i will never be going back here again .
monday dec _num_ i should have some information for you tomorrow afternoon .
dec _num_ tuesday he say this .
this is car buying at it 's absolute worst .
do not bother with these people .
save yourself a headache and go elsewhere .
i drove it for _num_ miles and it failed the smog check yet again .
he said , `` sorry , that 's just the way it is . ''
i drove it for _num_ miles and it failed yet again .
the parts department gentleman was very rude .
the register lady is n't the nicest either .
i do n't know what 's going on .
i noticed all associates here wearing name tags except him .
this was by far the worst experience i have ever had .
the finance person flat out lied to me , not once but twice .
`` the security + plus in no longer available `` lie number one .
it 's people like that that give used car salesman a bad name .
all in all a poor way to do business .
do n't believe me , talk to bob the service manager at autonation .
wo n't buy a car here again !
this is the worst place in the world .
got an accident and my car was total .
called about _num_ times always forward me to voicemail .
left about _num_ messages but no one ever call me back !
a disaster !
i just was n't comfortable buying from a picture .
they certainly were n't getting me the best deal .
we decided to go to the `` terrible '' dealership .
it was soo terrible !
i got a better car with more options and _num_ % financing to boot !
once you buy the car they do n't care about you !
terrible customer service from _num_ of the sales workers there .
my family and i had a horrible experience .
i went to get recall repairs done on my nissan .
for the same price that they charge you here for an oil change .
you can get a package of _num_ at planet nissan .
only giving one star cause i have to .
their sales team gets the _num_ star .
bad experience .
they were not able to help at all .
no one else had my keys and they do n't just fall off .
horrible experience with the chef .
never get what you order .
just sad .
i wish i had the service that everyone else was talking about .
took the mechanic all of _num_ seconds to tell him it was wrong .
he said that it was his fault for looking up wrong parts .
the problem with this statement ?
my brakes work fine , no thanks to this service shop .
and if you can , try to fix it yourself .
the pad thai here is n't bad .
however , i ca n't say much about the other stuff .
whatever my friend ordered was n't good at all .
the egg flower soup was just barely descent at best .
spent almost _num_ and a half hours there , entirely waiting for food .
there were about _num_ other tables being served , with about _num_ waiters total .
not a single word , apology or update on the speed of the food .
theirs was disappointing though .
not that great of a place .
it is quite a disappointment compared to other thai places .
first item of note was no brown rice .
when i arrived 10-15 minutes later i walked into a nearly empty restaurant .
i just wanted to let you all know how horrible it was !
please do not waste your time or money on this one !
did n't answer the phone the first time .
i 'll spend my money else where .
i have culinary insurance and am not supposed to be charged for paperwork .
i did not sign off to give out my personal medical information .
this place is a total dive ... it was messy and disorganized .
spend your money elsewhere .
not very nice .
bad tables .
had to tape up the legs so not to scratch floors .
and then forced me to return them the day after thanksgiving .
could n't keep for an extra day without being charged .
they let me keep the linens i rented until tomorrow with no problem .
do not trust these people .
try some place else !
customer service was friendly , unfortunately that was about all that was good .
$ _num_ on two chicken sandwiches plus value onion rings .
that and the seats looked like they have n't been wiped down in days .
customer service = _num_ stars .
cleanliness = _num_ star .
in my _num_ zip code , this was the highest rated burger king .
i got no response back .
gross .
worst drive through experience , will avoid this place at all cost .
rude and unprofessional workers , food was eh and fries were cold .
absolutely the worst burger king i have ever been to .
has terrible terrible service .
absolute minimum wait time .
and then when you do get your order ... chances are its wrong .
they are neither fast nor are they providing the food you request .
its the only business left open in the shopping center .
employees should shape up or prepare to be shut down .
wish i 'd gone that route .
if i could have gone back , i would have .
very rude , unprofessional .
horrible .
worst burger king ever !
rude !
oh , and no receipt .
bad service .
the manager lied about the price for a _num_ bedroom apartment .
do not live here.
it was after _num_ , and we were seated in the bar .
my apps were pretty gross deep fried average bar food .
the highlight for me was the beer .
to wash it down , i had an iced tea .
the nachos flavor was n't spectacular , it was bleh .
service is slow , and food has been average bar food .
also , do n't expect their seasonal beers to be on tap .
generally just not a great deal with average beers at best .
tonight was a total let down .
bad mistake !
if it ai n't broke do n't fix it !
thank goodness i used my coupon for $ _num_ off of our check !
but i went ( no choice , she was driving ) .
so , i chose the burrito .
the `` chipotle marinated '' pot roast was flavorless , chewy , and dry !
my friend was also disappointed .
get less , charge same ... no we have n't lost our memories .
no one wants to waste money on crappy food and a crappy atmosphere .
it was also smokey and loud in here .
the beer is just average .
the service was exceptionally slow .
when the food finally arrived two of the orders were wrong .
try installing at least one tv that is n't _num_ years old !
it feels old , and so is the staff .
i have eaten walleye at the sahara location every friday for _num_ years .
i 'm going to miss it .
the beer was my least favorite part of going to big dogs .
the servers at this particular location are terrible though .
they were n't even remotely busy .
had a few of them walk by us and did n't do anything .
i was anxious for the shanghai dumplings , which they did not have .
two of my favorites , and they were not available .
i also think it 's odd that they serve dim sum until _num_ pm .
now the pink decor has gone to crap .
i think i cut my inner lip chewing on the shrimp head .
i still cant believe that this place is so busy .
ive had to wait quite a while the last few times ive come here .
the curry puffs were ok , but nothing great .
wish i could have tried it _num_ years ago .
dim sum was mediocre if that .
go somewhere else for dim sum .
- you could taste how much effort they put into their food .
the pros were that the food came extremely fast after we ordered .
but that was only because one of their main rooms were opened .
the parking complex also sucked .
came here for dinner and the place is pretty dead .
would not waste my money here again .
the service was awful !
and even then ... we only got like _num_ selections !
the service was pretty bad too .
definetly not the best dim sum place i 've been to .
the shrimp balls became smaller and dryer ... wtf ... what a disappointment .
2nd time though kinda irritated me .
sticky fried rice with shrimp : horrible !
it tasted a week old and the shrimp was off too .
not very soft .
roasted duck over peanuts - nobody ate it .
they also ran out of different desserts too .
unless you like week old tasting food ... .
this place did not make it happen .
everything was too salty , tasted too old , or was n't steaming .
however , this restaurant has been not that great twice .
the flavors and taste are not that bad .
their dim sum is just too greasy for my taste .
it just they are too greasy .
another thing i did n't like about this place is the service .
but anyways , overall this place was mediocre at best .
probably wo n't go back .
i 've never even reviewed a place so low before !
i 'm really disappointed vegas !
usually service is horrible at dim sum , because its dim sum .
which is n't that bad .
it was disgusting !
also , our soy sauce bottle was empty !
it was cold .
dim sum is suppose to be hot .
but it was so cold , it was breaking apart .
horrible i tell you .
apparently they have _num_ late night menus .
apparently the english menu is much more in price .
i hate to give bad reviews but this place was definitely not good .
also i got sick to my stomach almost instantly after we finished eating .
not a good way to run a business .
worst service ever !
the worst dish was the sizzling pepper steak .
he immediately gets someone ( again ) to bring out soup .
bad service and bad food that day !
but it is for the low quality food .
but there were still many empty tables .
i would give them _num_ star for the service .
after the meal , i was so thirsty .
the food quality is way below the average .
there would be a line of people waiting outside to get seated for lunch .
the service is n't that great as said in many reviews prior to mine .
you should n't get cold dim sum around then .
so that was pretty disappointing .
it was my 1st time there and i was n't impressed .
= ( how lame !
gross .
we will not be back .
disgusting !
not to sure what has happened to this place .
the staff is rude and the dim sum is cold and tasteless .
this used to be our favorite dim sum place over the years .
flavorless , cold and some are rotten .
there is this older manager guy is extremely rude .
its very disturbing to see how he treats the dim sum ladies .
we visited on sunday , 8th of september and it would be our last .
the bad news , i got food poisoning .
there is a limited dim sum menu for night time .
still over priced for the dim sum offered .
service is still not the best but it 's typical for these establishments .
would not recommend .
this place is extremely slow .
tomato beef chow mein was pretty decent though .
?
and by skimpy , i mean only _num_ scallops .
they microwaved our dim sum in front of us .
depressing .
nothing more to stay .
we arrived around noon and they were n't too busy .
the highlights from our meal were the custard buns and crab balls .
if you like dim sum you must only go here for lunch .
dim sum is prepared fresh and brought out for you to choose .
it wo n't be fresh .
the food was good but everything except for the shrimp balls were cold .
this explains why .
disgusting !
obviously where there is one baby there is _num_ more .
sick sick sick .
they should be ashamed to even call this a dim sum restaurant .
all the food here is cold and greasy with absolute no flavor .
i do n't suggest coming here whatsoever .
after reading further reviews , i really question how they prepare the foods .
they are very slow .
only _num_ carts running with barely any dim sum .
the restaurant is n't even big !
because this restaurant is awful .
do n't let crappy food ruin your lunch/dinner like it did to mine .
dining here was an absolute wtf moment for me .
edible , but a little salt would have gone a long way .
the food aside , the piss poor customer service was criminal !
very average and greasy dim sum in a very loud and disorganized atmosphere .
cart ladies were hard to flag down .
plate of noodles we ordered were taken back to kitchen to be microwaved .
the food was cold .
they did not have all the usual items that they carry .
it was prime time ( 12:30 pm ) when we got there .
no reason for very limited choices .
we will not be going back .
worst dinner experience .
i am not going back there anymore to eat .
this place has officially closed .
slightly remodeled but you can barely tell .
i would n't recommend anyone to go here .
it took _num_ min and me asking again for our water .
they never even gave me a menu when i asked for one .
absolutely shut this place down does n't deserve be open .
do n't eat here .
this place is so disgusting .
worst experience ever .
my ac then stopped working _num_ weeks later .
it worked for about _num_ months until both units stopped working this past saturday .
he also topped off the larger one , as it is leaking .
this was on a previous review which does cause me some concern .
$ _num_ later , with no ac that properly works .
i woke up to an _num_ degree house .
my ac had stopped blowing cold air .
the guy could not figure out how to use my thermostat .
left a voicemail requesting a quote and did not receive a call back .
the first time he came out today was around _num_ am .
an hour after he left , it was not working .
i left a message , asking him to return my call .
i guess it would , since the a/c was blowing hot air !
he then opens my door and proceeds to tell me off !
apparently , when he and his a/c business agreed to fix my a/c .
did i mention it was _num_ degrees outside today in the las vegas desert ?
the next morning i waited til noon and she still did n't call .
she could not even narrow it down by _num_ hours .
we got it fixed within _num_ hours with another company .
absolutely no customer service or professionalism .
prices are too high as well .
i do n't know why i did n't get a second opinion .
two months later my pet died .
my cats would get sick every time after coming home from here .
they are strictly indoor cats .
also way over priced even on the half off days .
he said walk ins were welcome and informed me of the costs .
she then completely changed her attitude and attempted to assist me .
i am disgusted by her rude attitude .
she contacted our current vet to verify what shots were needed .
so that was the my request was to have that done .
she simply took his weight down , & placed us in a room .
went to check out and rang up a huge bill .
come back here nor recommend my family or friends or coworkers .
walking in , nobody greeted us , even though there was staff out there .
the nurse was very nice but the wait time was ridiculous .
they refused .
what a horrible experience .
first , he showed up _num_ min late due to `` traffic '' .
his lack of professionalism continued in the appointment .
still do n't have my answers .
bottom line , stay away from this place .
the staff was always rude ( both on the phone or in person ) .
look at their ratings on google , etc .
if you can go anywhere else , i suggest you do .
went here today to wash my car and the coin machine was not working .
no staff was onsite .
the chicken katsu was dry .
the roll and macaroni salad was bland .
it was watery and bitter .
convenience not worth the stop !
received my _num_ mustard dogs for $ _num_ , and went on my way .
it 's not .
drove off without ordering .
every time we would move , he would follow us .
he was so rude , so we just left .
i had to pass and it 's really the only reason i come back .
food was bad , service was terrible .
overall this was a dining experience gone terribly wrong .
i threw their hot sauce on it to make it a bit better .
the first cup of tea just tasted old .
i have never been here so i was excited .
im not a fan .
the sandwich was meh and i was just over this place .
do n't order a combo - it 's a ripoff .
this place is old and run down .
disgusting .
i never in my life have had any thing like this happen to me .
very rude receptionist .
you just lost a customer .
the building is dirty , not well maintained .
the office staff is terrible .
they do not follow up on lab work results or process referrals timely .
they also wrote the wrong diagnosis on my referral form .
when the doctor walked by , i asked , `` is this normal ? ''
i have gone there _num_ times to get _num_ referral processed .
this is ridiculous !
prepare to be poorly treated by their rude and billing staff .
the staff here is very rude and uncaring .
staff answering the phone 's are rude .
little to no eye contact .
do not waste your time .
just sent me off to the lab .
( i 'm going to try and use as few details as possible ) .
i 'm _num_ years old , so i 've had my share of them .
did n't give me a chance to get myself together or relax .
the camarones , too , were as tough as old leather .
was ok , not the best i 've ever had .
so , its like a sloppy joe with out the sloppy .
did not blow my skirt up .
would be _num_ % better if they used good n ' fresh buns .
this is not it .
i 'm left stunned with all the five star ratings with this joint .
i it like an la `` _num_ '' is a vegas `` _num_ ? ''
( quantity is not a problem here ) .
the verdict : disappointing .
for tacos , anyway .
phone operator was awful , not helpful and extremely rude .
would visit again in a pinch but will not schedule unless i have to .
cheap food and quality .
do n't go for you will get sick .
this place is the worst .
small menu , dining room closes at 7:30 pm not _num_ pm .
drive thru is open till _num_ .
food is ok , you get your greek craving .
gyro time sandwich - mediocre at best .
meat was not that tasty .
not greek style for sure .
this sauce was sour cream cucumber and some salt .
i am never coming back here .
( i just do n't like them on my sandwich . )
i could not believe it !
no no no .
this was not okay , gyro time , not okay !
bland and overpriced .
they were charging $ _num_ for a small cup !
you lost a customer .
every time i pass by this place , it 's busy .
everything about their service was mediocre .
to me this does n't seem like good business .
the manager was rude and very unprofessional .
i was very disappointed with my recent service .
i will not longer spend my lunch hour at this place !
the inside was pretty lousy .
fail .
i did n't want him near my car anymore , so i left .
zero , zero , zero .
do not go to this place .
waste of money and more importantly , time .
this place just messed up my all leather dash board .
slowest car wash in america .
only go there if you have an hour to wait .
do a decent job but takes way way too long .
ridiculous .
_num_ star for customer service of cashier .
she said i ca n't .
i ca n't do it in front of her .
it 's too late .
she said no it 's too late .
it 's $ _num_ .
she should know what 's hanging outside before she tells me wrong information .
that 's not a sign i would be looking for .
have n't gotten my car back yet so we will see how it is .
my other issue with this place is that they need a better cleaning crew .
it just does n't seem right .
i wish i did n't wait for _num_ hours to be seen .
and have the hot mess at the counter act like she does n't care .
this place is terrible .
ok turkey breast ?
it was n't even that good .
ate here many times as a kid .
the store in my neighborhood went under and the one on tropicana did too .
i felt like i was eating grease on grease on grease .
after coming here , why is my question .
first of all , i was looking for a chicken combo meal .
you know , a couple pieces of chicken , fries , and a drink .
they have a chicken combo but it does not come with a drink .
that 's not really a combo dude !
the turkey itself is a breaded patty and deep fried .
the fries it came with were dry and covered with a lot of salt .
sadly , it could not save those poor potato sticks .
might as well have been a piece of rubber and styrofoam .
i would not give this stuff to a starving homeless person .
that would be considered an insult .
farm basket ?
thick and soggy ... and tasteless !
just the worst piece of fried chicken i ever had .
i dare you to find an elementary school cafeteria that could produce worse .
even my girlfriend agreed , `` wow , this is bad '' .
... and i 've had better mashed potatoes lunchtime at a chinese buffet .
after having one on this visit , i must disagree .
not really .
i also fail to see the point of not dressing the sandwich .
i wish i could say the same about the food .
i agree with jamie p 's review ; the food is not quality .
the chicken seemed to be covered in uncooked batter , that was n't seasoned .
the new rolls are dry and do n't taste good with the glaze .
new management is turning farm basket upside down .
the sandwich was crispy but not tasty .
the mashed potatoes were instant and gravy was bland - i was very surprised .
we were so disappointed .
the mashed potatoes with gravy tasted like paste .
they are definitely instant potatoes , the gravy did n't help them much .
the coleslaw was pretty much just shredded cabbage with a little milk added .
thankfully we did n't pay full price because we threw most of it away .
i am not planning on returning .
a horrible waste of money , fries were hard , greasy and broken .
the `` crunchy '' chicken was more `` crunch '' than chicken .
awful , greasy and hard .
i 'm glad i purchased a groupon , and did n't pay full price .
gross .
we ended up throwing away half of the food .
are you kidding ?
tasted less than any fast food chain except at twice the price .
i guess people like going because it 's been there so long .
when i got them back , the lenses did n't seem right .
he will not stand by them if anything happens !
unfortunately in today 's world , good customer service is hard to find .
indeed they did , about _num_ of them , just behind a different fence .
apparently the first two guys did n't know this ... .
so we walk back and i pick out what i want .
if i could put zero stars i would .
went there to buy a shade tree .
spent $ _num_ there on one tree .
anyone whose been through this knows , it 's a pain .
crappy service , crappy plants , crappy experience .
but the sales people are way way too pushy .
where am i going to put another _num_ trees .
i always reserve online .
i 'm not the one who asked for the damn upgrade !
the car was nice , and the tank was half empty !
maybe next time i 'll call ahead to prepare them .
they have the worst costumer service ever .
they are very inconsiderate and unprofessional .
worst car rental ever , and i would not recommend this to anyone .
i just wasted _num_ hour and will be late now .
i booked my reservation with this location and i will never use them again .
needless to say , i went somewhere else and rented a car .
i will not use this location ever again .
i did n't want to leave any stars for this place .
the employees at this facility are beyond rude and unhelpful .
um , why do you refer them then ?
they did not greet any customers or thank them for their business .
but the interior of the car was nasty .
spoke to the manager and he was not accommodating told me the same thing .
mention there was no mud , just dusty water spots !
wtf im responsible for cleaning your cars now ?
worst experience ever !
do not rent from this location ( and hertz in general ) .
wish i could give less .
total was $ _num_ .
charge was $ _num_ .
did n't care .
they are the worse car company ever .
so this to _num_ people a day , and that is mass money lost .
the rice was undercooked and crunchy .
the orange chicken tasted like chicken nuggets .
chicken was also a little over cooked and pretty dry .
plus the noodles and rice suck !
no more !
ew , panda express is actually really bad .
idk if it was just this location but it was n't very good .
not mandarin or cantonese either but spanish ... really ?
just ordered black pepper chicken for $ _num_ .
very inconsistent with other panda express restaurants we 've had up here so far .
costumer service is bad as well .
if i could give this a total of _num_ stars , i totally would .
my advice to anyone wanting to eat at this panda express , do n't !
even the shanghai beef was not up to par .
two thumbs down .
got sick at this place twice .
i wrote off the first time to stuff happens and placed no blame .
came back a month later same thing happened .
i will not be going back ever .
sadly i may not go back , since subway is just as close .
the chicken pasta was pink !
my husband had the chicken caesar wrap and a side of salad .
the food was okay but it 's nothing i would crave for .
i wish i would have taken the move on advice in this case .
the ribs were tough , the chicken was a little dry .
maybe i just caught them on a bad day .
very dry chicken .
not very tasty .
for a chicken caf , they really do n't do chicken that well .
their vegetables are ok , but it 's not called nevada vegetable caf .
these just did n't taste right .
kind of wish they would put another restaurant in rotation .
but again , this is n't called nevada spinach feta cheese pasta caf .
seriously - find chicken elsewhere .
it was a huge wrap , but not very tasty .
the baked beans and potatoes salad were not very good either .
i regret not having just plain chicken or ribs .
i could never sit through that again .
it would have been better to have it off .
just mediocre .
i do n't know why anyone would eat here .
garlic ranch sauce they have at the salsa bar is disgusting .
i wo n't even bother using the other one .
if i could give this place less than _num_ star i would .
blown away by the response and tone he directed towards me i patiently waited .
with a very nasty attitude she said `` uh huh '' .
the white meat was very dry .
the seasoning on the chicken was too salty .
not worth going back .
my wife drives by this place all the time .
the smell and smoke brought us in and we were so disappointed .
absolutely the worst bbq i ever had .
the mashed potatoes tasted like instant .
the ribs were dry and rough .
no refund of anything .
i said no to their nasty sides .
_num_ bucks down the drain .
i ate there about _num_ months ago and again it was just blah .
never going back .
slow as hell .
_num_ people working in the back and _num_ customer in the lobby and me .
not worth the wait .
again sorry for your bad experience and looking forward to see you soon ... .
the only way you could improve is as i suggested .
_num_ .
_num_ .
seats that can support a child ( bare minimum ) .
_num_ .
_num_ .
they let people sit in broken seats ?
worst food ever !
big mistake !
the pulled pork was dry and leather texture , impossible to chew .
never will i recommend nevada chicken cafe !
used the yelp _num_ for _num_ deal .
first , the chicken was dry , specially the chicken breast .
we got mixed fruits , corn , mac n cheese , and caesar salad .
the second time i ate there after purchasing the yelp coupon .
it was then that i noticed the place has small roach problem .
i was addicted to their wings and would stock up on them regularly .
are actually kind of insulting .
their posted business hours are until _num_ pm at night .
i walked in and was told they were closed !
the lady just said no were closed !
being turned away is the worst feeling , and should never have happened .
meh , i 've had better .
so i ordered a _num_ piece chicken meal with _num_ sides .
the potatoes were cold and the macaroni tasted like water .
in addition the chicken was dry .
i actually ended up getting very sick after eating their food .
both of them tasted like cafeteria food .
i exchanged them for the bbq beans and the coleslaw which were definitely better .
the only thing impressive about this cafe was the mesquite grill .
and oh , there were bones in my chicken wrap .
never going back .
i 'm writing this and i have n't even tasted the food yet .
this was the first time i have been to `` nevada chicken cafe '' .
the experience was nothing special .
there is nothing in the box but chicken !
what idiots are working there ?
how a restaurant manages to stay so filthy , so frequently is beyond me .
this leads me to the main problem with this restaurant .
all of it is bland .
i think thats why i constantly go back .
i 'm finally done letting you ruin my meals .
fuck nevada chicken cafe .
the wait time alone is a turn off !
if the half chicken meals are this small i could eat _num_ chickens then .
any other chicken restaurant out there would probably be better than this place !
how can you burn chicken that bad ?
i ordered the family _num_ meal and it was terrible .
mashed potatoes ?
husband was not happy .
we finally tried it today and we were very disappointed .
full chicken , rack of ribs , and three sides .
the chicken was dry .
the ribs were okay ... tasted like they were boiled .
and the sides were mediocre .
the family meal was $ _num_ .
food was mediocre .
went to the nevada chicken cafe off of rainbow blvd .
i was unfortunately disappointed with this location .
first of all it was so noisy !
the food was n't as good as the sahara location .
the last time i did n't even need butter it was so good .
i do n't get why she did n't do that .
tips are n't guaranteed .
so it 's 5:30 on a friday and no ribs !
wtf , _num_ minutes til they have any .
so i ordered the chicken and _num_ sides .
did n't really want chicken but oh well .
i go to the condiments and both bbq sauce bottles are empty .
a real disappointment , i 'll let you know how the chicken was .
_num_ minutes later they refilled the bbq sauce , lol .
this place is horrible !
do n't go here the service and food sucks .
my coworkers and i tried it out just the other day .
first , i must say there customer service skills were bad .
the food was warm and they failed to bring all of our orders out .
to make a long story short stay away from this place .
this individual has zero professionalism managing employees .
let me tell you something you are not on tv .
what to i see ( not to my surprise ) mr .
may i suggest a future more fitting career change , prison guard .
right off the bat this place was annoying .
yeah , i probably wo n't go back .
normal gas looking grill , back is surrounded by a brick wall .
next to that cart is the soda fountain with pepsi products .
our experience : the place was empty except for _num_ tables had people there .
i got the chicken breast , wing , 1/4 rib combo .
luckily we had a coupon because that was $ _num_ .
our coupon brought it down to $ _num_ .
no bbq on the meat .
i did n't taste a flavor of a spice rub either .
the combos came with a little salad and one flour tortilla .
for my side i got mashed potatoes and gravy .
there was barely any gravy on the potatoes .
it was really bland and not cheesy .
pricey for just _num_ pieces of rotisserie chicken .
girl a the register had an attitude looked like she hated her job .
costumer service was horrible not a single person was smiling in that place .
food was horrible !
then i sat and waited over _num_ minutes .
she saw it dripping and did nothing about it .
she stood it up between a counter and cabinet just behind the register .
then slammed it into place with her butt .
my watermelon came out of the same container after her hands were in it .
_num_ ribs does not make half a rack .
there was no extra to compensate for the lack of ribs .
the mashed potatoes were ok .
i always want to like this place , but usually end up disappointed .
customer service sucks .
food also is n't as well prepared as it used to be .
i did n't like the food they offered .
the mashed potatoes taste gross .
and price is expensive .
i will not returned or recommend this place to my friends and family .
this place used to be good now they are terrible .
i wo n't be coming back .
isnt the health dept supposed to prevent stuff like this ?
so , that is why there is a health dept .
we went for the ribs on saturday evening at _num_ pm .
they just changed our order without asking .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
very skinny chicken .
so so so disappointed .
garlic ranch and the salsa flavors to be exact .
as for customer service , the staff seems friendly .
but that is not my business .
we tried and failed .
the work is below standard !
hands down , the most misleading radio station name i have ever heard .
this is not a mix station , it is a modern pop station .
most of the show is n't even content from the hosts .
they are far too lazy to do their actual jobs .
they are dishonest and lie too .
and the _num_ reps gave me different dates .
i instantly put a lock on my social security number .
idiots work here !
these people are ridiculous .
they even sent me a receipt showing paid in full .
tired of this week do our part but these collection services never do theirs !
terrible service from this hobby store .
done shopping here .
too bad joey left , the place has gone down hill ever since .
not one offered any explanation of the procedures and or rules of the facility .
almost two hours after my father was placed .
it 's not like there was n't time nor opportunity .
do not send a loved one here .
this place is full of incompetent people .
bad news !
and many have very bad attitudes .
do n't send your loved one here .
i am piss 'd !
i 'm gon na tell my friends to quit eating this garbage !
lady rude would n't let me return lotion smelled disgusting for a dollar .
no receipt .
terrible customer service .
Neutral
if i could give this store negative stars i gladly would .
waste of money and time .
awful customer service .
then she followed me to another aisle .
do n't waste your time .
i 'm so disappointed with the staff .
also ca n't do the deal taco survey cause of no receipt .
disgusting .
service sucked the entire time .
avoid at all costs .
going to be wearing this horror show around for quite a few weeks .
worst starbucks i have ever been in !
she makes eye contact with me then looks away !
after standing there for _num_ minutes , ( felt like _num_ ! )
if i did n't need that coffee , i would have just walked out !
avoid this crap box at all costs !
its not busy yet it took awhile to receive just my black tea ... .
manager was polite and assisted with my short n simple order .
the worst starbucks i have been to !
i have been here many times and each time it has been bad .
the drive thru is horrendous and going inside was n't much better .
we went through the drive thru and had the worst experience .
i will not return to this starbucks !
this starbucks has really went down in the last 4-5 months .
never same staff and drink consistency is horrible .
i wish starbucks would pay attention to yelp .
i see a lot of unhappy customers in the last few months .
maybe time for management change turn it back around .
worst starbucks in las vegas .
i already heard bad things about this starbucks but decided to try it out .
needless to say two bad experiences are two to many .
not sure what happened but it is n't good .
i am waiting just ice coffee _num_ minutes .
now , not much customers are here .
everything else about this place is a dump .
the barista told me she could give me coffee with room for cream .
a knowledgeable staff they are not & quite rude about it .
i will no longer be going to the one closest to me .
worst starbucks ever .
long wait times and unfriendly baristas .
ridiculous !
not today , however .
wish u had other options around here for expensive coffee .
had beyond the worst customer service at this location .
this starbucks is the worst !
when i got to the window , she gave me hot mocha !
this is n't the first time either .
taking my business somewhere else .
the front office , with one exception , is awful .
while the apartments are alright , they 're certainly not worth the price .
chapel hill apartments are horrendous .
i signed a lease for _num_ year in the apartment .
i realized _num_ days later i would be moving out of state .
long story short $ _num_ dollars .
this is the worst apartment i 've ever lived in .
management is a complete joke .
my neighbors are the worst people i have ever met .
do not consider this place !
go somewhere else !
not an honest staff would n't recommend these apartments .
always wait to see the unit before signing .
stayed for _num_ months , bought a house .
however , i did n't get my security deposit back .
the money means nothing to me , it 's the principle .
avoid at all costs .
well , this was not the case at all .
our bills continued to sky rocket , as well as our frustration .
my god , i do n't even know where to begin with them .
easily put , they were the rudest , most inconsiderate , obnoxious individuals ever .
we thought the last neighbors were horrible , yeah right .
we quickly made our decision .
it was just so pushy and annoying .
this woman was just so confused it was ridiculous .
simply put , avoid this place at all costs .
it 's not worth it .
so today me and my husband are looking for a place .
given we all have out bad days at work .
maybe he was having a bad day and just did n't care at all .
maintenance is not done in a timely manner .
even issues like heat in the dead of winter are ignored after several requests .
some neighbors are very loud but no one will do anything about it .
this place is over priced for the facility amenities and service you 'll receive .
horrible place to rent to !
they are so unprofessional i 'm a little appalled .
disappointed .
however , can we say major disappointment with the employee working .
when she finally decided to greet me she was very rude .
i advised i was interested in a two bedroom model .
now , this was said with a major attitude .
i mean it 's a wait and i am the only employee here !
this was so unprofessional and rude !
at this point i lost all interest and left .
nothing to be done about that , just something they do n't advertise .
i accidentally left some items in the truck .
of course ... but not the point .
no wonder everyone is fat .
get my coffee , and it 's half full .
tell me why i did n't get any hot and spicy ?
only gave it one star because the place was clean .
worst mcdonald 's i have ever been to .
i never write bad reviews but i have to let this one out .
it 's pretty ridiculous .
as always .
late night there is a problem .
tonight was cash only .
which is the 3rd time this has happened to me at this location .
not caring about service because they have you addicted .
_num_ % of time i am disappointed with this location .
the service person rang me up for a small soda .
then i realized that i had a soda cup .
i went back to the counter and asked for my coffee .
i looked at my receipt and realized he charged me for a small soda .
but she said nothing .
i can not believe i am the first to review this wal-mart location .
avoid it at all costs .
sucks .
parking is awful too !
for some reason this one does n't .
i decide to ask another worker next to the paper towels .
i leave and attempt to ask another worker .
yet , for some reason they could n't communicate using the english language .
i am now extremely irritated .
now , i was really pissed .
but , it was a stupid one .
she said that walmart does n't sell phone cards .
is it the poor public schools ?
i absolutely can not stand walmart .
the employee 's are miserable , the customers are a lot to be desired .
it 's always messy and seems unclean .
there is a weird `` walmart '' smell .
ugh , just dont like it .
the cashier apparently told her it was ok .
this store has gone south in its cleanliness in the produce department .
i would have taken some pics but my phone is broken .
not enough employees at this location .
not my normal location .
nothing happened after _num_ minutes .
after waiting on hold another _num_ minutes , i was promptly disconnected .
the only reason i even go here is because of proximity .
it 's dirty , unorganized & the workers hate being there.
i went in by myself to get it done , they were very friendly .
so we went back my dad had explained why he 's angry .
they did n't take fault for what they did wrong .
very poor service .
manger , then manager told me to beat it .
after he walked away from me .
is _num_ cents savings per dollar worth it .
my girl and i already went to a few stores with no luck .
apparently he just was n't in the mood that night .
it 's always cheap place to shop .
i am not a big fan of walmart .
never have been and never will be .
baby food which is cheaper here than at an organic market .
anyways , i have n't been at walmart in ages .
bad mistake .
i would avoid coming here on the weekends if possible .
on may 8th i went inside to pickup my prescription .
this store needs major work , not in its appearance but in its service .
check outs are a nightmare !
unbelievable .
the pharmacy department here is useless .
i am told _num_ minutes .
why was not told that to begin with ?
i was a bit disappointed with the customer service .
two star for finally doing it after wasting my time .
it always feels dirty and depressing in there .
once you walk in it goes down hill .
this is just an fyi .
if i could give zero stars i would .
below wal-mart standards .
you have lost me as a customer .
very inefficient and very bad customer service .
if you want to waste time , go to this store .
but here in vegas , walmart is a typical place to go ?
my main gripe about this place is that it is humongous .
half of them do n't have a clue where the products are located .
little did she know who she was dealing with .
a lot of items do n't even have prices .
if there are no prices posted , i wont buy it .
does n't have any manners .
very rude and has a serious hostile attitude !
there 's about _num_ ppl working but only _num_ cashier ?
i will be making any clothing purchases elsewhere thanks to this greedy policy .
another failed attempt and waste of my time !
i will never go to any walmart to buy any type of paint !
never will i be back .
not even for store credit .
so you will get turned away .
within _num_ minutes we were already in for $ _num_ .
i could n't get a shot to save my life !
there was some girl working the bar that had absolutely no personality whatsoever .
others at bar just sitting and not playing .
the other bartender did not even say a thing to us .
anyway , we paid , left a smaller tip and left .
i personally am not a fan of the lodge .
only giving a _num_ star rating because they changed the chicken enchilada soup .
wow , worst bar service ever .
ill give her and the kitchen _num_ stars .
the only reason we used to come here every week was for the food .
i wish i could put zero stars but it wont let me .
worst service i have ever had .
the graveyard bartender was miserable and would n't acknowledge anyone at all .
holy crap , this place is horrible !
worst food i 've had in vegas .
this place is terrible !
save your money and go somewhere else where you are appreciated !
horrible .
sorry , wo n't ever be back .
horrible .
food service was good but the bar service was terrible .
we could n't get drinks and the place was empty which is pretty bad .
the food was average , nothing over the top .
nothing sized medium ) .
would a refund have been so difficult ?
your fairways are thin with grass and mostly made of mud .
save your hard earned money and avoid this place .
it really ruined the entire experience for us .
not really but ok .
the smell of sewage was every where .
then he tried to charge me $ _num_ .
at least in the front _num_ .
recently they had a management change .
take your wedges because it is generally driver , short iron wedge type course .
worth at the most for _num_ holes $ _num_ to $ _num_ a round .
horrible customer service ... .
the staff do n't even communicate the correct information with each other either .
totally changed my perspective on this golf course .
wish i could give jeff _num_ stars and the course _num_ stars .
pathetic that they would lose a long time loyal customer over $ _num_ .
worst managed course in the city .
terrible service .
you lost my patronage forever .
play here _num_ days a week for past two years .
all new faces no familiar faces ... starting area changed , not comfortable .
lost customer service appeal .
the greens are consistently horrible .
it 's too bad because the location is great .
alas , i came in too late for breakfast .
shit poor latte , served in a cappuccino cup .
today they ruined it for me .
first off , they failed to prepare our office 's phone in order .
could n't even find that we had placed , and paid for !
service is hit or miss .
panera , please do n't hire people who do n't want to be here .
disgusting .
problem is , it 's hardly ever good .
i am not exaggerating and its not just sometimes , it is every time .
i get my order and `` the entire store is out of bread '' .
the store overall just had a very unprofessional atmosphere which was irritating .
absolutely horrible service , food , iced chai tea latte , and cinnamon roll .
my _num_ year old son compared the cinnamon roll to the one at school .
clark county school district cinnamon rolls taste the same as yours ?
this time the bread was super hard and the steak was tasteless .
i will never be back .
walked back and was given back the chips with an apology .
by the time i get home i noticed the bag was wet and dripping .
all he said was `` oh sorry about that '' with an uncaring attitude .
all in all , terrible customer service today .
i guess it 's just a hit or miss coming to this location .
unfortunately i did n't have a great experience with this location .
crazy how busy this location was for a tuesday afternoon .
its basic safe ground for your picky eaters .
was not so impressed with this particular location .
they did n't even bother to cut my bread in half .
they just ripped a chunk off the loaf .
tables were dirty , floors had trash , trash cans were over flowing .
natalie did n't hook me up like that .
we ordered two soups , bread , mac n cheese , and two cookies .
what a disappointment .
it was a total disaster in there !
seriously , painful to watch chaos .
it was really bad !
so the week following , i placed a smaller lunch order for my crew .
they ca n't find the order , and said they never received it .
they can not seem to get their act together with large orders .
someone needs to go in and help this location , they are broken .
third , the turkey & bacon sandwich had no flavor what so ever .
it 's super slow and no one else is in line !
even after i complained no one apologized or fixed my order .
ordered an asian sesame chicken salad to go .
salad wasnt as good as it usually is because it was missing cilantro .
no one here i 'm waiting waiting .
never again , panera .
food not good ... .
taste like frozen food , bread is cold and hard like a rock .
do n't know if going back again !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the sandwich looked nothing like the poster .
_num_ .
the sandwich was cold .
too expensive for the mediocre food .
the turkey was horrible ) .
i do n't know if i 'll go back .
last couple times i 've gone here have been nothing but crappy .
just let down after let down .
what a waste of money !
ripoff !
if there 's a zero rating here that 's my rate to this restaurant .
the fried rice smelled so bad .
i called the store to inform them that the rice was no good .
are you kidding me ?
what a disappointment !
i also ordered two side chicken egg rolls .
th broccoli beef was no where to be seen .
i checked through the bag again and there was nothing .
the park lunch was n't as relaxing after this incident .
i was disappointed .
my lasagna was incredibly dry .
nothing special .
crust was nothing special , neither the presentation or toppings .
the service was incredibly slow , the servers inattentive .
life is too short for bad italian food !
plus , it was n't too far away from my house .
did n't think much of it at the time .
payment being due at time of pick up .
i mean really , really bad .
and no , it was n't from me !
later i noticed that my entire closet had that horrible smell .
: ( ugh !
for this reason , i wo n't be returning .
i seriously ca n't believe that this place has a _num_ star rating .
sorry yelpers , i am disappointed with you all about this one .
located on tropicana and fort apache , behind mcdonald 's .
very rude .
terrible !
poor service .
she blended one side of my beard into my hair but not the other .
if i could give this place less than _num_ star i would .
the first year was ok but the apartment and appliances need updating .
ac does n't work well and the door handles are terrible .
doors are thin and get holes easily .
there was a lot of noise , drugs , and the place was filthy .
the office refuses to help .
the people in the office are rude and condescending .
they do n't want to help you and do n't respond to issues .
overall a terrible place to live .
would not recommend .
the management is horrible .
nothing is ever organized .
also the security is horrible , only one guy is constant .
the other one seems slow .
i said yes , and he was like whats my apt .
bad idea !
the `` staff '' seem dangerous .
i wish i could give less stars .
_num_ .
_num_ .
got broken into , they never fixed the window they broke in at .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
people do n't care .
always talking crap in spanish thinking people do n't understand .
requested several things to fixed nothing yet .
meh , my filet was overcooked , service was slow .
if you 're looking for a good steakhouse , look elsewhere .
the pictures came out looked washed and unprofessional .
nearly half of the prime rib my boyfriend ordered was fat .
wo n't eat here again and i do n't suggest anyone else to .
then came the entrees , which were less impressive .
i ate about _num_ oz worth before setting it aside .
merlot is all that i remember .
too bad .
the proximity to the show is the only thing going for it .
the casino , bathrooms , shops were dirty ... very dirty .
we were advised we should arrive _num_ mins before our reservation .
our food was very mediocre and my meat was very overcooked .
she said she would be back .
well service was slow and we started getting anxious to get to the show .
i guess i was wrong !
the only thing that i thought was great were the salads & the asparagus .
so my boyfriend and i went to las vegas for vacation .
i called to make reservations , and we were set .
upon arrival the hostess station seemed very unprofessional and unorganized .
like a white trash wedge .
the lobster was not fresh , definitely frozen .
our bill was $ _num_ .
so unprofessional and rude .
well what a waste of time that was .
in fact , santa monica city college is better than unlv .
i suggest getting an online degree over unlv .
this time i did not take action .
many students i knew cheated regularly .
depending on your major , if you can afford to go elsewhere , do .
`` , and then he says , `` chinese huh .
and hockey does not exist .
except for _num_ weeks in february .
also , the instructors have been told to not accept scratch paper .
the only competent instructor i have for fall _num_ is my chinese _num_ teacher .
it was absolute shit .
weeks later he disrespected me again in front of the entire class .
after this incident i could not let it go .
i left unlv after a couple of years .
i have absolutely no respect for this school .
i do n't understand why this institution was even built in the first place .
it 's not that hard to maintain an `` a '' average either .
just skip breakfast and your shower and just get to campus .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
idk how .
but the worst of them all are the noisy people that bring in food .
bring some dry food , in containers .
the only quiet people are the foreign students .
the parking situation sucks , but what can you do about it ?
point is just do n't buy into this place .
do n't waste your time like i 'm about to .
find like minded people , and avoid the idiots .
do n't buy the merchandise really not worth it .
they are dead on !
mind you , its _num_ degrees outside ; i head in that direction .
very irritating .
worst school organization system ever !
seriously , the prices are almost twice what they should be .
what a way to ruin the entire trip to vegas .
poor business practice !
everything about this place was terrible .
it was _num_ degrees inside and smelled like old grease .
they turned it into deep fried beef jerky .
terrible .
it was terrible .
why not give us less , but make it better .
i will never go again and advise you to avoid .
did n't understand i wanted the lunch special and not the lunch plate .
place is run down .
it came with fried shrimp , an eggroll and some cream cheese rangoons .
the kung pao chicken was a huge disappointment in that it was mostly celery .
the ginger onion beef was a little bit better but not by much .
it had more green onion and strips of ginger than there was beef .
the fried rice was very greasy and did not have much flavor .
it did not taste fresh .
there are so many better options for chinese food in las vegas .
price is reasonable but taste is underwhelming .
i ordered the szechuan chicken lunch special with fried rice .
rice was dry and everything overall had a processed taste .
got mongolian beef w fried rice and two egg rolls today .
the mongolian beef was really mongolian onions and peppers .
there was hardly any beef at all .
especially for $ _num_ .
the meal should have had atleast four times the amount of beef .
i will not be going back .
there was no sauce .
for some reason people really ca n't drive over here .
but i have just been having the worst of luck with the pharmacy .
i get a text message saying my prescription is ready for pick up .
sorry we left out rv there .
could n't complain to office because management quit and not a person around .
you 'll be sorry if you store anything there .
hardly picks up phone never calls back rarely is there ... .
i went to this place last saturday after reading all the great reviews .
i was greatly disappointed by this place .
it 's not right at all .
there are never enough registers open .
there `` _num_ 's a crowd '' is bs .
then , they did n't even know what came with the meal !
poor service .
anyway , i will never shop here again .
i wasted my money on that shit .
poor service .
inappropriate employees .
terrible customer service .
only _num_ lanes open and no self check open .
long lines and slow .
worst food and service ever !
waitress never brought water and the shrimp plate i ordered had small shrimp .
it was all sauce , rice and beans .
had the enchilada tour , and they were the best i ever ate .
i miss not being able to get queso and tamales .
with an expanded menu , this would easily be _num_ stars .
the food was ok , but nowhere near the quality of our last visits .
overall , we were very disappointed and wo n't go back .
this place is horrible .
the lady who cut his hair was so rude .
very unprofessional , i have no idea how anyone can stand these people .
this place is horrible .
the lady who cut his hair was so rude .
very unprofessional , i have no idea how anyone can stand these people .
left after _num_ min .
salons should at least have _num_ stylists especially on weekends .
today it was the worst .
we will not be going back .
there is no customer service stay away !
i was disappointed .
idk , he did n't or really could n't explain , language issues .
hmm , i was laughing to myself after the phone went dead .
the service at this pizza hut is horrible .
well , so if you like pizza , do n't get it from here .
it certainly was n't fresh bacon .
when the food came out , the plate of chicken tenders was huge .
chicken tenders and fries : no bueno .
bowl of chili : blah blah blah .
the flatbread was cold and hard .
not worth a penny .
super lame .
service was horrible .
it was just ok .
our service was absolutely horrible .
the food is bad , even for bar food .
the service is also bad , another problem .
dining area was almost empty and we had to constantly look for our waitress .
i would n't recommend it , too many other better options .
bad cooking skills .
afraid to eat it , i drove all the way back .
offered to replace but my appetite is ruined .
i wo n't be back .
wish i could include the video i took .
it was gross .
thanks for trying though .
staff is rude .
i had a beer which was good but hard to screw that up .
it looked way too dark .
it was straight dark rum and a splash of pineapple .
wo n't be back .
i walked in and it was not very busy .
so i finally put a _num_ into a machine .
it was the only way to get someone to do anything .
fail .
be sure to check your bill .
i like to be in charge of how much i tip .
this place is like a cave .
no windows , dim lighting , reeks of stale smoke .
no one to great you when you walk in .
i do n't even know what to say except just go somewhere else .
filter broke in february _num_ .
_num_ months , no update .
about _num_ weeks prior , i get worried .
_num_ stars if possible .
worse place ever !
i 'm not sure who the receptionist is , but she is horrible .
worst customer service i ever experienced !
i showed up just before my appointment time and was greeted by the receptionist .
obviously i wo n't be going back .
i am _num_ years old and i am no where near grey !
i could n't believe this .
i will never go back and i do not recommend anyone else to go .
honestly wish this could have been _num_ star .
impatient so asked for an appointment w/ a stylist trained by penny .
one side was left longer and more full than the other side , etc .
i also told reception that i review on yelp so gave fair warning .
am i high maintenance ?
obviously they do not care .
my point is , do i understand that things happen ?
the second time is totally unacceptable .
pathetic .
worst haircut ever .
normally it takes about _num_ minutes to cut my hair .
not picky but you do have to listen to the customer .
she clearly knew i was n't happy and blamed it on the products .
my haircut was not worth that much !
i do n't remember ... a while back .
... it 's not always the cleanest either .
i really considered turning around and going back but gave up on the thought .
and guess what no bbq sauce but an open ketchup packet that got everywhere .
and this is why i rarely eat fast food .
, she calls out for a chocolate shake , too .
yep , i guess she 's feeling better !
seems high to me .
the filet of fish was ok at best .
which i have n't eaten in probably _num_ years and regretted it then .
it 's so gross !
used the drive thru , there was hardly a wait .
thankfully the shake did n't taste like the smell of the store .
it 's a gas station mcdonald 's !
the smell of urine is simply unappealing .
lame .
i want to pay real money for this !
and afterward , i want to gas up my car , yup !
_num_ r e al z .
the girl at the cashier did n't even make eye contact .
it 's not the customers fault that the employees are unhappy .
will not visit this location again !
slow unfriendly service surprisingly from a mcdonald 's .
shame on the workers who passed this out .
every time i ask for something it is a fail !
shame on the workers who passed this out .
gas light on !
i get technology sucks sometimes .
like i said , i get technology sucks , but stay calm .
advice to management , teach your employees stress management .
this was the worst car service and oil change experience i have ever had .
they cost me more money in repairs .
they supposedly had checked all of the tire pressure and changed the oil .
very unhappy with our first visit .
received _num_ beers on play .
( _num_ ) or original play .
we have never been treated like that before .
we ordered a couples drinks , $ _num_ for _num_ cocktails .
nothing `` dive bar '' about this place .
none of that here .
it kind of remind me of being home .
i quickly found out that this is not right .
i have had the worst experience with them .
i was becoming extremely confused and frustrated .
uh not gon na happen .
total bill $ _num_ .
its now two days later and the gel is off .
he put the gel over my cuticles !
ridiculous !
i highly doubt ill b back .
however , do not give them your contact details .
i assume she was on commission .
then a couple of weeks ago , i got a call asking for money .
and i hate saying that .
why so bad ?
he too , had no clue what was going on .
but there was so much going on , i barely realized this happened !
terrible services .
i got bored w it quickly .
not quite sure how it could be improved .
to be honest , i 'm completely confused by these positive reviews .
it kind of brings dirt cheap to a whole new meaning for me .
and the food just was n't very good at all .
we did n't finish our meals .
maybe we just had a bad experience ?
they do n't have cheese all they have is this disgusting liquid cheese .
our waitress was so rude !
it was so bland .
therefore , we were glad that we have this place .
they know how to under cook and burn potatoes at the same time .
cheap , yes .
i was told that the burgers come with lettuce , tomato , and onion .
the onion rings were dried out and had no flavor , also from frozen .
i ordered an omelet with toast and hashbrowns .
when our meals came out , everything on my boyfriends plate was cold .
the eggs were overcooked and somehow even the bacon was gross and cold .
i do n't really consider those to be real cheese .
my food was not very good overall either .
the toast was cold and the hashbrowns had no flavor .
confusing .
there was _num_ of us .
it was awful .
she just stood there like ... you really didnt get your food ?
terrible service , terrible food .
waited forever for uncooked eggs and did n't even get everything we ordered .
they also charge $ _num_ for a service call .
keep shopping around my friends as this is n't the place to go .
i have bought appliances here several times .
no show , no call .
after a month my dishwasher still does not work .
ate lunch here one day and the burger was solid , beer was cold .
kind of a shame , because i like the place .
but the service was what really left an impression on us .
no check up , no `` anyone need another drink , '' nothing .
the food was totally forgettable ; the service was terrible .
no real atmosphere here .
it was pretty bland , as was the food .
on a scale of 1-10 i give my bloody mary a _num_ .
come to find out they have a dining room next door .
the third shift was _num_ people who 'd ordered omelets .
i would n't have noticed much if it was by a few minutes .
you 're usual run of the mill , musty smelling bar .
very slow service in an empty restaurant , average food .
if you 're going for food and/or mixed drinks , do n't .
he told me he did n't know , and went to check .
i admit , i am a somewhat `` particular '' customer .
my second sandwich had american cheese and swiss cheese on it .
i 'm sorry , but i definitely do not like this place .
my wife and i showed up at 5:30 for dinner before a 7:00 movie .
it went downhill from there .
my daughter and i being the only _num_ people in the dinning area .
ran as a _num_ $ drink and it just tasted like juice .
yet it was a _num_ $ dinner .
the server was terrible .
overall shitty experience , bland food and overpriced menu .
waited _num_ minutes at a dirty table and no server ever came .
after a recent visit , it looks like ownership has changed .
the buffalo chicken dip was edible , but not all too great .
the pulled pork was n't bad , but was n't great either .
the shrimp was soggy and the fries use to be fresh cut .
i was not overly impressed .
a bartender myself , i thought the drinks were awful .
none of them were made properly ; there were multiple bartenders .
so i can not say what the food is like .
in that case , i 'd stick to beer .
total dive bar , pretty smokey , pool tables in the back .
the second time , however , made it clear i 'd never order again .
which would n't have been a huge deal had they not been bone dry .
got a meatball sub and fries for take out .
not the best sub i 've ever had , but not the worst .
wo n't be ordering from here again .
way too greasy and just okay tasting .
sucked , ordered a bbq chicken sicilian pizza and they gave me a regular .
there was no bbq sauce in it .
the seafood calzone had more bread and grease then actual meat .
no more from me .
the mozzarella cheese sticks were not cooked and taste horrible .
the buffalo chicken was completely gross and the chicken was cold as ice .
the pizza lacked flavor , cheese was cheap with opened canned tomato sauce .
we 've been ordering from here for at least five years .
we should have picked it up , i 'd be in bed by now .
there are so many better places in the area , especially bloomfield .
they were decent , i did n't have a problem with them at all .
but the service was horrible .
we have ordered from this terrible place more than once .
mushy and tasteless , covered in tasteless doughy stuff .
gross !
for some reason , my boyfriend decided to order from them tonight .
added _num_ toppings to the calzone ( pepperoni , mushrooms , broccoli ) .
no toppings !
literally just sauce and cheese .
i am not usually the one to complain .
i really felt like i had wasted $ _num_ .
we always tip them $ _num_ , and they are literally _num_ blocks away .
the man on the phone was so completely rude !
they did n't call grub hub , who also could 've called me .
he just said `` too bad '' and kept talking over me .
they just delivered the worst meal when we are freaking starving !
she said she was calling them and they gave us a $ _num_ credit .
boo this garbage pizza place !
unfortunately , they ruined it for me as they have _num_ customer service .
it was smashed up and looked like lasagna .
so for now , i 'm going with _num_ .
ok , whatever .
it really made me wonder if they ever think about fire codes .
and miserable to get up and move .
and finally , only in pa , you can still smoke in here .
that alone makes me want to stay away .
it 's still miserable !
terrible food and service .
some definite problems as a venue .
often difficult to see the stage .
server was rude and gave us attitude .
what a disaster .
could n't get up to see the band .
i came for the bands , but i left for my car radio .
: ) let 's start with atm 's , you wan na use one ?
i had the worst experience with david in the pharmacy .
i called and unfortunately david answered the phone .
hell to the no !
it 's awful here !
_num_ .
_num_ .
went elsewhere and was passed without issue the same day .
no no no .
i do n't get all these reviews .
if i could give it no stars i would .
so you ca n't sit at those tables .
the place is rather dirty .
pizza quality seems cheap ... cheap cheese and poor topping quantity and quality .
these hot dogs , like so many before them taste exactly like hot dogs .
there will be no surprises there .
i tried the sampler and i thought the stout sucked .
overall we felt very unwelcome , and were appalled at the rude service .
maybe it was just a bad night , but i was far from impressed .
truly bad food .
the ambiance was sad .
they could do so much better .
the service was just ok .
the food was awful .
they only brew _num_ beers , and only serve those _num_ on tap .
so it tasted like burnt crust dust .
do n't get fooled .
however , this is not a place for locals .
head over to the bloomfield bridge tavern if you want some good pierogies .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the food is overpriced without a quality to back the price tag .
if you have to eat here , try one of the pizzas .
vegetarians have limited choices here .
_num_ .
the majority of people here are not like you .
skip the regular menu .
the atmosphere can not be beat , though .
_num_ stars for everything else : beer 's really not that good .
service was par - nothing special , but no complaints .
my friend 's english department had a small get together here .
it sorta is strange but get over it .
go there for the weird factor and less on the food and drinks .
the worst service i have ever gotten .
not a fan .
probably wo n't be back anytime soon .
it 's cafeteria food served on nice plates .
just another sub-par pittsburgh restaurant .
proceed with caution !
sorry , church brew , i 'm just not that impressed .
third , the beer was pretty tasty , but served lukewarm !
alas , it will be no more .
no more .
so sad .
even on a very crowded saturday night when the place was absolutely packed .
- bland and poorly done food .
the soup was tasteless .
the bison rib-eye was all gristle .
no difference !
it 's a shame that such a cool building has such crappy food .
a shame .
also , i 'm not really a fan of the beer they brew .
my wife 's appetizer came out _num_ minutes after mine and was over cooked .
our favorite entrees were definitely not the same .
the bar tender was drinking beer behind the bar which seemed very unprofessional .
although it was tasteful , why was it cold ?
the only beer here worth your time is the seasonal xmas ale .
horrible .
he was completely rude to me the whole night .
even my boyfriend brought up that he was short .
sadly , it does not .
this was ok it was our fault for being late .
the girl that took over for him _num_ minutes later was much more personable .
behind the bar was a mess .
it lacked anything special .
the atmosphere is the only redeeming quality that i can find .
ok ... i 'm being mean .
granted we only tried one item , but it was awful .
mediocre beer at inflated prices and terrible food .
food however very disappointing .
we spoke to manager and he did n't seem to care .
their beer is awful .
get a better brew master , seriously .
none of these beers taste finished .
oh -- and the restaurant stinks inside .
very patronizing , to the point where i almost said something .
even getting the check and getting out was slow .
i had the pulled pork tacos and was very disappointed .
they were so greasy and did n't have a ton of flavor .
i will say this , it is not the church brew that i remember .
my first mistake .
it was overly sweet and had no alcohol very college style .
it was dry , dry as dust and flavorless .
my husband the beer snob was excited to try the beers !
the second was a smokey sour which was just lightly smokey and no sour .
husband said all the beers were just weird and not in a good way .
we ca n't recommend this place , sad face .
the beer is nice , but nothing to get too excited about .
first off , this two star rating is due to the food and service .
but we 're in pittsburgh and by default , good beers are expected .
anywho ... rant over .
a little dry and not super unique .
the portions were huge , however .
could not wait to get there again this year .
my husband and i still looked forward to the bread pudding for dessert .
it was as dry as the desert !
the ambiance is better than the food or beer and it is quite expensive .
i did n't even eat half of it .
tonight i had the meatloaf .
the entire meal was incredibly salty , way over salty .
this restaurant ruined my new year 's eve !
my husband 's lobster bisque was good , but again , very small portion .
our server was acting like she could n't wait for us to leave .
he glazed over the whole issue and did not listen to our complaints .
so disappointing !
want to dip your fries in my chipotle ketchup ( # _num_ ) ?
i absolutely agree with every other reviewer that the service is appalling .
no surprise we waited a very very long time for the check .
do n't waste your time .
the cons : food is absolutely terrible .
please do n't bother taking anyone here for dinner .
the food was ok as long as you stick to burgers and pizza .
once we actually got sat , the wait staff was very inattentive .
we could n't even sit at the bar it was that crowded .
for decent beer and ok food , totally not worth it .
the fillings were n't great either .
my entree was the mussels , which were cooked in beer .
maybe offer a sample , instead of offering a $ _num_ beer tasting tray .
the place gets very loud and the seating is cramped .
ventilation system needs to be improved .
it smelled awful inside from the beer being brewed .
if you want slow service this is the place to go .
just nothing that exciting .
i 'm not a beer person so this is mainly food related .
came here for beer and to taste the wood fired pizza .
it was drowning in grease .
it 's not worth the wait .
i do n't know why people always say to go here .
i was just so stunned i could n't even write it up immediately .
that 's the exact same thing that was the problem last time !
that is the one thing they should have had figured out this time .
also , it 's not like we 're particularly slow eaters or anything .
this is basic food service stuff , folks .
the beer menu is confusing and not helpful .
you are a brewery , & this is not okay in my book .
the beer was not terrible , but not fantastic .
nothing i would ever order again .
the service was terrible .
the waitress seemed clueless and awkward .
the menus are awful .
very poorly designed and so confusing .
the food was mediocre .
the german potato salad was decent , and the soup was alright .
overall , i was sad when leaving .
wasted potential .
most overrated place in pittsburgh , in my opinion .
their beer is nothing special .
neither is their food .
the service was incredibly slow and inattentive .
after delivering the meals , the server never checked back .
our drinks were refilled as he handed out the checks .
unfortunately it took me another _num_ minutes to get it after ordering .
the jambalaya was not very impressive .
actually , it was boring .
( and maybe the heating bill for a church in late november ) .
neat concept but lacking in execution .
wait staff seemed disinterested .
the salad , in the end , was $ _num_ !
that 's a bit ridiculous for this style of restaurant .
however , it was n't enough to keep us coming back .
i give this place _num_ stars for the really cool building and the beer .
the food , horrible !
the food was really bad .
two of us ordered the wood fire oven pizza , both were horrible .
no taste at all .
alas , no .
but the place smells terrible , it 's really ( really ) loud .
and there is no air conditioning .
the appetizer we ordered was the lettuce wraps and it was fine .
while the food was fine , it just was n't great .
i was expecting something really different or super tasty and this was not it .
beer is a _num_ , food is a 1-2 star .
unless you get the pizza , of which they were out when we went .
to start , the service was awful .
`` oh , i thought someone already helped you '' , they responded .
we ordered appetizers , bruschetta and a lentil mushroom ball .
i 'm disappointed by the service , and incredibly disappointed by the food .
would give _num_ stars for the location , ambience .
... kids had pizza , it was bit burnt too salty ... disappointed .
a+ for decor and ambience .
the beer and food falls a bit flat .
no brewery in pittsburgh can compete with this one in this category .
i 'm a big belgian beer fan but both really needed some love .
really missed the mark .
no issues on this part but nothing over the top either .
the beer is average - definitely nothing to rave about .
the staff is n't the friendliest .
the food is okay , but overpriced for what it is .
it took another _num_ minutes for her to come back for them .
granted , i 'm from nyc .
now , for the food : it was crap .
so i asked the waitress about the quinoa salad at church brew .
the quinoa was unbelievable .
it tasted like old refrigerator .
oh god , this place .
i love mussels , and these were some of the worst .
they were so cold , i could n't even touch them .
the ambiance is even worse !
service was friendly , but inattentive .
but yeah , i wo n't be returning to church brew works .
$ _num_ bucks for lunch for _num_ .
could n't recognize the broccoli in the dish as sauce was ridiculously thick .
gross .
but avoid food , too pricey & not tasty .
lots of better options in the city .
the food and service are terrible .
food : tastes terrible , portion size is small and price is very high .
they have no wheat base beer .
the server was not interested much in waiting .
the service was poor and the food was not good .
i would not recommend spending the money to eat here .
in addition the acoustics are a disaster .
the food and beer are both mediocre at best .
this place is over rated and just not good .
food here is expensive and they use sub-par ingredients .
i 've tried a variety of dishes here , and all fall flat .
would not recommend .
yet could see _num_ other empty tables .
guess they do n't want my business .
over the years it slowly lost it 's luster .
they were very obviously looking to do as little work as possible .
three under cabinet light boxes installed and the switch on an exhaust fan replaced .
this company does not stand by it 's work .
the famous fish sandwiches are large , but not worth ordering more than once .
i did n't drink here , nor did i attend any musical events .
this place was horrible .
all fried food and we waited about _num_ min to get our meals .
i wo n't be going back there ever .
their fish sandwich is only famous for being awful !
piece of fried fish on a plain bun , that 's it !
no sauce , no condiments .
lame .
i have never been so ignored .
find your kitchen and bath stuff somewhere else .
went to the store february 5th and was ignored .
had my car repaired here due to someone hitting my front driver side .
the other two did a mediocre job vacuuming and barely dried the car .
pathetic .
underwhelmed is how i would sum up my experience .
_num_ stars and i wo n't be back .
i paid $ _num_ for the everything wash and towel dry .
this was hands down the worst car service i have ever received .
i went straight to washington blvd carwash and completed the interior myself .
if i could give a half star rating , i would .
this place is an absolute ripoff .
i had a bad feeling from the start and my gut was correct .
avoid this place !
i purchased a gift card for a detailed auto wash .
this is probably the worse car wash i have ever been too .
not once did they complete the work as stated .
also their pricing is high for the poor work they deliver .
the worst car wash i have ever been to .
so i needed to get my toes done last minute .
originally i was going to wear tennis shoes but then decided on open toe .
i noticed when i walked in that the lady didnt open new utensils .
so , i didnt really think much of it at the time .
it ate away at my big toe !
did n't even get a massage .
no thanks .
terrible pedicure !
i wish i had looked at the reviews before going there for pedicure .
u go in with dry heels and leave the same way .
i could have done my own pedi for that matter .
do n't waste your money .
the chemical smell in there is so strong my mother had to leave .
it was really bad .
my gel polish lasted one day one before it chipped .
the staff is not friendly there are long waits for poor service .
this company all around is the worse i 've ever dealt with .
i did n't realize until we ordered that it was a smoking bar .
Positive
the biggest negative for me was how long it took to get our food .
i was there on my lunch break and it was not at all crowded .
personally , i wo n't be back .
the food is decent but the wait for the food can be terribly slow .
i really am not a fan .
i struggled to read the last two lines of letters on the chart .
terrible customer service and record keeping .
also ... a bad selection of glasses .
really can not recommend .
the onion soup is not a french onion soup .
kudos to piper 's pub for doing something different .
the flavor was there , but why was it so watered down ?
i opted for dry toast instead , picked off of kristen 's plate .
service was slow .
there 's no real atmosphere there .
my most recent visit here was n't one to rave about .
it was extremely loud inside .
i had my family with me and they ordered fried zucchini for an appetizer .
and my younger niece she ordered chicken fingers with fries .
i 'm sorry to say that i probably wo n't be going back here .
what awful customer service !
the absolute worst .
letting people take up tables for _num_ hours is an absolute joke .
we are regular patrons but today was pathetic .
this information was not in the description on yelp or their website .
the main problem was our waiter .
it was shockingly bad .
this is in no way possible british cuisine .
do n't waste your money on this dump .
i dont know why this pub is so highly rated in yelp .
this is the most dull irish pub i have ever been to .
terrible service !
it seems like they do n't want customers .
i went to watch a soccer game and i regret it .
they were rude , and the waiters seemed annoyed by everything .
scotch eggs - overcooked and burnt .
the bagels were rubbery , but not as much as the egg .
i must say , i was n't hungry after i was done .
_num_ out of _num_ times you come to this location the order is wrong .
not even close , and i was the only one in line .
only go if desperate for food and or hungover .
no , thanks .
completely ruins the bagel .
work , i would never stop at this one .
that should not be necessary .
which it typically is not .
eventually i just stopped going .
and i hate that they make you check all bags .
it really is n't .
do not even try to order from them online !
garbage !
what horrible customer service !
disgusting .
i added three packs of soy sauce to make it taste like something .
still probably better than any quick options at the dirty bird next door .
this place has shockingly expensive drinks for an establishment that looks divey .
that 's why no one ever goes here .
i 'm not sure how they stay in business , but god bless them .
whatever the case , awful experience , will never go back .
sometimes i get okay service but usually i feel like i 'm mostly ignored .
and it 's really not .
i 'm not sure why i keep letting this place disappoint me .
do n't expect dive bar prices , or that friendly dive bar service .
this place is horrible !
which this dump most definitely is not .
as well , it 's nearly impossible to get a drink from the bartenders .
but it fails to work here .
then they hit total strangers up for a drink .
fail !
this place is terrible .
it 's a dive bar that stinks and it seems like a funeral home .
the draft beer made me sick .
it tasted like they had n't cleaned the lines in years .
my friends like to drink and they all walked out without finishing their drinks .
he literally had to reach in his pocket for a napkin .
not the amazingly friendly service the sign describes .
extremely rude staff .
perhaps just a miserable person .
took a couple bites and really could not bring myself to finish it .
and the wait to get drinks can be pretty freaking long too .
it gets one star only because they do have alcohol .
the music was too random to be ironic .
that was a poor decision .
the food was fried to a crisp , tasted awful , and was overpriced .
this place is awful .
it screams trash .
the place is dirty , the service is awful .
i would not recommend this to anyone .
there are better places to go now .
ok i get it you are busy .
but you are going to make a grand tonight so suck it up cupcake .
my biggest complaint however was the clientele .
you may ask why this review is getting a _num_ star .
lots of wood and stained glass .
all in all this place is a passable bar prior to about _num_ pm .
this place sucks if you 're an adult .
please ask me to send my bad experience video !
waitresses are really rude here absolutely never going back !
and she was so rude when i tried to talk to her !
not a fan .
bad service .
place was busy for a sunday night filled with young college students .
cleanliness was ok and the staff was friendly .
prices were a little on the high end especially with the poor drink quality .
do not plan to return and do n't recommend .
jim was extremely unappealing in every possible way , not just physically .
he was just a fucking dick who forced us to stand in the rain .
the whole place smells like old man cigar smoke , fish , and feet .
they do n't even dance at this place .
it 's just a typical , lame racist college bar .
nothing special .
first off the service at this place is horrible .
the sushi was about the same quality that i get at giant eagle .
here ends the rant prescribed by this reviewer for this restaurant .
i 've tried to like nakama , i really have .
this is where it all ends and goes south though .
at peak dinner hours , you literally have to fight your way through everything .
nakama is not the place .
ick -- avoid this place .
i took one bite of the sushi and stopped eating it .
still nothing in front of me .
i 'm not sure what people see in this place .
just not what i consider a `` happening scene '' .
also , my bartender made me taste the sake before giving it to me .
ca n't verify that though .
has anyone else noted the playing cards stuck to the ceiling ?
and the fish ... oh the fish , no flavor .
but i would not go back there for any food any time soon .
it was pretty packed and indeed , it was very loud and very dark .
their sushi is lousy , and their hibachi is mediocre at best !
has such bad ratings on yelp .
nakama totally did not live up to the hype for me .
i had the hibachi and it was just mediocre .
until then , i 'm not quickly planning my next nakama outing .
it was really bad .
but for the love of god , do n't come here for any reason .
however , not the greatest hibachi , nor the most authentic either .
it 's also really loud in the restaurant .
it took _num_ minutes to receive our drinks .
the manager apologized and went to grab a chef for us .
however when the meal was finally cooked and served it was 11:30 .
the appetizer was ahi tuna , which requires no cooking .
i would never eat here again unless they were taken over by new ownership .
and then they would get one chance .
nothing special , but a little better than little tokyo .
bartender was rude .
soup was way too salty .
service was horrible .
had to pass all used dishes to the waitress across the grill .
will not hurry back .
once was enough , i 'll never go back there again .
the food was pretty terrible through and through .
the sushi was your average run of the mill raw fish .
you wo n't regret it .
no t-shirts , yet the food was terrible !
ick !
even if it 's bad , it wo n't be as expensive as nakama .
but , there are better places to be had in pittsburgh .
the waitstaff is decent , but the hibachi chefs are kind of weak .
i guess there 's not a lot of small talk to be had .
our drinks were always full and the service was spectacular .
all of the food tasted like a shadow of what it could have been .
the place as also very loud .
you could n't hear anyone else talk unless they were right next to you .
i do n't give many two star reviews , but this place deserves it .
i ca n't comment on the sushi as we did n't order any .
because people are clueless .
i have tried nakama 's _num_ times to be fair .
do n't waste your time , money or taste buds ... .
ridiculous .
it was crowded and loud , why the dance music at sushi place ?
the japanese soup which is usually chicken based was mushroom based , yuck .
the rice was decent , the sauce on the meals was just average .
over rated , over priced and always crowded .
simply disappointed in the lack of basic customer service .
sushi is inconsistent .
i 've had bad sushi here several times .
no booze .
do i think this place is a bit over rated ?
shrimp tempura was beer batter , not tempura .
seaweed salad was hard - how does that even happen ?
sushi was mushy with overcooked rice and too much of it .
it 's just a buttery fried rice fest in your mouth .
not a fan of this place at all .
and the service was horrible .
what is so hard about bringing me a lemon with my water ?
i thought this place was awful .
the most recent time was the worst i have ever seen .
i 've experienced better .
we could n't even eat together .
little tokyo in mt .
ca n't say that about a lot of sushi restaurants .
i do n't know about them but my experience was not that impressive .
i 'm probably going to go ahead and split this up into sections .
unfortunately this table only fit _num_ guests at a time while one guests stood .
the sushi at this place sucks and is extremely overpriced .
the sushi is poorly rolled and falls apart .
the fish and ingredients that they use are not fresh .
the chefs are similar to what you will get any hibachi place .
do n't go here if you are gluten free .
our server was pretty clueless and they could n't prepare gf sushi .
my friend got the complete wrong sushi order .
i do n't get the attraction to this place .
fried rice seemed bulk and not freshly made .
very busy at lunch .
almost like they were n't ready for a friday lunch .
slow service , mediocre food .
however , the food has yet to come .
trendy ambiance , fresh sushi , but the worst hibachi i 've ever had .
the miso soup tasted like the packet cup of soup you buy in college .
the hibachi chef did n't even ask how she wanted it to be cooked .
our servers attentiveness was minimal and we did n't require a lot .
our meals were okay but nothing special .
she was very rude about it in the end and never apologized or anything .
we will spend our money elsewhere when we go to the next show .
the waitress had a terrible attitude and a face to match .
never coming back : ( i 've given this place so many chances .
the boston roll was okay , but not very cool .
even the sashimi was above room temp and very fishy and just bad .
but we have much better choices for japanese food in pittsburgh .
it is extremely loud which i expected , but didnt help the experience .
overall , it was a decent meal but i dont think we would return .
had the hibachi sesame chicken , my husband had the hibachi steak .
i 'm talking sick like from the movie bridesmaids .
it was bad .
spend your money elsewhere .
service was terrible and will not be returning .
ugh this place is so overrated !
the service is awful and everything is so overpriced !
no ice cream and no recognition of my son 's birthday .
customer and frequent lover of nakama for over _num_ yrs now .
bad customer service bad business ethics mr. chris .
this is not a place to have an enjoyable dinner .
this place is noisy and dark .
his skill sucks and could n't even do the onion volcano correctly .
never going back to this place .
this was truly a major disappointment .
the restaurant is way over-priced and the food is just `` average '' .
shrimp was ok but the steak was tough and over cooked .
service was marginal yet the restaurant was not full .
very disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone .
also there were no acknowledgement of anyone 's birthday despite telling the waitress .
the service was pretty disappointing overall .
another thing that i found disappointing was the small portion size for hibachi .
not even a small scoop of ice cream at the end .
so needless to say i was kinda bummed out about this too .
i think my bartender was having a bad day .
this was my least favorite experience at nakama .
i just can not get over the service .
i will get my hibachi / sushi fix elsewhere .
.
probably the worst hibachi i have ever experienced .
the food was overpriced mediocre hibachi .
the rice was n't cooked well enough , and the hibachi chicken was tough .
i was pretty disappointed with my experience here the other night .
overall , i was not very satisfied with the service .
i will probably only go there now for the sushi as a takeout item .
my son ordered shrimp hibachi i ordered chicken fried rice .
service at the bar in the daytime is very lacking .
throw it away and put a xmas beer there .
she was rude and ignorant !
just plain mean .
was really ignorant about it too .
zero management i guess .
the drinks are watered down and over priced .
the sushi is lack luster .
no wonder the place was 1/2 empty .
honestly nothing special compared to other hibachi places .
i probably wo n't be back - just not worth how average it is .
my last time here was yesterday , the worst experience ever .
after this time , never to come back again .
Neutral
if i could give this place negative stars , i absolutely would .
had a reservation for _num_ last friday .
susan called sun over and complained about my friend .
at no point did sun attempt to hear my friend 's point of view .
needless to say , we took our business elsewhere .
this was my first and last nakama experience .
i will never step foot in that place again .
i 'll eat gas station sushi before i give them my money .
or at the very least , make sure sun and susan are n't working .
sharing food is a strict no .
walked out of there as soon as possible .
sushi is tasty but no options that really stand out .
service was not so good .
valet returned car keys because they were going to leave early .
this place is not worth your time or money !
i could n't even finish , or get all of the side dishes .
or lack there of .
she is mortified and confused .
but that 's not even the point .
call corporate if you feel it was inappropriate . ''
i will never set foot in this racist establishment again !
this place is the worst .
the food is n't good and it 's super pretentious .
visited michael 's pizza bar mid june _num_ with a friend .
we sat at the bar and were quickly helped .
at least fifteen minutes went by before she came over to me .
after some people cleared out , i was able to get a little service .
unfortunately , the service ruined my experience .
the worst place i have ever been .
i dread coming to this starbucks .
have you ever walked into a place and felt totally uncomfortable ?
unless you walk here , forget finding a parking space .
carson street is very busy , and it 's hard to park .
and no foam means no foam .
i do not give _num_ star reviews easily .
unacceptable !
below my eyebrows ?
only to receive my car back - clutch not right .
he estimated $ _num_ , can have it back to me in a day .
worst bar ever !
they lost all of our business .
cheesy island decor .
do n't show up here sober .
anyway , tiki lounge really does cater directly to that craving .
the woman just opens a corona ( regular ) and does n't say anything .
and then this bartender is like well we do n't have corona light .
ok weird , but we can get over it .
she was so horrible as a bartender and just ignorant as a person !
drinks were cheap .
the other bartenders were friendly which goes a long way .
going there on a saturday was awful !
i was there for _num_ mins tops .
so there is no way you are going to get a drink .
it was a gross experience .
try the lava place instead , much more interesting .
it was way way way too crowded .
the service was awful and the bartenders were so rude .
the girl who made my `` zombie '' handed me this pale red drink .
i guess they just make whatever the crap they feel like .
just play it safe and get a beer or something .
in fact ordering it was a pretty big pain in the ass .
there were fish tanks and water falls , tiki cocktail glasses and rainforest decor .
second , the hallway with the bathrooms smelled awful .
lastly , the dance floor was way too small .
with all that room in that building , they should really expand that area .
went to the bar around _num_ and was n't opened .
made the mistake of visiting on a saturday night .
dear lord , it was crowded .
the bouncers were rude and harsh ... the whole experience was just unpleasant .
i really like tiki bars and was excited to go here .
we sat down at a table and received no service .
i had to get up _num_ minutes later and goto the bar to order .
that 's when he escorted us out and was extremely rude .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
when we walked in the place looked cool but worn and kinda old .
as far as just a cool bar to chill , it was n't fun .
he was , instead , promptly encouraged to buy a new bicycle .
but to not even acknowledge a customer as they enter the store is inexcusable .
thick was not very busy .
no luck .
do i know anything about providing superior customer experiences ?
guess where i 'm headed next ?
my experience here was weird as shit .
we sat down , ordered coffee and drinks , and then waited .
i 'm not kidding .
how the hell is this place still in business ?
i had a veggie hoagie and cheese fries .
they also made the mistake of putting canned mushrooms in the mix .
it is dirt cheap and if they had veggie alternatives i would definitely return .
no big deal .
will never return here .
an extreme amount of cigarette smoke in the air .
disgusting .
not sure about now .
the crowd was mainly regulars , the drinks were cheap .
this was my home away from home for a while .
or for , you know , breathing wrong .
the guy clearly has no sense of humor .
no food except for a vending machine .
that does n't seem like a tall order for a pizza joint that delivers .
but the phone call i just experienced would suggest otherwise .
even new york pizza is n't considered true italian .
sausage between the layers of dough ?
sounds disgusting when you think about it .
basically a chicago style pizza is a quiche , minus the eggs of course .
the service was so bad i almost walked out .
i will not go back if the two miserable girls are working .
the customer service is the worst i have ever experienced .
i was told it would take _num_ minutes but it really took _num_ minutes .
the food was very bad .
i have no other way to put it .
the pasta was completely tasteless .
i would 've been better off ordering pasta from pizza hut .
next time you 're in the area , just skip this place .
the dough is not right the ingredients are not seasoned enough .
i ordered a small chicago style pizza .
mediocre at best .
the were fried extra to the point where each bite tasted of burnt coating .
the pizza came and the crust was anything but , more like bread .
they would n't do a full refund as we ate some of the pizza .
the manager never even came out to talk to me .
terrible customer service .
beyond ridiculous .
happened on a fri around _num_ am .
worst customer service i 've ever experienced in my life .
it was unbelievable .
got the ultra huge _num_ slice cheese pizza .
i do n't even wan na give them one star .
disappointed .
everything ( white pizza and breadsticks ) was very , very bland .
the spinach topping is just bagged frozen spinach for a whole $ _num_ extra .
just wanted to warn yelpers about this place .
i do n't think i 'd be comfortable staying at the inn , though .
he seemed cranky , rude and almost annoyed at having people in his inn .
stopped in for dinner around _num_ on a wednesday and it was very dead .
for my choice of side i went with fries .
never received any communication regarding upcoming events , classes , discounts etc .
not recommend to become a member .
the food ... was ... boring .
i would never , ever go there again .
even the desert was lacking .
the wine was bland .
the entree was overcooked and underwhelming .
meaning i have only gone there once and would never return .
this is going to be short .
awful place .
disgusting .
the food was rather quick to come to the table and looked very good .
as i normally do , i tried the meat and the sauce separately .
trying to find that balance , i began adding the sauce to the gyro .
with each bite , i had to add more sauce .
i did n't need to eat anymore of it .
they were also piping hot and made to order .
not the same since it was sold years back .
their gyros are over priced , and are the size of samples .
i waited on forever and i only ordered one gyro .
only because there the ones that take more time .
worst gyro on the south side .
the amount of salt on these things was ridiculous .
i like salt on pretzels , but this one had too much .
think of those microwave pretzels you get from sam 's or costco .
am i missing something ?
occasionally , co-workers pick-up the `` cheese '' sauce .
i love all types of cheese , but this looks and tastes terrible .
the pretzels were all cold - even the ones we asked them to heat .
nothing special .
we had to ask for dipping sauce as it was not offered to us .
pathetic !
drove _num_ minutes to get there and no pretzels , not cool .
relatively bad .
can i give this place no stars ?
not that i tan much , anyway .
just having him look at you is enough to make you uncomfortable .
it 's not a very professional atmosphere .
i only kept going there because i had a package .
not the cleanest .
prices are very inexpensive .
this place has taken a turn downhill , possibly ?
shame jack 's , for shame !
it 's so bad you have to love it .
they would n't serve me .
so he like crappy tunes .
our bad .
if they are different , i 'll happily try this place again .
this was my first turn off .
five seconds later the wings were there .
i 'm not exaggerating .
there is quick , and then there is way too quick .
it gets worse .
this was our 1st stop .
this is a pet peeve of mine .
overall , the place was a typical dive bar , nothing special about it .
we had allowed ample time to get to the theater .
without the jumper , we would have arrived _num_ min early .
the ventilation system , if there is one , is pretty bad .
it 's gets very , very stuffy in there .
i 've had better , i 've had worse .
gets a little crowded in there sometimes but lately , what place does n't .
we had a miserable experience tonight at club cafe .
however , the menu was so sticky and disgusting that we just left .
sorry , lava lounge ... i wish we could have hit it off .
friday night _num_ 's dance party .
_num_ pbr drafts until 11pm so we only had a couple special drinks .
completely different from what i 've read or expected .
vibe was a little off , and the bar area was too crowded .
the back where the lounge is was empty and creepy .
the only reason i gave this place two stars is because of the smoking .
i doubt that i will go back solely because of the cigarette smoke .
place looked awesome .
idk what was wrong today but all the pumps were out of order .
ugh , this place is gross .
prices high , food great , but i ca n't afford this .
but , i ruined the salad by getting calamari on it .
gross !
it was a little uncomfortable sitting by myself at the bar .
no sports on tv and no one to chat with at the bar .
the mary was so bland and boring .
i doubt i 'll be back here .
ok place for a lunchtime burger or breakfast .
sadly it was nothing of the sort .
who were very friendly hence the _num_ star rating .
but it was so quite and uncomfortable .
nothing in breakfast should ever be microwaved .
needless to say we barley ate anything and will never go back .
unfortunate because they seemed really nice .
i just wish the food had been as good .
$ _num_ maybe .
the salad greens were a bit limp and several of my pieces were brown .
the bread was bland `` white bread '' shaped like a baguette .
my wife ordered chicken and prosciutto with pasta .
this just seemed way too much for what the food we received .
disappointed .
the bread was a baguette that tasted like it came in a can .
my companion 's sausage and pepper ravioli was , he said , awful .
the check was extremely slow in coming .
and then they waited another 20-30 minutes to get the card back .
the worst part ?
if this meal had cost $ _num_ , it would have been passable .
it was nearly twice that much .
horrible treatment .
this past visit it was dead empty with the exception of staff .
what was outrageous was that the horrible way the owner treated us .
small wonder the place was empty .
overpriced food , lousy wine selection and not even a friendly neighborhood atmosphere .
i took the advice of a friend and stuck with safe menu choices .
mediocre wine overpriced .
wish dish were open for lunch .
at that point i just wanted to get out of there .
i do n't see myself going back .
sadly , i just had a poor experience there .
got the roast beef bland nothing special .
the f work ever two min that my wife did not care to hear .
the menu is very boring typical bar food .
wish i could have given it zero stars but that 's not an option !
`` , as loud as he possibly could .
the breakfast menu was way smaller than anticipated .
there was definitely some crusty stuff on the rim of my coffee mug .
i got the chicken parm over pasta .
the chicken crust was crispy , sauce was good but nothing special .
i will never set foot in hear again .
_num_ stars from some ?
the second time the service was slow , but nothing to write home about .
so at this point we 'd been there for _num_ minutes .
when we got our coffees we realized we had no spoons and no sugar .
she seemed annoyed that i was asking , and i asked very politely .
i would not suggest taking vehicles to extra mile auto .
first of all , i hate waiting in lines .
my god , the cakes were delicious .
i could have had nothing but cake for brunch that day .
sit down with others at one table .
i believe that their menu is _num_ % vegetarian .
not a fan .
crusty .
sloppy .
quick give me a real egg and meat !
is the food vegan ?
disgusting .
that being said , the atmosphere is awesome as is the store .
for that , they get _num_ stars from me .
the dessert , like cakes , was just too sweet and heavy ... .
the atmosphere is awesome , i will give them that .
however the rest of my experience was kind of frustrating .
do n't do it out in the open , not very smart or nice .
the food was mediocre .
the pancakes that my sister ordered tasted like pure baking powder .
they did n't have to-go boxes !
over all this place had a chaotic vibe to it .
i really wanted to like this place , i really did .
but it just was not a good experience unfortunately .
would not recommend to a friend .
no problem , i understand that this happens .
they charge hefty fees without telling you anything .
holy hell , do n't eat at this bk .
multiple people i know have gotten very sick from eating at this bk .
if you 're craving burger king , go else where .
the crew is slow , surly , and rude .
the staff is typically rude .
i would n't step foot in this place .
as far as burger king goes , take the time to go elsewhere .
the food is typical burger king fare but definately get a to go bag .
i then requested barbeque .
i also noticed that the cheese slices on the floor were still there .
the work area looks very dirty .
it was heavily stained with grease and pop .
`` chicken nuggets and french fries , '' i thought to myself .
`` chicken nuggets and french fries , '' i repeated out loud .
another customer ahead of me inquired about the french fries .
my mother used to get ones just like it at costco .
the chicken nuggets came out .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
the hamburger was correct , i 'll give them that .
the fries were cold .
says they closed at _num_ that night .
i did n't actually eat anything here because i just picked up jimmy johns .
looked like it would hurt on the way out .
_num_ stars .
dirty ... even for a thrift store .
why are thrift stores becoming so expensive !
i like the ring enough . ''
_num_ hours later i realized the ring felt uncomfortable on my finger .
i explained to her that i threw it away by accident .
thought i paid at least $ _num_ for it , but brushed it off .
_num_ .
unfortunately is was lame , lame , lame .
the bar was dark , dirty , and the decorations were not my thing .
bread was 2-3 days old , & stale .
the oil was ... vegetable oil with salt & pepper .
no other choices ... and our waitress did n't even think they had ranch .
got a side of balsamic vinegar instead .
sucks .
the service here on a saturday morning was ridiculously slow .
oddly enough , _num_ minutes was just right to decide what we wanted .
it 's diner food not gourmet a la carte .
i went in with very low expectations .
large gyro with no lettuce and sauce on the side .
the service so far had been very slow .
the arrival of the soup did nothing to reverse my thought on this issue .
the gyro and the hot roast beef sandwich arrived .
trying the gyro sauce , i can honestly say that it was n't traditional .
i really do n't care for ranch .
throughout the entire ordeal of tasting the food , my cup went dry .
and it stayed dry -- for a long time .
overall it was a lackluster experience that i really do n't want to repeat .
i might return if someone really wants to go .
i realize that this is one of those southside staples .
a girl 's stomach can only handle so much bland wet mush though .
eggs , toast , meats , and potatoes .
each and every time , the eggs are still sloppy and not completely cooked .
the bacon is so far from crispy it should n't be consumed .
yeah , the kids ai n't lying , this place blows .
we went today and the service was awful .
then _num_ minutes before she came back to get our order .
then _num_ minutes later she came back to confirm she had our order right .
then _num_ minutes before we got our sandwiches .
oh yah , and the food ... mediocre for a college cafeteria .
only good for people watching .
waste of time , complete waste of money , will not return .
back then , i would have given it three or maybe even four stars .
no more tom 's for me .
i stayed here recently for a work trip .
reservations and payment : i booked a group of _num_ rooms for four days .
i never received a reply to this email .
needless to say , i 've not hear back from them .
it 's a shame since the actual property is pretty nice .
i stayed here recently for a work trip .
reservations and payment : i booked a group of _num_ rooms for four days .
i never received a reply to this email .
needless to say , i 've not hear back from them .
it 's a shame since the actual property is pretty nice .
the room reeked like a dive bar on a sunday morning .
parking is not included in ur room .
also parking is _num_ per room .
i dont think id stay here again bc of the parking .
but , not so quiet .
hence , _num_ , not _num_ , star .
if you have a family staying in pittsburgh , go elsewhere .
dirty and wet towels in the tub with used shampoo dripping down .
that 's not all folks !
dirty and rude staff .
do not waste your hard earned money .
i was never followed up with , and we finally left for dinner .
yeah , i heard about that , i ca n't believe it ! ''
wifi was slow and spotty .
also , avoid dealing with rosa , very rude .
ugh .
do you want to sleep ?
i would not recommend booking a room here .
too bad .
only eat the breakfast if you 're desperate .
that 's the only good thing i can say about my experience here .
empty parking lot .
empty lobby .
yet none of the rooms are available .
disgusting .
shuttle that rarely is running on time .
so sad to see the change in just a few months with new management .
it used to be our go to hotel for pittsburgh trips but no more .
horrible experience in the horrible stay for four days !
my hands were full so they said they would send someone up .
no room cleaning , nothing .
no apology .
because right now i 'm at _num_ minutes and counting .
also , there was no manager available .
worst hotel experience ever .
there also were no sheets on top of the mattress covers .
it was disgusting .
do not recommend this hotel to anyone .
breakfast offered very little variety and most of the food was cold .
gross .
but no , my medications are not ready .
finally , i go back , and am ready to pay for my medicine .
there should be three , not just two .
there was no apology .
there was no attempt to fill the missed prescription faster .
this place is small , but that is n't the issue .
southside deserves a better grocery store .
i miss this place .
disgusting .
zero stars .
owner is extremely rude .
employee did n't wash hands as he left the bathroom .
and the food was terrible .
also the crowd they attract is n't a good one .
i try to avoid this place .
also a waitress tried to argue that creamy italian was ranch .
no , it 's not .
anyway , i did not have the chance to pick this up monday afternoon .
this ca n't be serious .
needless to say this did not sit well .
mostly light meal oriented w/ panini and sandwiches .
i wish i had n't come here to work .
does n't open early enough ... coffee shop for those without real jobs .
cold service .
wifi is n't free , so get that out of your mind .
there are other coffee shops in the south side that offer a better experience .
i have nothing good to say about this place .
avoid .
things have changed for the worse .
i have been a frequent customer for nearly _num_ years .
but , i think tonight is the last night i will be going .
things literally changed overnight from good to bad .
not turned down , off .
at least five other tables cleared out almost immediately .
but , next time i 'm in the southside i 'm going to starbucks .
are you kidding me ?
you 're going to get people sick !
you charge almost $ _num_ for a cup of coffee .
but then i watched the pull end in a watery stream .
this pull was nearly straight water .
this is where i promptly sat down to write this review .
the failure here is in fact not the barista .
i ca n't see it being a really effective study place now .
the remaining room is very long and narrow , and feels crowded .
avoid !
this place sucks .
overpriced drinks and rude staff .
so rude !
unfriendly , often talking to each other instead of helping the next customer .
the coffee was amazing , but the service was terrible .
sadly they are the only one located in south side .
if not , then stay away from this place .
this store has too much packed in to a too tiny space .
that was maybe six inches tall and a foot across .
overall , i can say i 'm not coming back .
what a shame ... .
shit , no , i need to quit being such a b .
do n't even get me started .
no .
just , no .
disappointed , i ventured back upstairs and started looking through the used cds .
i 'm sorry , but $ _num_ for a used cd ?
are you kidding me ?
anywhere , really , as the choice here is n't that mind blowing .
i can assume they were on par with other used movie places .
i just was n't wowed .
for vinyl , dave 's is a major disappointment .
and that 's even more depressing .
the food was n't bad but a little overpriced .
hey , everyone was doing it .
i was _num_ , not _num_ , mind you .
and not just tiny bit off , but it literally hung to one side .
over the next couple months i kept telling myself that it was n't crooked .
just do n't go to hot rod .
the place itself , is n't anything fancy or nice .
do n't expect any atmosphere , which is no big deal .
i 'd rather go after work or on my day off .
terrible terrible customer service .
when i got there i could n't even find a table .
but , i figured he had a bad day .
i sat there another _num_ minutes waiting .
anyway , thankfully , the rude cook did not bring out the salad .
it was really bad .
if anyone was reviewing this incident , i think they would be horrified .
you would think that 's common sense , but apparently not ?
horrible service takes a long time .
the waitresses are uninterested at best and downright rude at worst .
they always seem like it is an inconvenience that you are there .
i heard great things about the fish sandwich .
good food , but service is horrible .
waited _num_ minutes for a waitress .
this has to be the absolute worst kfc i have ever been to .
their staff are rude and trashy .
the place managed to give me a nasty case of food poisoning !
most of the equipment is very old and out of date .
the atmosphere is not cheery .
the only reason i go here is because my prescription plan is with them .
normally they are priced higher than your average grocery store .
but last last week was the last time i 'll go there .
but we could only finish _num_ of the _num_ .
that 's ridiculous !
i can understand if i was taking home _num_ or more , but _num_ ?
i have never been treated so poorly by an establishment .
i have only complained at _num_ other establishment in my life .
but today is the second time when i have bad experience .
like _num_ people inside .
and only for us he gave beers in plastic cups .
he finally gave us beer in glasses and turned around pissed off .
it 's a hit or miss here .
the mac and cheese bites were good .
the wings were also cold .
big disappointment on the wings .
update ; the bartender confirmed the wings are from restaurant depot .
i have been to the ugly dog multiple times .
i 'm in food and beverage and something needs to be resolved .
dumpy and old .
worst hampton inn i 've stayed at .
the raised the rate on me just before i arrived .
general manager has no idea what customer service is .
Neutral
would of given negative stars but was not able to .
i stay at this hampton inn green tree every month ( on average ) .
the rooms are very dated and very dark .
_num_ . )
i hate this set-up .
_num_ ) they refuse to offer a _num_ p.m. check-out for diamond members .
this place is horrible !
_num_ bites in and i tossed the whole meal .
a waste of $ _num_ and i am still hungry .
it is a `` hole in the wall '' .
when i tried it once last year , i was pleased .
however , i ordered _num_ days ago & while delivery was super fast ?
broccoli was too mushy .
suffering !
the only other decent items were the chicken soup and wonton soup .
not good .
too expensive for portion size .
generic brown sauce thrown in with different veggies to make different dishes .
wont be wasting any more money here .
the cashew chicken should be so much better .
i dunno .
man , that 's not much of a compliment , is it ?
the food came much faster than i expected , which was great .
i ordered the house fried rice and the beef stick app .
the fried rice was just ok .
but the beef sticks were so gross .
i have no idea how anyone could make food that bad .
i think it 's nearly impossible to make beef taste as bad as this .
of nasty so called pork .
wtf is that i ask ?
do n't waste your money !
hands down the worst chinese food i 've ever had .
bland and flavorless food .
i ordered the wonton soup and moo goo gai pan .
pretty disappointing and overpriced .
do n't waste your money here .
i 've ordered from here twice now and been disappointed both times .
food is all the same deep fried chicken with different sauces .
i would n't recommend this place .
i had it replaced by goodyear before we drove back to pa .
they refused to fix it .
they replaced the entire thing under warranty .
do n't trust ryan 's auto .
wow what a mess this was .
of course they also have the new policy of no samples for beer .
another reason o go elsewhere for your $ _num_ beer .
by the way , no one called us liars there either !
it is substandard even by basic bar food standards and it is extremely overpriced .
fool me once , shame on you .
fool me twice , shame on me !
my first mistake was to order anything from the kitchen .
go for the beer but dine elsewhere .
the food was not that great .
if i went again , i would stick with just the fried food .
are you kidding me ?
no , let 's talk about the service .
believe me , i 've not just been there a couple of times .
this particular location might be the worst of the bunch .
bottom line : overpriced , bad service , shitty beer .
the beers are way too expensive compared to other pubs .
the service is awful & the building is a dirty old house .
they just do n't know what they are doing .
cole slaw was bland .
more than likely wo n't be making a second trip back .
needless to say about an hour later they both got very sick beyond words .
overall horrible outcome except for the great server .
delivery driver delivered pizza and we tipped in cash .
we used to frequent this place , but will never go back .
they are rude and we do not recommend their food .
neither will our friends or family .
if i could give zero stars i would .
this company made it _num_ times more stressful than i anticipated .
once they have it - just nasty and totally unhelpful .
but otherwise , this was n't a great idea .
really bad experience .
we showed up at _num_ on saturday and the place looked dead .
super annoying and frustrating experience .
oh my ... dont like the food here .
rude !
instead , sadly , i met with great disappointment .
it took nearly a half hour to get my takeout .
now , upon entering my car i found only disappointment .
it was listed as open on yelp !
he finds something wrong with one of them and tells the cooks .
it has n't changed since you asked twice five minutes ago .
this place is horrible .
what 's worse is that lady does not care .
pretty nasty customer service .
i am so unimpressed by this florist .
i 'll do my bargain hunting elsewhere , thanks .
doesnt anyone know what pete 's wicked ale is ?
btw , thanks for wasting our time ... .
we get here and it 's confusing from the start .
she walks off .
someone else comes over and puts down two pepsi glasses .
looks like there is no communication here - or light fixtures .
we 've done it before and it 's worked .
well , excuse me , mr. sassy pants .
i get the chicken sandwich , he gets the roast beef au jus .
my sandwich was the most uninspired thing i 've seen in a long time .
needless to say , the food was terrible .
had the spaghetti and meatballs , i was quite disappointed .
i was n't impressed with the food at all .
the service was worse .
a little while later our soup came in cups .
no biggie , i 'll take the other half home for a midnight snack .
still no sign of the soup !
still no soup !
never again big jim , never again !
actually , more like a _num_ .
we left a bit disappointed .
my husband and i split the chicken parm hoagie ... good , not great .
it was really bland , and the au jus , even more so .
however our little one ordered buttered noodles and was pleased as punch .
but you ca n't eat that .
to be honest , i do n't know why i stayed .
in fact i think it got worse .
there was food under tables that looked like it was there for days .
remember , i was here for lunch and they just opened .
very old and falling apart .
i had an italian hoagie and my wife had a salad .
both tasted good but i really could n't enjoy it .
the pasta was overcooked ( but plenty of it ! )
it was a huge disappointment , and i blame fieri for that .
i do not even know where to start .
but this place is dirty .
from the front cash register to the pictures in the back dining area .
fried zucchini was really greasy and the marinara was in a plastic cup .
i know it 's not fine dining but that was never done .
staff was just ok , not outstanding as has been in the past .
no pride in the work .
this hurts my heart it write this review .
went to visit u of pittsburgh with the college bound son .
out of the way , hard to find , at night .
inside to the left is a dinning room that we walked into .
before we sat i checked the bar side and it was better .
not good but much better .
i would give it a _num_ .
he was not happy .
_num_ out of _num_ .
i ordered a bowl of wedding soup and half of a meatball hoagie .
neither of us were impressed by the lasagna .
disappointing reuben sandwich .
meat was not kosher corn beef .
did not feel comfortable here especially after eating sub standard meat .
this giant eagle gets two stars because their customer service stinks .
my husband and i shop at giant eagle at least once a week .
she indicated i could not buy gift cards without id .
i will not go back to this location again .
i am sure that wo n't hurt giant eagle or alicia .
but , it is the only thing under my power .
this is the worst giant eagle i 've ever been to .
if only the self check out machine would stop breaking down .
this location is significantly below par and in need of major upgrades .
it feels cramped inside .
this pizza tastes like pizza .
finally seated , i was excited to try the food .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
`` $ _num_ plus tip please . ''
the vets and vet staff were adequate .
we would strongly recommend east end vet .
then they seriously asked us if we can wait _num_ hours ?
no call back .
i said no , it is my first time .
very very very bad attitude .
i do n't know why you guys give them _num_ stars .
the bagel was mediocre , a little bit old but whatever .
the drink was overpriced , but whatever .
anyway , she did n't know if there were nuts in it or not .
not impressed by the food or service .
it took me ten minutes to get a bagel and cream cheese .
i would not recommend this location to anyone .
so that 's _num_ wrong and long orders per week .
this was the worst dining experience i had in ages .
no apology and a total lie .
$ _num_ for fake crab ?
ridiculous .
i did n't like the honey mustard dipping sauce .
i ordered one months earlier via delivery and was highly disappointed .
i immediately threw the sub out .
the gentleman behind the counter told us it would take _num_ minutes .
the pizza was terrible .
i could n't even eat any more after my first bite .
the bottom of the pizzas were burnt and neither had any flavor at all .
as far as an italian sub that 's a little hard to screw up .
after seeing that , i will never , never , never eat there again .
do n't get me wrong .
but this location ca n't compare to the others i 've been to .
dirty men 's room .
unsure of who our server was .
no one returned to fill coffee .
noisy .
disappointing after so many strong reviews .
there are better options .
the eggs were hard and over cooked .
the only entree that was decent were the hotcakes .
all in all we wo n't be back for a long time .
i have no idea why this place gets such good reviews .
the food is completely ordinary and completely overpriced .
i had a turkey club sandwich for ~ $ _num_ .
the sandwich was ok , nothing special .
and the sides - wait , there were no sides .
for $ _num_ , i got just a small deli sandwich .
my child got a chicken sandwich for ~ $ _num_ .
for $ _num_ .
it was n't even due for two more months !
overall , i 'd stay away from this place .
from what i 've experienced , he seems very sketchy .
she still did n't acknowledge my wanting to drop off a script .
i walked in and did n't see one employee .
it was quite strange .
i walked up to the register and the cashier looked so miserable .
still , i 'm glad i can say i did it .
$ _num_ for a round trip which took less than _num_ min each way .
$ _num_ round trip for _num_ .
lady at payment window says `` exact payment . ''
not $ _num_ not $ _num_ , $ _num_ exactly !
if you do n't have exact , then your screwed .
when you get to the bottom there is absolutely nothing to do whatsoever .
very poorly managed .
i 'm not surprised that the operator at the bottom does n't touch money .
it would n't be too much to ask for someone to make change .
if you 're not with the program , you 're an idiot .
i 've checked off my things to do list and will now move on .
the museum was really disappointing .
assume you ride both ways in which case it 's a $ _num_ experience .
i was disappointed .
terrible customer service .
called for parking directions and the girl that answered was really rude .
the workers working there had bad attitude .
although the view is nice , but they made the trip a worst nightmare .
such rudeness and racist is unacceptable .
no second time .
this is ridiculous .
bad , bad , bad experience .
ridiculous !
the employees were not welcoming .
it looked like they only wanted to earn their money and go home .
washington we looked for places to eat and most of them were closed .
so , i would not recommend this place for families who have kids .
- parking will cost you .
- surly and indifferent staff .
nothing short of diner fare .
okay food , okay service , nothing you would n't expect from a diner .
no parking near this place , pay lot on shiloh .
terrible food .
so i opted for sausage gravy and biscuits .
so sadly j & j is off the future weekend list .
so i ordered the seafood bisque .
the seafood bisque had a decent flavor , but was way too salty .
the food was average , the service was slow and the decor was old .
instead we received a choice of fruit or chicken noodle soup .
and would a choice be too much to expect ?
the main courses we chose were the filet with mushrooms and the ocean platter .
the lobster tail was cooked correctly , being the single item prepared as expected .
the scallop themselves were cold in the middle and had very little flavor .
the deserts were just ok - dry chocolate cake and decent baklava .
i remember the tin angel of the 80s and 90s .
hardly anyone there but us and another party .
the vast majority of tables empty .
first , unfriendly wait staff should be replaced with eager enthusiastic servers .
until then , i will not be back .
first off , it was n't terrible .
bar is not well stocked .
they were thrown off because i wanted the wine menu first .
the soup and fruit starters were above average .
still , it was n't overly rich and overall was acceptable if not forgettable .
we wo n't be returning and i was very disappointed .
they would not let us in because our children are under _num_ .
_num_ years ago , this may have been a great restaurant .
unfortunately , they could n't seat us for the 7:00 reservations that we requested .
my husband and i decided to stop in after looking at their menu online .
i guess i was so embarrassed that i just walked out .
and i repeated myself , may i speak to the manager ?
i then asked , could i speak to the owner please ?
`` i do n't know he 's in an out .
i really need to know a time to call the owner directly . ''
this place is a rough one to hang out in .
needless to say , our stay here was uncomfortable and short .
this place is your average hole in the wall dive bar .
terrible customer service - very rude .
it tasted like berry flavored water .
they refused .
this business is not deserving of your business .
poor selection , poor service , cash only , pricey for soft serve .
absolutely horrible service !
horrible service , mediocre ice cream .
owner was extremely rude and rang up our bill incorrectly .
this place is a total rip off .
for a cash only joint , this place is a total waste .
there are n't that many options and their serving size is pathetic .
i nearly paid $ _num_ for like _num_ bites of soft serve ice cream .
i do not recommend !
the absolute worst !
they obviously know nothing about customer service !
the owner is so rude !
he seemed annoyed that we even stepped in .
the ice cream itself is nothing special .
the worst part about it was it was n't even cold .
my frozen yogurt was already melting by the time i was handed my cone .
it 's too big . ''
and the ice cream is very plain .
nothing to write home about !
awful attitude .
never , ever , ever would my family and i go back !
should n't be in business !
the man working was clearly miserable .
he looked as if he was annoyed to wait on me .
none of us could believe how miserable this guy is .
terrible customer service , mediocre ice cream and high prices .
i tasted the milkshake and it was not the correct flavor .
again , just bizarre .
also , there is n't anywhere to sit inside the ice cream shop .
the man makes you feel bad to order anything .
asked for napkins and he opened the window and literally threw them at me .
decided to stay in friday night and order some pizza .
pizza was under cooked and doughy .
the food is not very good but there prices are very reasonable .
the pizza is just ok .
in general though the pizza is n't anything to write home about .
i would n't recommend it .
frankly , we should have run out the door the moment we sat down .
the walls are either prison gray or white tile with literally nothing on them .
sorry to say this place was a huge let down .
if you want a quality steak you better head to longhorn .
the dining room could use some wall decor .
finally , after _num_ minutes , our appetizer arrived .
washington restaurants i know .
even the menu is confusing .
the menu was also small - perhaps only 15-20 total choices ?
awesome patio and awesome view , just do not get food .
like a bad cafeteria on top of mt .
wtf # _num_ : the bill comes and the beer was $ _num_ .
it is not .
they were not well presented and looked kinda gross .
will not return next time i am in the burgh .
so flash forward _num_ hours .
how much did this _num_ oz .
i am thinking i need to come back and try the bar .
and the service is worse than the food .
the half of the tiny piece of the steak was fat and overcooked .
the fish was mediocre .
nothing special .
he ended up taking _num_ dollars off for _num_ beers but that was it .
no apologies , no attempt to make up for it , nothing .
_num_ % of tip i left was too much for their service .
unacceptable .
but i still doubt i 'll ever be back .
sorry to see it tank .
i will never patronize this establishment again .
also , the owner is a total snob .
if you are n't a pretty lady , the bartenders are n't interested .
there are much better places to spend your hard earned money .
no one finished their meal .
they offer outdoor seating , which is a plus .
was traveling to pittsburgh and decided to grab a bite before the baseball game .
trashy , to say the least .
would never return here .
service was poor .
manager would n't even comp the apps .
not a repeat visit .
mushy wings .
incredibly slow service .
it seems like the restaurant is terribly managed now .
i 'm not sure what happened but i 'll never go back .
so i 've never been a fan .
washington because the wait at all the surrounding restaurants was insane .
it was honestly one of the worst dining experiences of my life .
first of all , the service was awful from beginning to end .
we each ordered _num_ fajitas and _num_ soft tacos .
first , the fajita only comes with steak and peppers .
we tried to eat them but they were just bad .
i noticed someone with a chicken wrap and it was huge .
but the service is horrible !
racist staff !
bad bad bad bad bad !
so bad !
very bad service , worse management !
all of our drinks were poorly made and very little alcohol .
after the most recent experience , we will not be returning .
which did n't start for _num_ hours .
he was very rude and reluctantly sat us at a larger table .
service was very slow .
i dont know how cooks can screw up an order of nachos .
i 'm thinking its fail proof .
the burger came with onion straws , bacon , cheese and burger patty .
the onion straws were terrible their sauce was too sweet like a jelly .
_num_ .
the food was not as nice as it was expected to be .
_num_ .
_num_ .
yet everything else came out a good _num_ minutes after that .
but , well , they 're not .
have no idea if the food is any good .
waited for _num_ minutes in the bar without even a hello .
the place was busy but no packed .
really , greeting a customer is n't that hard .
walked out and no one said a word .
very sad excuse for a buffet brunch .
the corn muffins were dry and crunchy .
i felt badly that this is where i celebrated my friend 's birthday .
upstairs , all alone with no one else .
it 's very respectful of you .
i 'm not kidding .
i 've even got my father coming to the harris for bacon night .
not so much .
you just cant go wrong w the mac n cheese ever .
it too so long to get the check i just paid and left .
i 'll not go back , i 'm going to stick w the harris .
why only _num_ stars ?
the mac and cheese was super expensive and lackluster .
it was n't thick , hardly any flavor , and just bland .
likely wo n't be visiting here again .
food was horrible .
fries were spicy , everything was made spicy .
the dcor is dark , probably so you ca n't see the bad food .
could n't wait to leave , definitely not recommending this place .
the fries are incredibly salty almost inedible .
however it does n't describe the food very well .
it smelled and tasted like pizza rather than a quesadilla .
our server never , never asked us what we wanted to drink .
not once throughout our whole meal .
out of that too .
_num_ minutes later , still no appetizer .
we said we 'd pass on the appetizers so she walked away .
nonetheless , i ordered a turkey burger and he ordered a mushroom burger .
jim is the entire reason i did n't give the place one star .
he should be running the place , really .
we did n't complain because at this point , oh well .
in the past year or two has gone downhill .
two years ago i would have readily given them _num_ stars .
they are still _num_ star and live up to my expectations .
but then we ended up waiting another half an hour with still no seats .
the whole experience was just very disappointing .
very very disappointed in this place , where do i begin .
the service was terrible .
i was surprised that this place was just that bad .
thumbs down .
short rib tacos had no flavor other than spice .
grilled veggies tasted cold and _num_ hours ago .
the flour tortillas tasted like they were sitting out for a few .
on a scale of _num_ to _num_ , they get a minus _num_ .
the wait for our food , after having been seated , was absolutely unacceptable .
the quality , preparation , and presentation of the food was poor .
i 'll not return any time soon .
it was not busy at the bar , and we were ignored .
sorry but i will never be back at the shiloh grill !
worst treatment ever and it was my birthday !
i was here around 2:30 on a monday .
if they had been busy , i get it .
i would n't have questioned it .
i wo n't be back .
we would 've been easy guests who generally are quite generous with the tips .
shiloh grill has proved a disappointment yet again and this review still stands true .
today our friend suggested it so _num_ of us went out together .
why is your kitchen open if you have no food ?
but a party of _num_ ?
even so , you should have food for _num_ people in a night .
came here for sunday brunch and was not impressed .
the quality of food is not good .
then factor in the $ _num_ price point and it tastes even worse !
it actually hurt my lips and stomach .
i really wanted to like this place .
sad experience .
plain and simple : the food leaves something to be desired .
it 's just that the food was so forgettable .
for a `` _num_ star '' rating , i 'd expect better .
my dining companion had already been there and i honestly was n't that interested .
not what you 'd expect on mount washington .
the hostess was just cold as ice .
night ruined !
so i will never patronize that restaurant again .
there are far too many other places that want the business .
for all the hype , was very disappointed with the experience .
the actual building itself is in horrible shape , although the view is amazing .
now , this restaurant was a completely disappointing experience .
my husband ordered a _num_ vintage red from the wine list .
what our server brought was a _num_ .
scallops were ok but the broccoli was too burnt .
food ... for a fine dining is bad .
for that reason alone , i would not go back .
not disappointed , either .
( and what a horrible impression to leave your diner with ! )
went here for a business dinner tonight .
view was fabulous , but would have been better if they washed the windows .
the butternut squash tasted like almond paste .
my husband 's crab claws arrived at the table , hardly cracked .
the waiter returned quickly enough , full of apology .
the second time i went , my salad had a hair in it .
i 've never made reservations for the dining room .
unfortunately , a table opened up .
he apologized and cleared the table and sent our waitress over .
when our food came out it was cold .
not even under a heat lamp cold .
it was just cold .
and fish is not very tasty cold .
my scallops were gritty and missing ingredients listed on the menu .
the decor is just cheesy and lame .
fake painted palm trees ?
( lets not forget about the elevator ride ) .
everything else is just terrible .
i will happily eat rare meat , but rare duck is awful .
she argued with me that i was wrong and should n't be doing that .
$ _num_ later , i left the restaurant frustrated and disappointed .
thus the food only gets one star .
unfortunately , it was all down hill from there .
even the butter for the bread was salted almost too much !
there is just no arguing that the monterey bay fish grotto has amazing views .
again , disappointing .
chilean seabass with korean bbq preparation .
when i think seabass i think flaky , buttery tasting fish .
this was kinda dry and mostly tasteless .
maybe they cooked it too long , i dunno ?
but it didnt taste like anything special , especially for $ _num_ .
probably the worst seabass i 've had to be honest .
the mac and cheese was runny and just not that good .
of all the things this was probably the best ... of the worst .
the salmon chunks that came with it were ok .
nothing special .
regardless , i just ca n't recommend you eat here .
my dish was a serious mess .
there was absolutely no flavor , and my fish was severely overcooked .
i was pretty unhappy ( understatement of the day ) .
sad times all around .
the food is okay but very expensive .
the message i got was essentially `` not our fault '' .
no caring whatsoever .
there 's nothing hanging on the walls .
the cut was thin , the taste bland .
the sauce was runny and just did n't do it .
they gave me lime that looked like it was sitting out for days .
i could n't even squeeze a drop of lime juice put of it .
horrible service and cheap food trying to be passed off as high end .
however , his service was not so remarkable .
did n't give us water until almost _num_ minutes later .
i was very disappointed .
food was good but unfortunately i will not go back .
asked for window table - denied although there were several empty tables .
now , there is a table wait list .
poor waitress could n't reach far enough to serve the meal or clear plates .
the remodel is grey , drab .
no handicap bathroom on dining floor after remodel .
nice ambiance and view , but their cooking fell short .
our red snapper and swordfish were both over cooked and dry .
very disappointing considering the price charged .
unfortunately , that was not the case this time .
my husband ordered the stuffed shrimp which included _num_ petite overcooked shrimp .
our waitress was arrogant .
prices were way too high for the quality provided .
grilled wedge was ok at best .
dry salty just disgusting .
my only regret was not returning the _num_ dollars dish .
i ate garbage .
i would stick to the chilean sea bass .
but the food was unimpressive to say the least .
the other only good note was the service .
so i 've been here many times and it just keeps getting worse .
do n't bother .
the food is ridiculously overpriced and mediocre at best .
it 's not that it was bad , just boring and no big deal .
the place itself is old , run down and dirty .
really , really disappointing .
the veal was so overpowered with garlic !
i like a little garlic but this was overwhelming !
the french onion soup had no melted cheese on top .
the spinach salad was very bland !
i will not go back !
do not waste your time or money .
i 'm not making this up !
zucchini appetizer was slightly burned .
spinach salad with hot bacon dressing had cold bacon dressing .
this was all followed by the worst steak i have ever been served .
the market should not allow for such poor food and service .
they are only getting _num_ stars because of the view .
they seriously need improvement and it was disappointing .
i have been here once before and it seemed okay .
i am taking my husband here for his birthday tonight strictly for the view .
do n't even bother !
mediocre food ( avoid the steak at all costs . )
the wallpaper is peeling off the walls and the wall are dirty .
the carpet is a mess .
essentially , this place is making money because of the view .
if it did n't have the view , they would 've closed months ago .
you 'll get the same view , better food and better service .
bad service , mediocre food but a great view .
but we never got to find out .
we arrived for our _num_ dinner reservation and at _num_ was still not seated .
after i paid in cash , i went to use the restroom .
when i came out , she said i did n't pay the whole price .
other than that , the food was bland ; too much butter on everything .
bad service .
food is mediocre .
service is mediocre .
horrible decor , mediocre to poor service , and bad food .
such a shame .
terrible terrible service !
service was soooo slow .
the food was overpriced and less than desirable .
the butter did n't help much .
baked potato was microwaved .
a baked potato will be crispy on the outside .
this is a direct result of the baking .
a microwaved potato will be one big rubbery mess that slides around your plate .
the tip was n't much .
the interior is weird .
she never returned to check up on us .
the baked potato was also dense .
if you are looking for good food this is not the place .
the only thing that deserves the second star is the view .
the food is crappy .
cheap food prepared poorly .
i think i 've experienced better flavor at taco bell .
what a joke , _num_ crackers with some room temp walmart cheese .
can everyone in this establishment just get on the same page ?
the ny strip steak was about as poor quality as it could get .
the baked potato was over cooked .
looked almost like it was left over from the previous day .
took almost _num_ 1/2 hrs for dinner when there were only about _num_ tables .
staff does not reflect the price of the food .
i would rather go to texas roadhouse .
all of our entrees were overcooked or undercooked .
do n't waste your time !
i was so wrong .
it was over _num_ degrees inside .
my face was sweating after _num_ minutes .
i was uncomfortable the entire time as were my family members .
the waiter never mentioned the price of the specials .
needless to say , he left hungry .
it 's a shame , but , i wo n't go back .
i assume that maybe just meant a long wait for food .
the server was no where to be found at times .
went here on a slow weeknight .
i wish i could say the same for the food .
bread ... brought it out , i was late .
gross .
false .
i dunno , i expected flavor .
it was very blah .
maybe i like things too flavorful ?
not a family / kid friendly place .
food was bland and service was horrible .
would not recommend this place .
i was quite satisfied with it but it was still too much for me .
this place does n't even deserve _num_ star .
never have i ever experienced terrible service like this .
pathetic .
there were no traditional italian dishes .
we walked out - never willing to give it another shot .
caprese salad was ice cold & laying in a river of olive oil .
olive garden has better food .
meal was very disappointing .
my sauce tasted burnt and it was lacking flavor .
it was not good .
i was just very underwhelmed .
i do n't even know where to start .
we sat there for _num_ minutes without any sign of a waitress .
she comes back _num_ minutes later .
no exaggeration .
she flat out says she forgot about us and laughs it off .
overall this place was awful .
it also was so loud we could barely hear each other talk .
washington , there is no reason to make the trip here .
small portions , nothing outstanding on the menu , and mediocre service .
i was looking forward to it too and was quite disappointed .
the owner at that time apologized and told me she would refund me immediately .
very unprofessional not to mention against pa consumer laws .
walked out and told the hostess this was ridiculous .
the calamari was very chewy although the flavor was good .
the only thing memorable was the rack of lamb .
ambiance was terrible .
i got my penne in vodka sauce which was so incredibly salty .
the `` chicken '' was soggy and a little rubbery .
the lava sauce the general tso was drenched in was unbearable .
i will never patronize my little buddies restaurant again .
food was terrible .
not fresh , not good .
i would never go back but purely because the food was terrible .
we ordered food here as we walked around the area .
the place was dead ( should have been a red flag ) .
this food was unbearable once again .
i got it a _num_ this time and it was hotter than before .
so i 'll write a review to stay away .
just stay away , bad food , do n't come here , move on .
i ordered the vegetable fried rice for the take out meal .
the waiter ( owner , chef ? )
this guy never even looked there .
this place has gone completely downhill since my last review .
they do not provide good quality food items anymore .
how awful of a business owner are you ?
i am never coming back here again .
i ca n't go below _num_ , otherwise it 's a _num_ .
horrible customer service !
picture that disgusting dish rack .
it 's not .
bottom line : avoid this place .
this place is not good .
maybe it was in the _num_ 's but not today .
and the bread is nasty .
i give it _num_ greasy stale buns out of _num_ .
probably should have got the fries folks were raving about .
should have gotten fountain soda as bottles were warm .
maybe next time i 'll get the italian sub as it looked good .
not a good scene .
besides that , the subs are not worth your calories .
they barely look at you and never thank you .
sadly ... .
)
if you 're not a regular , then you will be made to wait .
it 's a shame because the food & decor are fairly good .
however , the haircut i received was much too short .
this is very unprofessional .
anyway , i am extremely disappointed in how my hair came out .
he did not oil my scalp , he did n't section my hair .
if there is an issue , they normally refund the client .
never go to this place , it is not worth the headache .
fact : a business is responsible for what it 's staff does and says .
if possible , i 'd like to resolve this over the phone .
they give every guy the exact same haircut no matter what you ask for .
unacceptable .
horrible hotel .
do n't stay here unless you absolutely have to .
this is what i get for letting other people book my hotel reservation .
it was awful .
the rooms all come with a microwave , stove and a fridge .
the main problem with it is that it is so noisy .
screaming children , people walking around upstairs at all hours .
worst residence inn i have ever stayed in .
windows do n't seal so any noise from the outside comes in .
i like residence in but this facility is a disaster .
this is the worst residence inn marriott that i have ever stayed in .
the room was very hot and stuffy .
furniture was ripped and torn .
ca n't be sanitary .
very disappointed with this stay .
i rented a car on may _num_ returned it may _num_ .
_num_ .
well that was very bad also .
no one cared that the tire could have fallen off .
i 'm very unhappy with your service .
sure this will not matter .
food was so-so , but for half off it 's hard to complain .
i 've only been here on nights during the school year and -- yikes .
poor service .
very crowded even on a weekday in the summer time .
not personable , not nice .
go for drinks , pass on the food .
not happy with management decisions .
also the mixed drinks are watered down and taste terrible .
she was rude and racist .
carpet , in a bar , even in the dining room ... questionable .
food came pretty quickly but fries were cold !
this is a difficult review to write .
the museum part of the attraction is disappointing .
i was bored with my tour .
i wish the museum was far better .
you ca n't please everyone .
i got ripped off from them like crazy .
_num_ ) the garbage area always smells so bad .
garbage is always overflowing .
ridiculous .
i feel bad for the managers though , they came and left every year .
i was in and out within _num_ minutes .
i would n't bother with this place .
they put tomato sauce on it ?
another example of bad italian food in pittsburgh .
the food is sub-par for a traditional restaurant .
i guess the pitt students like it for the price and convenient location .
joe mama 's is just lacking too many things .
overall , look elsewhere , there are better places very , very close by .
the food is italian , but pretty uninspired .
olive garden is better , and i really do n't like olive garden .
the drinks are pretty standard cocktails , but not particularly strong or reasonably priced .
the atmosphere is ... annoying ?
i 'm not sure why i dislike it so much , but i do .
i 've tried their pizza which is ok .
i usually get the spaghetti and meatballs which is a half pound meat ball .
and it 's just _num_ which pissed me off .
you could at least put like _num_ half pound meatballs on my plate .
i probably had one of my worst restaurant experience here .
the food was ok ... but i could 've made better pasta .
i wish i could give _num_ stars .
spinach wrap for lunch was disgusting .
went for lunch again for a meeting .
fucking disgusting .
everything here is kind of so-so .
heck , nothing here has ever not disappointed me .
nothing was specifically awful , but nothing was good either .
nothing special .
however , the first floor and bathrooms always smell like sewage .
in fact , this restaurant always feels straight up dirty .
had spinach alfredo pizza that lacked much taste .
i should have listened to my fellow yelpers because this place is not good .
i called it a mistake .
just do n't , but if you do remember i warned you .
the service was friendly and relatively fast but the food was mediocre .
pretty much everything was downhill from there , though .
then another _num_ minutes for her to come get the card .
this food at this place is not good .
it was really lacking flavors and the vegetables just felt thrown in .
i would definitely not get a pasta dish though .
service was pretty lackluster , despite it being a slow time .
unfortunately , the same can not be said for joe mama 's .
extremely mediocre .
chicken was poorly seasoned fries had that freezer dried texture .
i am so confused .
i had the falafel gyro and it was definitely not that good .
definitely cheap though .
tasted like frozen falafel or something -- bland , basically .
but if this is pittsburgh 's best falafel then i am a sad man .
worst experience of my life !
the coupon also said that they offered toppings for $ _num_ .
waited _num_ minutes for a pineapple and olive pizza .
pathetic .
a bunch of clowns sitting in an office with their thumbs in their ears .
and they still kept $ _num_ of my promised $ _num_ return .
unfortunately , you do n't really have any other options .
and she called me and left a message _num_ minutes before i walked in .
jerry : i do n't understand .
rental car agent : i think i know why we have reservations .
jerry : i do n't think you do .
horrible !
i would give zero stars if possible !
i do n't smoke and i have a one year old .
this is the second time i 've rented from enterprise @ this pittsburgh location .
additionally , i was asked if i wanted extended coverage on the vehicle .
i did call after reviewing the emailed receipt , and the charges were removed .
the view out my window was a ruin of a chevrolet dealer .
the lady at the front desk did n't give us good directions .
it was weird .
other than that , we wo n't be back !
i am sure where they were and am sure they were stolen .
very frustrating to have $ _num_ sunglasses stolen .
then sent us to some sketchy place in a terrible neighborhood instead .
rip off .
we reserved _num_ beds and got _num_ bed .
it was a terrible night !
i 'm quite confused at the high reviews for this place .
the sushi here is nothing to be excited about .
it 's not fresh , bland , and the selection is rather limited .
cheap sushi , but not very good .
the rolls fell apart and the wasabi was really low quality .
first impression ... these folks do n't want my business !
the lady at the counter was beyond rude !
the red snapper here was beyond horrible !
simply put : the sushi here was not good .
i tried three separate rolls here , all of which disappointed .
terrible , preparation was sloppy , taste was mediocre .
sushi rolls fell apart .
i can get a salmon roll and an avocado roll for about $ _num_ .
_num_ ) i am meeting a friend for lunch on campus .
unfortunately , none of them were good .
the california rolls were made of very low quality imitation crab .
this place was pretty disappointing .
the rolls were flavorless .
sushi boat , oh how you have disappointed me in the past few months .
but recently , you 've changed .
racist racist racist .
gross .
rude and arrogant .
is there an option for no stars ?
their customer service is horrible and their pizza is horrible .
it does n't even sit under a heat lamp .
disappointing ... .
sauce tasted terrible , almost too salty .
my girlfriend said she would give it _num_ stars if she could .
that 's a tough one and a half mile stretch of road .
_num_ hours for cold pizza .
if it were possible to give this place _num_ stars , i would .
so rude .
the items are hit or miss , and lackluster .
in a pinch , but i 've had much better asian food .
i 'm with matt l. on this one .
the service is the absolute worst .
the reason for the _num_ stars is the smoothies .
i do n't know why lulu 's is so popular .
the food over all just is n't that authentic or tasty .
the kim chi is subpar .
some people do n't like taro chunks in theirs .
i had one of the worst meals in pittsburgh at lulu 's .
it was disgusting .
it also had canned tomatoes , and no basil .
however not in this case .
great prices , average to terrible food .
avoid the pho , it 's not even close to real pho !
do n't want to take my debit card at 4pm ?
food is n't worth the b.s .
big mistake .
i ordered the bbq pork noodle bowl , and bob the boyfriend ordered ramen .
the food came out fast enough , so no complaints there .
but the real problem was the miso broth itself .
it was so salty it was almost inedible .
certainly not bland this time , though !
it was a depressing , bad experience .
hold out for rose tea or anything , really -- anything else .
i dont hate lulu but some of their dishes can be really bad .
i always wonder why every chinese eateries has singapore rice noodles on their menu ?
just do n't ever order singapore rice noodles anywhere including lulu .
it 's so horrible .
lulu 's really not fantastic .
other than this i do n't eat any other dishes from there .
big portions , pretty fast .
i hate to say but ... it 's not me , it 's you .
service is slow , like your momma slow .
everyone who works here has soo much attitude its beyond belief .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
life is too short to be rude all the time .
yuck , yuck , yuck .
i had the spicy basil noodle plate which tasted like ragu on rice noodles .
my ma po tofu tasted like it came out of a can .
unfortunately , i wo n't be coming back here again .
it was not good .
i did n't expect great service , and i was n't wrong .
to be honest , lulu does not deserve any stars .
the food here is mediocre at best .
the food is either too bland or overly salty .
i ordered the thai curry chicken and was not particularly impressed with the dish .
all in all , it was way off the mark .
the vegetables were bland and salty .
there is a reason why the prices are cheap .
the food is not plentiful nor high quality , and the service is terrible .
the only thing really going for it is the bubble tea .
their pho is terrible .
they also used the wrong noodles in the tasteless broth .
tried lulu 's again .
gross .
food is good , but service is terribly terrible !
lulu 's is mediocre at best .
i tried the pan fried crispy noodles with chicken and the pad thai .
both were disgusting !
i actually had to return the pan fried noodles because it was not edible .
i order pad thai every chance i get and this was not good .
the pork in my soup was overcooked and chewy .
i would n't order their soup again .
i 'd drink it again in a pinch but would rather search elsewhere .
the service was terrible and for that alone i would n't return .
i got the lunch special , it was terrible .
meat seemed low quality .
actually one star is still too high to them .
first of all , their service is very awful .
every time i went there , i felt bad .
however , today i was starving and want to have pat thai so bad .
therefore , i went there and i realized that there is nothing changed .
i wo n't go back this restaurant never again .
this place is really horrible .
the soup was tasteless .
do yourself a favor and skip this place .
i do n't see what all the hype is about .
there is nothing special about this restaurant , it is mediocre at best .
the service is also poor .
cafeteria korean , thai , and chinese culinary low end .
slow bad service , kind of dirty , stale environment .
these were all bland boring , nothing special and never ordered again .
no bubbles for me , and no more lulu 's either .
there is ample seating which was nice so we sat immediately .
their food is mediocre at best but service has been okay .
the food is cheap and passable .
service is slow but usually friendly .
the slow service was a good excuse to take a long break from work .
fishy !
i really was wondering if he mixed our order with someone else 's .
and , honestly , it 's a pretty weak two .
me and my doctor girlfriend ?
but , it was totally meh .
and , the basil dish was spicy but not all that flavorful .
sorry , lulu 's .
i would n't go back .
first the bad .
i ordered the korean bibimbap bowl with duck .
the bowl was topped with kimchi and duck .
the duck was greasy but tasty and the kimchi was a little dry .
too much rice .
maybe next time i 'll just get mango smoothies and onion pancakes .
terrible food !
however , the food here is terrible .
overall , the food is just questionable .
the tofu was mushy .
and there were no bean sprouts .
the one plus side is that this place is really , really cheap .
unfortunately , that 's one of the only good things .
one of my friends told that the pad thai here is her absolute favorite .
firstly , it was really nothing like real pad thai .
absolutely no seasoning or flavor .
i was really disappointed with my food .
i really want to like this place .
the food is just not very good .
their brown sauce is heavy , like gravy .
plus the service is almost nonexistent .
terrible experience and we didnt even get to eat .
we felt like no one was willing to wait on us and were offended .
so after waiting for _num_ minutes we walked out and will never go back .
i 've tried several of their dishes and only like one .
however , the food is terrible .
too speedy .
how wrong we were .
definitely made us feel very very rushed .
rude .
could use more bubbles though .
it 's cheap .
the chicken seemed to be of low quality .
i also ordered a side of fried rice which was bland and unappealing .
the worst pad thai noodles ever !
it is not suppose to taste sweet .
worst than eating a bag of candy .
otherwise , standard menu , sub-par food , and sub-par service .
as usual , let 's start with the bad news .
there was n't a whole lot of service here outside placing your order .
the food was mediocre with some good in it .
the food was flavorless and overcooked .
but the worst thing of all was how disgusting the place was .
everything had a nasty film on it .
it is the worst restaurant i have never experienced .
oh c'mon , are u kidding me ?
and it is just not the real twice cooked pork !
if this restaurant runs in china , c'mon , people will kill it .
fail .
i also put sriracha and and black vinegar on it .
the service is generally horrible .
it 's slow and just ... annoying .
the good thing about this place is that it 's cheap .
however , the pluses stop there .
worst service ever , beyond rude .
sorry lulu 's it 's nothing personal .
they charge an average amount for some less than decent food .
i really did n't like lulu 's at all .
their food was terrible .
just overall a terrible experience .
_num_ stars for the food and _num_ for the service .
lulu 's has gone seriously downhill in the last few years .
- had to ask for napkins twice to no avail .
hello , where 's my waitress ?
chopsticks arrived _num_ minutes after noodles did .
- beef pho was absolutely inedible - lukewarm , flavorless , disgusting .
the only tasty thing at lulu 's is the sriracha sauce .
no , i will never go here again .
it 's a shame .
bathroom is not to be used even in emergency situations .
it is also usually very crowded which can slow the the already shady service .
when i went here last week , it was terrible .
this is not the lulu 's i remember .
they 've substituted unique dishes with cheap , low quality ingredients .
no amount of sriracha could save how poorly made it was .
bubble tea : worst bubble tea i 've ever had .
then the boba was hard , and there were hardly any in there !
honestly , i had to spit them out they were so bad .
it 's just not good in general .
so i came to get _num_ mango smoothie bubble tea today .
based on my past experience with other people there , i might come back .
in addition , i felt ill before i left the restaurant .
i will not be returning .
dirty environment and waitress was so rude to us .
the waitress was really impatient when we asked for checking in second time .
really flavorless food .
so disappointing .
it is hard to make take out noodles tasteless .
maybe it is because we ordered it with no msg ?
i do n't know , but i wo n't be coming back here again .
overall food was crappy .
the service at lulu 's seems extremely disorganized .
avoid this place .
it 's no longer that place .
bland & tasteless , overly oily , and just bad .
bad bad bad .
so disappointed .
i wish it was a little quicker and cleaner overall .
it just makes me wonder what passes as `` sanitary '' in their kitchen .
pathetic does n't even begin to describe it .
bad service !
food is bland !
a couple side dishes are edible , i guess ... .
like other reviewers , i 'm unimpressed by lulu 's noodles .
there are several better options ( see my craig st. restaurant list ) .
lunch does not include table service .
any way , better luck next time .
this was the first time i did not take my leftovers home !
my colleague ordered the pad thai and the balance of flavors were completely off .
they forgot my order , i waited _num_ minutes for my bubble tea .
the worst attitude i have ever experienced .
wings and crab rangoon are crispy .
why am i here .
try rose tea or even oriental express .
- variety
this really is n't a place where you should try something new .
we came here for lunch and the experience was not very enjoyable .
the food did n't take long to come out .
i had lulu 's pan fried noodles and it was just bland and boring .
there was not much chicken in it and only one mushroom !
it was mainly cheap rice noodles with sauce and green veggies .
all in all i left so unimpressed that i wo n't be returning .
the food is sub-par .
the prices have n't changed much in _num_ years .
i recently i went there and ordered the szechuan chicken noodle bowl .
they use to offer a sauce with their crab rangoon ... no more .
horrible service .
it does n't exist .
staff all need to be trained asap if they want to stay in business .
nothing to write home about .
they 've slowly gotten worse .
wo n't be going back .
even the bubbles in the bubble tea were gross and soggy .
i guess its redeeming qualities were that it 's cheap and convenient .
but with two other asian restaurants close by , why bother .
extremely mediocre asian food .
it 's got chinese , japanese , thai , viet , etc .
i also got a coffee flavored bubble tea that tasted like bitter chinese medicine .
ick .
the harsh reality of this restaurant is that it 's underwhelming .
server was friendly and assisted me in ordering .
i ordered thai lemon beef on noodles .
as soon as i saw it , my appetite disappeared .
this is probably true because there was no one in there when i went .
there were humongous ice chunks and barely any bubbles !
there was no real mango , just flavoring .
i expected spicy thai curry but no real flavor , just bland .
the chicken was tasteless on both meals .
lulu 's used to be my favorite eatery in oakland .
this was on a sunday night , in the summer ( i.e .
it was a bad start for the night , for the sure .
but it was tasteless compared to what it used to be .
my bbq pork soup , however , was really not good .
i really do n't know what is going on with this place .
_num_ years ago it used to be a favorite of mine .
their meat is completely bizarre .
i ordered a mango & strawberry jasmine green tea boba with normal sweetness .
for $ _num_ , it is overpriced .
as for the entre , i had the dr. fu special .
the dish was mediocre .
the dr. fu special had too much noodles and lacked any vegetables .
also boba tea is nothing like boba but just some melted ice .
no recommendation on this restaurant .
i will never step foot in this place again !
horrible .
ordered a noodle bowl two veggie egg rolls and tom yum soup .
tom yum soup just broth , with four or five floating mushroom slices .
have n't been here for quite awhile .
the food is just gross .
the first i ordered take out and ended up throwing it in the trash .
the second i ate in , but actually could n't eat much of anything .
there wo n't be a third time .
after this meal i will not be giving them a third chance .
i wish zero stars was a choice .
subpar asian food in an extremely noisy cafeteria setting .
the plus side of this restaurant is that it is fast and cheap .
do not go here if you want authentic chinese food .
there are many other asian restaurants near by for better price and quality !
-the food is mediocre .
if you want good food in the area , go to little asia .
-the service is crazy slow -- i 've never had things not be slow .
-they play obnoxious music outdoors ( but not inside !
not very impressed .
hyped up fast food chinese restaurant , american style .
food is average , price is higher with no service .
ridiculous for a `` cleaners '' .
disappointed thrifty 's , and i 'm sorry to break up with you .
i must say , it is you , not me this time .
we had a good run , but we 've grown apart .
i 've been loyal , but deserve better right now .
do not go here for alterations .
i don ' t think this is unreasonable .
excuse me ?
if you want quick , cheap , sloppy alterations done , go here .
the only redeeming aspects are the price and quick turnaround .
he kept ignoring me to help other customers , which was rude .
this place blows .
if i could give is zero stars , i would .
and there were only like _num_ people in the bar .
bottom line : there are better places .
expect crowds , with loud loud music and lots of smoke .
no , really .
the drink selection itself is laughable .
it 's just awful then .
some dude was passed out in a chair for a half hour .
seriously , do n't go here unless you have to .
there are better , cheaper bars in oakland .
service is horrible .
just plain nasty this place is .
there are n't that many bars in oakland to choose from .
makes me wonder if i was that bad back when i was in college .
service was slow at times .
service is very slow .
bad service and bad food !
i have n't been here in awhile and made a stop in last night .
the service was n't that great either .
this place just keeps getting worse .
this was a dive bar , obviously catering to students .
service was terrible for food !
and my friend only got _num_ slices of turkey .
they do n't give you any meat at all .
it 's a shame .
it had a huge amount of onion , which was disgusting .
avoid .
now ... after a shower ... i hate it even more .
i seriously probably had this haircut in the 3rd grade .
im sorry but really disappointed with the hair cut .
cried when i got back cause it looked ridiculous .
but it is pricey ( for ice cream i mean ) .
horrible , rude service .
terrible .
my favorite is the mexican chocolate ( chocolate with a spicy bite ! )
for one , it is centrally located in `` university alley . ''
sometimes the crowds i see deter me from going in .
first , they charge _num_ cents for paying with a card .
i just do n't think getting ice cream should be such a big ordeal .
sorry dave and andy 's , i 'll probably go elsewhere .
not sure why there are so many favorable reviews .
unfortunately this place is not worth going out of the way for .
the service is just super bad .
the owner said all kinds of excuses and was very rude .
their flavor choices are always boring .
do n't ruin your brand .
but the texture leaves something to be desired .
also , be careful with their spoons .
worst ice cream ever !
i had the oreo flavor and it was awful as well .
what ruined my experience was the attitude of the server .
i went to this dealership in the hopes of purchasing _num_ cars .
there were no sales people available and they seemed very disinterested .
we did not feel like they wanted our business and chose to leave .
he did n't really apologize and did n't invite me back .
there are other choices in this area .
i always walked by this place and wondered if i should try .
one day , i went here for lunch with a bunch of coworkers .
i 've had so much better elsewhere .
it was very dry and tasteless .
the only real attraction to this place is the student pricing .
dishes here are quite cheap .
so much lamb on the menu , it 's hard to avoid .
just because it has lamb in it , does n't mean its mediterranean .
beef too dry , too well done .
for this price , you could get a lot better .
during that _num_ minutes i imagined my lunch under a heat lamp .
after maybe _num_ or _num_ minutes she came out .
or ca n't slice the meat and cook it ?
terrible service and mediocre to bad food .
so , not everything is bad .
my pathetic lunch in all it 's glory before a single bite .
bland , over cooked and greasy .
not going back here again .
i did n't even like the pita bread .
everything else i 've tried i have regretted ordering .
on top of the subpar food , the service is slow .
i stopped by for lunch with my family on a thursday .
the main reason i am rating this place two stars is their pitas .
sadly , the food usually disappoints .
we are let down to find out that they were out of hummus .
we ended up ordering some dips and two meals , lamb and chicken kabobs .
this also was dry and burnt .
so this is your basic cvs - but _num_ things i noticed here today .
just your ordinary cvs with everything bumped up in price due to convenience .
you 're just stuck standing there , moving every time someone walks in .
i found it pretty low quality , not very fresh , kind of greasy .
the staff was pretty unfriendly , i did n't feel welcome there .
i did n't eat anything but the _num_ and some of the sauce .
absolutely horrible experience .
no one from the waitstaff looked like he wanted to be there .
i should have listened to them !
yes it was the same old place but the food was pretty crappy .
service it horrible and these people working there lack major personality .
if you run a restaurant you better be a little personable .
on my most recent experience , i did not even get to eat .
blah blah blah .
i 've had much better elsewhere .
you might not get a drink refill until the end of the meal .
so i did n't freak out .
i did , however , get a new knife .
food is average .
although the manager apologized , it was still unacceptable .
this has been my choice indian restaurant for over a decade .
but the experience overall was lackluster .
this is no longer the case at indian garden .
my girlfriend ordered a drink , which was never brought out .
water was never refilled .
the meal was n't bad , but the service was awful .
my partner and i just left and were disgusted by our experience .
first of all : i waited _num_ hours for my meal .
i 'm kind of offended ... .
just no .
the food was mediocre at best .
on top of all that , we were overcharged by about _num_ dollars .
so , no , i do n't think we will be back here .
_num_ stars for water guy .
some stuff was over salted and the chicken tikka was dry .
this experience was enough for me ; i wo n't be returning .
there are better indian options a few blocks away on n. craig .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
i was so , so wrong .
i did n't find anything special about it .
( pool .
that 's why i do n't like the place .
it 's just not as good as it should be .
but it simply is n't .
however , i went back recently and was extremely disappointed .
the chicken chili had potential but it was barely warm .
to boot the restaurant was not very clean when we were there .
all in all , i had high expectations and was disappointed .
if it 's cold , try the chili .
nothing really stood out and , again , the food was really greasy .
go if you have midnight munchies and you want cheap food .
desert misses the rain .
we all flew up and out of the booth in reaction to this .
her reaction was slow .
avoid !
you need to have a drunken buzz to enjoy the food .
we were _num_ for _num_ on dinners .
bbq chicken pizza crust was burned and lacked flavor .
the pulled pork was dried out , tough and lacked taste .
lastly , the jerk chicken was too jerky .
i 'm not a fan .
my problem is the food .
it is just eh .
bummer that they could n't maintain that standard .
the waitress stole my credit card information .
the place was a typical sports bar , dimly lit .
i would 've preferred them plain .
really really disappointing .
i would have been happier if it were bland .
instead it was just plain awful .
the batter was overlooked and the steaming pile of fish within was just awful .
how to describe awful ?
foul taste .
not gon na complain but never getting food again .
ugh .
we just tried the pizzas which were too doughy and bland for my taste .
unfortunate because it smelled really good .
paid for a lot of inedible food today and that sucks .
unfortunate because it smelled really good .
paid for a lot of inedible food today and that sucks .
but if they 're no good with it , why offer it at all ?
atmosphere : it works , i guess .
one point off .
service : no complaints here .
i rated a similar bar/restaurant combo in boston ( sunset grill and tap ) .
also , this is a random side note , but i hate the menu .
what a horrible place , a nasty vibe , and inedible food .
i was irritated , but decided not to argue .
i lost _num_ inches of my hair because of this place !
i spent _num_ hours there and my hair came out orange with red roots !
spent more _num_ hours at the salon and left looking even worse .
i left there with my hair falling out and looking absolutely terrible .
they literally cooked my hair , and i lost _num_ inches of it !
it was all damaged and the color was so ugly .
i 've never regretted something as much as going to that place .
by any means , do not go there if you care about your hair .
this place is horrible .
sorry but the gyro i had yesterday ( chicken ) was terrible .
bland chicken , sad tomato and lettuce .
i would have gotten lamb but they said it was n't _num_ % lamb .
not into mystery meat .
i seriously do n't get the draw .
not going to this again .
- no breakfast sandwiches .
- bathroom requires a key ?
i guess that 's typical starbucks .
pretty crowded starbucks with the typical college crowd since it 's located in oakland .
horrible service !
the food is ... uh yeah whatever .
the coffee is pretty horrible , even the espresso drinks .
neither did the wife .
not a bad thing , but not something to recommend either .
so i can not stress enough avoid the restaurant in this holiday inn .
however , one really annoying thing about it is their vending machine situation .
the chair in the room was worn out and not comfortable .
the internet connection was very slow and difficult to use .
i thought this room was empty .
i had , but nevertheless she should n't have just opened the door .
i think that 's kind of unacceptable when check-out is 11am .
not close to much else , but that 's okay too .
pretty disappointed in the customer service .
stayed at the hotel for _num_ night .
it was gross .
instead , they microwaved it , which left it slimy and gross !
he returned it and the women seemed quiet annoyed .
worst whole wheat bagel i 've ever had .
i was starving and still could n't finish it .
yuck , would not recommend going here at all .
the bagel was thin and pretty bland .
next time i 'm going to the mcdonald 's next door .
egg and bacon were heated up in a microwave .
worst experience ever .
he was rough and did n't seem to care about how i was feeling .
i was very uncomfortable .
the other reviews look fake to me .
it 's too fluffy as pizza crust .
so very disappointed with this place .
valentine 's day pizza picked up : wrong crust , lukewarm .
pizza was cold , smashed and with incorrect toppings .
it was just not good at all .
the service was slow .
had dinner there last night and was terribly disappointed .
the sauce was terrible and seemed more like a paste than a traditional marinara .
not fresh at all .
_num_ hours and $ _num_ later and i will never return .
the fact they say they make italian food is embarrassing .
my mothers fiance could n't even finish his meal .
but this place is n't italian .
way overpriced for average food and less than average atmosphere .
the food was okay , but nothing special .
service was terribly .
so slow .
our waiter was nowhere to be seen in this half filled not busy restaurant .
could be yummy but we ca n't say since ours never came .
they were very rude .
but the entrees were ok at best .
our waiter looked angry all the time .
however , the family itself leave a lot to be desired .
i ca n't even get started on the father .
he literally does nothing for the restaurant except hang out and yell at people .
i 'm only giving them _num_ star because giving _num_ was n't an option .
gross !
no thanks !
i did n't have a great experience here .
the smell was so strong , it kind of made me sick .
so i was really hoping the food would be amazing .
by _num_ in .
the service could also have been better .
stop by after work thinking i would have a nice italy dinner .
i will not return for another meal .
the eggplant tasted old and was not to my liking .
it gets really hot in there and their drink prices are ridiculous .
i would not recommend getting drunk there .
this was a mistake .
ick .
meh , maybe i 'm just too picky .
do n't waste your money here .
unfortunately the zucchini was cooked to a mush and completely unappetizing .
the food here is not authentic at all , and it tastes pretty bad .
the worst kfc ever .
had to wait _num_ minutes before i could order .
why on earth does everyone have such a terrible attitude !
brown had an attitude from the moment we walked in .
her attitude was just beyond disgusting & rude !
very blah tasting crispy chicken to be honest .
not crispy first off and barely any meat on the wing .
ca n't see myself ever going back .
)
appointment times mean nothing to this practice .
he was extremely rude with horrible bedside manner .
i have been wanting to try this place for a long time .
the experience i had was not stellar at all .
i should have stuck to a sandwich from here .
when the salad arrived , the dressing was missing .
not like the chicken tenders at most other restaurants .
probably wo n't order from here again .
the sandwiches are dry and lacking in flavor .
i dig the creativity but it is lacking in everything else .
the wait is also ridiculous .
not to mention the people who work there are rude .
staff was rude and disrespectful .
do not order any fried food from this place .
i used to be a regular but will forever warn people of this establishment .
i placed an order for delivery : _num_ sandwiches and _num_ order of fries .
the order was _num_ hours late and ice cold .
our lunch tasted great , the service was fast but our waitress was obnoxious .
i 'm sorry but my latest experience here has been horrible .
it was overcooked and had a burnt taste .
when the owner walked by , we asked if the squid was old today .
she said its the same chef , same squid , same way .
she seems frustrated by it .
she tried one then spit it back out .
that just made things awkward for us .
the rest of the meal she did n't come back to our table .
we gave her a _num_ % tip that covered the 2nd dish and more .
but this experience left a bad taste in our mouths .
sure , her english is bad , but her attitude is worse .
yesterday evening , hoping to get a soup to comfort me .
she went away and chatted in chinese with the nearby table .
i guess she was disappointed in my order .
she left again for an extended period of time .
she brought no tea or water .
i asked about the spring rolls ; were they fried ?
it came in a very small bowl and was not hot enough .
that was effective in making me leave promptly .
i had never had such an experience at a restaurant in my life before .
miserable dinning experience .
lousy service !
do n't want to know who is cooking your food !
the food is n't bad , but that lady 's attitude is terrible .
no acknowledgement of received request .
the lady who runs the service here is extremely rude .
pretty sure she 's only not rude to people who speak cantonese .
she started yelling at us when we were only asking if it was possible .
extremely bad attitude and very obnoxious .
the food here is also not that great .
a lot of the dishes we ordered was pretty flavorless .
can definitely get better authentic chinese food elsewhere .
they also cater for large parties in their upstairs dining area .
they have such poor service .
the old guy is very rude .
worst restaurant i 've ever been to !
just plain unacceptable !
i do n't know how our server has a job .
worst service i have ever seen in my life .
avoid this place at all cost !
very poor dining service .
in hell .
that she works long hours and job ca n't complete on time .
i had no choice just to fill my stomach after the long trips .
who waitress is a owner too very rude and disgusting .
pittsburgh pa _num_ kind of feel sorry for the restaurant .
you 've been warned .
_num_ star but should really be _num_ stars .
overall decision : not worth returning to again .
i really would n't recommend this place to anyone unless they knew chinese .
that said , service by the lady was terrible .
10/10 wo n't eat here again .
love the food but this branch is a mess .
i never got the soda and the pizza box was soaked in wing sauce .
it was handed to me like that !
could n't believe it .
this pizza hut is very hit and miss , but mostly miss .
the main problem is not enough sauce .
, this was a total let down .
the service is always slow .
there also is n't much seating area and there is no atmosphere at all .
such a cute shop with great potential , but the food was pure disappointment .
it 's just a simple wrap , not much can go wrong right ?
nope , it was so bland .
there was no `` shawarma '' to my wrap .
all that cost me $ _num_ .
for a lunch special , it was quite expensive .
there are better wraps elsewhere in oakland for half the price .
i just had the worst pizza i 've ever tasted from this place .
i would 've given it zero stars if that was possible .
and the french fries on the salad were cold .
while the portion size was quite large , it was a very poor product .
decent but terribly inconsistent food .
the sauces were really thin and tasted weird .
i think i can safely say this is the worst indian food in pittsburgh .
if i return , it will only be for the buffet .
i shall not go there again .
i wo n't be back .
i wo n't press my luck by going back .
definitely the worst indian lunch buffet i 've had in pittsburgh .
selection is very limited and the taste is bland .
so gross .
will not order from here again .
it was quite watery with very little meat in it .
very disappointed in this quality for $ _num_ .
they have invited me back free of charge to give them a second try .
this is one of the worst indian food i 've had in a while .
the chicken curry was good .
the only thing i really liked about the food was the dessert .
this will leave a bad taste in your mouth .
i would not go there again .
also , my two stars for this place is solely because of the desserts .
i tried the chicken curry , the chicken tikka masala , and some rice .
the rice was so dried out , that it was almost hard .
paid over _num_ dollars and was not worth it at all .
very disappointed with their food .
i am never ordering from this place again .
just wasted my $ _num_ bucks for nothing .
i chose the chicken tikka .
the chicken chunks were rather large , moist , and shredded well .
worse food , uncooked chicken , too much oil .
never seen tikka masala too red , too oily and almost no cream .
the pizza is weird , and incredibly greasy .
the tomato sauce is too sweet .
all in all , probably the worst option for late night food .
this place is a disappointment .
it took another _num_ minutes to get to my house .
i live about _num_ minutes away .
the pizza was okay at best , just not worth a _num_ hour wait .
i will avoid this place going forward .
i had a very poor experience saturday night .
first , the pizza delivered was not what i ordered .
second , the pizza was basically inedible ... like mostly dough ... disgusting .
not much was done to right the wrong .
i like the fact that its completely self serve - no waiting for refills !
_num_ % if you truly sucked .
he has n't been there in over a year .
i ordered the roasted duck and the egg rolls .
my roasted duck , was a little bit of a disappointment .
the buffet here is incredibly lacking .
food choices are very limited .
was expecting more for a chinese buffet .
however , there are other places that are better for chinese food .
by far the worst buffet i have ever been to .
however , i thought it was strange you pay first .
my first experience eating in pittsburgh was a bad one .
i will not be returning .
not really a large selection .
food is not bad but not very flavorful .
first buffet i ever ordered dinner someplace else after going .
only few kinds of food you can eat in the buffet .
drinks usually suck .
rip , pgh cafe .
in fact i hate it .
lame .
i can guarantee that i ate it like a two year old kid .
i would n't pick it for an every day meal .
horrible customer service all around .
this mcdonald 's is so dirty .
most incompetent pharmacy i have ever been to .
it 's been _num_ minutes and counting .
it 's awkward .
the pharmacy seems to be understaffed .
this store is just , eh .
not because of the customers .
management here does n't do it properly .
i am a long standing customer of cvs and have been for years .
he screams at me that there 's a sign on the front door .
no problem . ''
that whole entire situation was completely unnecessary !
the $ _num_ large cheese pizza .
for $ _num_ a pie , how bad can it be ?
i have n't tried their hoagies , maybe they 're better .
no sorry .
no discount .
time of order was _num_ on a monday .
with every bite , i think about getting a heart attack at _num_ .
do n't expect a fantastic dining area either .
i do n't care how quick & cheap it is .
other qualities of the food included being too salty and too much sauce .
inedible general tso chicken .
fast , cheap ... for a reason .
this was one of the few restaurants that messed up chinese food .
do n't waste your money here , and get a better quality pad thai .
will not come here again !
it 's so bad .
however , the shrimp is so small and not fresh .
the tomato and vegetables like uncooked .
it seems like they are hurry to let u done .
this is unfortunately where the good things end .
the food was awful .
drowned in oil and sauce .
the meat was quite chewy and tough ( i had beef with vegetables ) .
you probably get what you pay for !
for a $ _num_ meal it was a huge portion .
the place is small , cramped , dark , and dirty .
the food is made really quickly -- under five minutes , usually .
the food itself is n't that great .
everything is either too greasy , drowning in sauce , or both .
i 've had the beef noodle soup , which is flavorful but greasy .
both the beef and broccoli and chicken and eggplant dishes had too much sauce .
do n't order the wonton soup , it has no flavor at all .
fried rice leave much to be desired .
tons of options , not very good food , but cheap .
the second star is because they are quick and cheap .
i was shocked the orange was bitter and rotten .
the food is cheap for a reason .
do n't waste your time .
food was tasteless .
both were bland .
did a rush job because there was an appointment coming in .
i saw , other customers getting foot massages , which i never got .
looked like i could have done them .
not worth it .
s & t is conveniently located in oakland .
my pedi was standard .
not great , not totally awful .
i 've never had to wait that long anywhere else before .
because this is not the one ... .
i will not be back .
_num_ days later , there was a massive chip in my polish .
she did one coat of polish over it and returned to her other client .
a gel manicure should not chip after _num_ days .
the veggie burrito was sad with undercooked pink rice and flavorless veggies .
i 've been here twice now because sometimes you just want a burrito .
however , this place serves the worst enchiladas i 've had in long time .
ick .
i ate here for the first time today .
other than that , it was completely unremarkable .
being from california i have been spoiled when it comes to mexican food .
here , i ordered a steak burrito and a horchata .
the burrito was bland and not filling .
there are n't many chips given and they too were flavorless .
food was pretty terrible honestly .
i would n't go again .
i just ca n't seem to get over the horrible wifi .
but you specialize in bagels and coffee .
when picking my bagels they only had three options of bagels .
what bagel shop is out of _num_ % of their bagels .
it 's not any particular staff , not any particular time .
mistake number two ( one being going in there in the first place ) .
the last few times i have been there the staff has been horrible .
chipotle is the better option anyways for fast food mexican in oakland .
( i suspect this is a result of having a lower customer flow ) .
to be honest , i 've never had qdoba before this point .
first off , their burrito is equally as fat as chipotle 's .
qdoba 's chicken was a bit dry and the seasoning not as flavorful .
the beans too soggy , making the whole burrito extremely soggy .
the salsa was not crisp , but mushy .
qdoba disappointed me and i will be back at chipotle tomorrow .
there 's fast food and there is sloppy food .
the qdoba is sloppy .
how sloppy you ask ?
there were very few veggies , and no extras , included in the burritos .
as it were , they wo n't be receiving my business again anytime soon .
we will probably not be frequenting this location very often .
this was not a good experience .
the food is alright , but service was terrible .
i go to order , and see the kitchen is disgusting .
it 's more expensive than chipotle !
is n't that great .
if i could give a zero , i would .
i spoke to christine h , it director .
_num_ dollars for a prescription of a drug i already knew i needed ?
pure hell !
their er is even worse !
it was so not .
this is not a complaint about the hospital itself our the doctors .
my complaint is the nursing staff .
they are rude .
you can claim all you want to the supervisor but nothing gets done .
it 's sad really .
this hands down has to be the worst hospital i 've ever been to .
decided to check this bakery out this past weekend and was less than impressed .
nope , instead they did n't get the hint .
one friend had a $ _num_ coupon that had expired in june .
by saving $ _num_ they lost the future business from our table .
since the management change , all the attentive and friendly wait staff is gone .
not even close to being worth the time or money .
not impressed at all .
is n't that your job ?
just awful .
bumped up from _num_ star because i did n't get sick from the meal .
boring menu that never changes , uninspired cocktail list and a deplorable beer selection .
the manager had to wait on our table because they were short staffed .
at the time there were only _num_ tables including ours .
i ordered the ahi tuna and it was absolutely horrible .
normally ahi tuna should come out red in the middle while cooked rare .
this came out cold and pink meaning it must of been frozen .
the chairs are n't terribly comfortable and there are no tablecloths .
the cannelloni was good , but nothing special .
it was disappointing .
$ _num_ for dinner for two at a `` neighborhood '' place ?
the chairs are n't terribly comfortable and there are no tablecloths .
the cannelloni was good , but nothing special .
it was disappointing .
$ _num_ for dinner for two at a `` neighborhood '' place ?
it seemed like there was corn syrup in it ( ! )
dessert was vanilla gelato .
the tow man was courteous and helpful .
however this review is not about the tow man but the business .
that was n't the biggest problem .
i could n't believe it .
not these people .
i 'm glad i will never have to speak to her again .
terrible experience .
i would just have to call and they would send somebody down .
_num_ minutes later a truck showed up .
the guy would n't even stop for half a second to hear me out .
he said , `` yeah , just let me turn my truck around . ''
the place smelled like _num_ years of smoking went on in there .
i left feeling like i probably made a mistake coming here .
fast forward two weeks - i just returned from receiving my prepared tax documents .
could not agree with the other reviews more .
do not , not get help at this h & r location .
what a waste of time and money !
also , do n't come if you 're allergic to dogs .
i do n't know , maybe they were doing state inspections or something .
_num_ minutes later i paid and was on my way .
ruined my transmission !
learn from my mistake , take your car to the dealership .
very slow service .
no concern for customers waiting .
otherwise , avoid .
the wrap was very bland but edible ... the home fries were not .
they were burnt to a crisp and had a very strange taste .
it was disgusting .
she tried it and hated it .
my husband got the seafood bisque and did n't like it very much either .
that was not so great .
however , there were several things that made our evening go downhill .
chicken nachos , fried zucchini slices and waffle fries .
this was absolutely ridiculous !
for all the time we had to wait it should have been free !
very disappointing .
our waitress then dropped off the bill before we 'd even received our food .
i wo n't go back .
i was there a month ago and the service was very unfriendly and slow .
the service was incredibly slow .
waited _num_ minutes to get served and another _num_ to get the bill .
i hate to do it , but the bar service has really gone downhill .
they ca n't get any of them right .
she has the absolute worst attitude !
poorly run restaurant ... why _num_ star ?
took nearly _num_ minutes to receive pasta dish .
we sat at the bar and waited _num_ minutes .
there were numerous empty outside tables available .
_num_ tables that were seated after us were waited on .
i spoke with the hostess and informed her of the poor service .
all she did was apologize and said that i am sorry that happened .
do you want to patronize a place like this ?
he left disgusted .
he tells me he knows nothing about my check .
at this point i 'm furious and insist he gets my check .
total scum bag .
do n't waste your time .
cons : dark , dingy interior , poor service and so-so food .
my friends said to expect poor service but good food .
so my friend ate fries for dinner .
another person only ate half of his sandwich .
never will i deal with them again .
the sales person was very helpful , to the point of being pushy .
you ca n't ever make a mattress more firm .
he said give the mattress a few days and the odor would go away .
the company did not care .
terrible quality .
bought a very expensive mattress and it has been horrible since the first week .
worst mattress i have ever slept on .
soooo not going back to the original mattress factory !
the mattress could not be returned unless it was defective .
i can not afford that type of loss .
it is no wonder that the original mattress factory has a no return policy .
my car failed the safety inspection in part due to a scratched windshield .
that 's plain price shopping .
what kind of italian market does n't have fresh basil ?
another _num_ minutes bf the main course !
waiting for an explanation as to what we both saw , i received none .
it took a week to get the dresses back .
but no .
and of course i ended up with a giant black stain on my coat .
was $ _num_ .
i walk in and hand the guy my ticket .
what a ridiculous experience .
dh dropped off some pants for dry cleaning .
for the price this is n't something you can overlook .
second , the process is poorly handled .
she said she 'd call me back in a day or so .
no call from the manager .
third , there is no clear resolution .
the pants were expensive ( for me ) and still pretty new .
i called on thursday and they told me they 'd be done on saturday .
annoying , but nothing i could do .
not this place .
the first time , i asked them to steam a bridesmaid dress for me .
just threw it away .
so clearly it 's the dress 's fault that they ruined it .
i will never , never go back here .
i ca n't believe they 're still in business .
i 'm sure it 's difficult to remember the details of every client complaint .
after two disappointing visits , i have nothing positive to include in my review .
four seasons is not just bad , they are the worst .
the instructions said take them off before wash , can you read english ?
extremely bad attitudes .
no other real effort to help .
_num_ for _num_ , one and done .
very disappointing .
i will not be returning .
it was embarrassing for them and a waste of time for me .
do not use this cleaners !
the area was barely touched .
you 've been warned !
they are not the friendliest , but that never really bothered me .
there is no customer service .
in fact , most employees are down right rude .
avoid if at all possible .
how they get away with it is beyond me .
but the customer service downright sucks !
i am not going to bother checking !
that place is absurd .
very unpleasant and something needs to be done about this .
very ugly cashiers who are not very helpful .
they are missing tons of price tags .
there 's no one to talk to if you have an issue .
horrible !
then the bill was $ _num_ , which is insane .
so , beware of this highly expensive and inept cleaner , and go elsewhere .
the worst customer service ever .
he was literally yelling at me !
acted like i was not a paying customer .
maybe it gets better once you get there .
but no longer .
the service was pretty pathetic too .
that should 've tipped me off in the first place !
so , please do not call this place authentic taiwanese food .
food just is n't good anymore .
authentic - maybe - in not one that would know this .
every time , the place never provided great service .
the owner , who is behind the counter , was not very welcoming .
the portions were quite small , and truly i 'm not amazed .
the bubble tea was not really bubble tea either .
it 's just tea with powdered flavoring , with milk covering the overall taste .
it does not taste like tea .
the place requires $ _num_ or more for use of credit card .
boba tea is average , i 've had much better in california : ( .
their service is terrible , especially when you order take-out .
this place is lame !
needless to say we walked out .
just grossed me out .
unfortunately , there were very few bright spots in our meal .
if you want to try something here , try the short rib with peppers .
however , if you come here be prepared for shitty customer service .
are n't we suppose to stick together or something ?
i would n't recommend their drinks .
they mainly use powder and artificial bs .
the family that owns this place owns several restaurant around the area .
i 've never been a worse restaurant before .
my gf and i went there for dinner last night .
the service in rose tea cafe is horrible .
it seems that they do n't care about their customers at all .
a young waitress looked unhappy that we were n't going to order food .
did n't offer to seat us somewhere else .
was n't happy about that kind of service at all .
service is bad .
_num_ star and not coming back .
totally will not go there again .
the woman and the waiters are so rude .
terrible place .
the owner is a terrible person .
i read that the chunk chicken was awesome , well it was n't .
$ _num_ for a bowl of chicken ?
just no .
last time we went , we were really disappointed .
the meat was overcooked , dry , and chewy .
so gross !
lastly , the people that work there are rude .
tired of their crappy service , and now tired of their rotten food .
the only reason i gave two stars is because of the food .
also the food is a bit too salty , at least in my opinion .
normally i would give this establishment a _num_ or 5-star review .
i 've already done so for their sister shop pink box bakery cafe .
at least put some benches outside if you can not accommodate your customers .
food is nice but service is garbage .
f this place .
i 'm only two miles away .
also the food was very bland and flavorless but the bubble tea was fine .
no , here is what they do .
you walk into the cramped ( otherwise cozy ) restaurant .
when i go up to the counter to order , there are no menus !
wtf , rose tea cafe ?
the prices for the specials and bubble tea is very reasonable too .
not even a smile or acknowledgement as you enter or leave the place !
he is just awful .
sadly , i think its over the hill in its restaurant years .
might not be back .
chicken curry .
worst meal i 've had in squirrel hill in _num_ years .
not curry in any sense .
the lobster and shrimp portion was a confusing stew that tasted like msg .
i 'm exaggerating , but i was n't impressed .
and the vegetable part was this really sad portion of canned corn .
what a huge disappointment it was .
the food was nothing special , to say the least .
i 've been going to this giant eagle since i was a kid .
the employees are totally useless , as is the manager who works nights .
avoid .
and the night crew is n't much better .
first and foremost , their customer service is seriously lacking .
this is consistently the worst giant eagle around .
i have seen lines of 10+ people here at 11:30 at night .
the pharmacy is n't that friendly either .
so now i 'm stuck .
i 'm so confused when i shop here .
if at all possible , use the self check outs .
still , there are problems .
for instance , there are never enough employees working at one time .
fish is not , i repeat , not fresh .
this is right down the street from where i live ...
i agree with the negative reviews .
this place is generally terrible .
the self check out lanes shut down early .
the produce is usually terrible .
i wo n't talk about the food options ( terrible ) .
yesterday , after my long , awkward wait , he did bag my groceries .
i 'm not even asking for joyful cashiers .
totally depressing if looking for anything organic .
they only had _num_ round ones .
aside from the slim , pricey selection , the place was a mess .
there was dried paint all over the table paper and chairs .
books were stuffed under table legs to balance tables .
needless to say , i did n't paint here .
this was not the case .
i find this very inappropriate for a four year old girls birthday party .
i was truly embarrassed .
when i contacted the owner i go no phone call back .
you pay _num_ per person , even if you only but _num_ item .
this is only part of this issue though .
the biggest problem was when we were checking out .
i could have gotten the piece at michaels craft store for $ _num_ .
not great , its an ok pizza shop i guess .
however , what my mom received was completely different .
i will not use them again .
no apologies , no nothing even when i inquired about the price .
what a big mistake .
very unprofessional and rude !
jerry himself seems cranky and is n't very friendly .
also , their listening stations do n't work anymore .
yes -- there are probably a million records in that place ( really ) .
but -- well here 's the problem .
but do n't plan on spending a day here .
you 'll be disappointed .
i do n't see myself coming back .
i absolutely refuse to shop for records here .
the selection is terrible .
not impressed ... especially after hearing all the hype about this place .
there are better places in pgh to buy vinyl for sure .
try the med grill a few blocks down .
meh .
i do not understand the other reviews .
this is some of the worst middle eastern food that i have ever had .
i ordered the chicken salad , which i have had many times before .
the waitresses comment was , `` sorry , there 's a up charge . ''
i will avoid the squirrel hill location in the future .
the atmosphere really can make or break a dining experience .
everything was bad .
also , the beef looked and tasted like rubber ... .
Positive
- the entire restaurant was empty .
worst .
bad business practice .
no one offered to help me in my search .
horrible service and food .
do you like waiting _num_ minutes for fast food ?
the place sucks .
i am sorry to say wo n't visiting this dump again !
the tables are so sticky , i felt like i 'd catch a disease .
the service is so slow .
2pm on a thursday could not even be bothered to answer back a hello .
they also would have made a better sale .
the selection is small and the prices are too high .
what the hell ?
we have had our car inspected there in the past with no problems .
we could n't afford it since we were already putting on new snow tires .
obviously they do n't believe in writing anything down .
and timing is entirely random .
however , that was n't the big issue .
i 've never been treated as poorly as this by any car mechanic .
update ... apparently jr has standards .
which makes it ok , i guess .
i wo n't go there again .
i got a pizza from here and it was downright awful .
it was very dry and there was little to no sauce .
the cheese almost tasted old as well .
i was excited to get pizza here .
this pizza did not meet my expectations .
i decide to go pick it up anyways .
i was told _num_ minutes and picked it up on time .
the pizza was already ready when i arrive , and it was cold !
the box was not even warm .
this pizza was under cooked and the toppings looked disgusting .
some of the pieces barely had any toppings at all .
this experience was very disappointing , and i will not return .
it was actually my husband who called and left a message , not me .
and offended !
worst chinese food ever .
i totally got sick after eating their take-out .
still , this is the worst chinese restaurant i 've ever been to .
overly greasy chinese take out .
i also added on an egg roll and a _num_ oz dr pepper .
ugh this just was n't a good experience at all !
this restaurant totally sucks .
it did n't make sense at all .
estimated delivery time was _num_ minutes , which is average for most places .
we also found the flavoring to be mediocre compared to others we 've tried .
we will not be ordering from them again .
the food was way too salty .
the spice was ok , i did n't think it was flavorful .
i felt sick after eating here .
bad food and bad service .
i left feeling somewhat ripped off and disrespected .
i can cook much better szechuan dish at home .
disappointed ... .
it was way too thick and upset my stomach .
i then ordered the dumplings .
my `` waitress '' asked me if i wanted pork or veggie .
a long wait later she brought out pork dumplings .
the service was terrible .
we complained and got nowhere .
first off : they screwed up our order .
they also did n't even apologize for the error .
to me this is really just poor service .
everything we got that was supposed to be hot and spicy was mild .
i do n't think i 'll order from here again which is a shame .
we were so excited about trying chinese food for the first time in pittsburgh .
tasteless and boring .
not worth it .
however , my last _num_ take-out orders from them have fallen flat .
there were bones in the sesame chicken takeout .
moo goo gai pan was salty and all of the vegetables overcooked .
disgusting .
no seasoning .
my husband just picked up $ _num_ of take out .
salt apparently is unheard of .
and how the heck do you mess up fried rice ?
my hot and sour soup was tasteless and vinegary .
$ _num_ for steamed veggies in soy sauce ?
also could someone bring me dinner as this was inedible .
disgusting .
no seasoning .

definitely do not recommend .
one of the worst chinese places i 've eaten at by far .
so needless to say i 've had better .
i have been disappointed with delivery food lately .
only bright side , chinese food delivery was fast .
and each time it has gotten worse !
avoid this place !
the first time , i got fries and a buffalo chicken wrap .
the buffalo chicken sauce is n't even buffalo chicken sauce .
it 's this strange hot sauce that looks like a vinaigrette .
not only that , but the fries were super soggy and gross .
, but nothing too special to write home about .
the steak hoagie was also a huge disappointment .
i like to get wings with _num_ sauces mixed together .
the first time i ordered a sauce mixture , it was n't an issue .
this led me to wonder if they washed their bowls between customers or not .
bad : everything else .
the pizza tasted like a frozen pizza heated til it was hard and crispy .
i love supporting local businesses but this pizza place will not be visited again .
i 'd rather go to pizza hut ( gross ) than here .
not worth the money .
place business !
pizza tastes like cardboard .
chicken gyro was dried chicken breast with no flavor .
but i guess enough people do like their food .
tonight i returned to the familiar cozy little dining room once more .
Negative
unfortunately , the negative aspects also are as i remembered .
instead , they looked a bit dried out and tasted bland .
overall , i was disappointed .
also , the tempura udon was a rip-off at $ _num_ a la carte .
ridiculous .
the fried chicken that comes with the meal is decent , but nothing special .
worst of all - the toro was a bit tough .
to my understanding toro should never be tough .
i 'm hoping i just caught them on an off night .
the atmosphere is awful , it feels like a cheap dining room .
but why should n't a sushi place have fresh fish ?
really not that great .
we were there on a saturday night , and it was quite busy .
definitely not up to the rave reviews they 're getting from most yelpers .
also , it was n't a `` cheap '' place .
it is unacceptable .
however , the only good thing i liked at this restaurant is their wasabi !
is it just impossible to find fresh sashimi in pittsburgh ?
weird , weird place .
i 've never been somewhere that made you feel so uncomfortable as a patron .
really weird place .
it was also really expensive for the portion we received .
why does fried chicken accompany every meal ?
disappointed .
it felt a little rushed but we appreciated the customer service .
service slow .
i mean , come on !
was i just eating bargain bin sushi at designer prices ?
probably never will .
unfortunately , i wo n't be returning .
but the fried chicken was tasteless , sushi was ordinary at best .
the salmon smells weird .
service is terrible .
they can keep there stupid fancy sushi rolls and udon soup .
over all , it was a bad dinner experience .
i was very disappointed at the first sight of the beef udon .
worst japanese food we have ever eaten in our life .
we ordered chicken , beef and salmon teriyaki .
sashimi just so so , we had salmon and uni sashimi .
i did n't start to eat it .
i do n't know how others think this place is good .
poor quality .
sushi was dry .
rice was dry .
the chicken pieces served are disgusting , small chewy chicken pieces .
nothing special but good by pittsburgh standards .
the service is very slow .
i was a bit underwhelmed by this sushi experience , especially for the price .
that came out to $ _num_ for two people .
i 've tried a number of times and the product is only passable .
big mistake .
it would be tolerable if the product were special but it just is n't .
i got ta say - i just do n't get it .
the total was $ _num_ before tip with just water to drink .
the soup had a weird aftertaste that i just could n't place .
again , nothing really to rave about .
my roll combo also suffered from a strange temperature issue .
the food came out really slow , too .
one point off .
maybe that 's the norm in pittsburgh , i do n't know .
i do n't get the hype , this is not good sushi .
and the pieces were mush , like they were left over cuts .
unfortunately she proceeded to over cook the belly .
that was actually a theme of the dishes we had : crap sushi rice .
i mean , seriously , whole foods makes better sushi rice than this place .
tastier rolls too .
ick .
we left extremely disappointed .
also , there is no need to be rude .
the customer service could use a little work though .
i really ca n't get too excited about the bagels here .
but really , there is n't much to get overly excited about .
she makes you feel like you are ordering your bagel at the prison cafeteria .
why is it so hard ?
the last two times they 've provided a dreadful experience .
i wrote it off as a fluke .
i 've been here twice , once for dinner and once for dim sum .
dim sum is overly greasy .
no carts with women yelling at you in cantonese .
we also did n't see any chopsticks .
the meat was heavy , dry , stringy , and salty .
the meat was flavorless and dry .
they were not , as the restaurant said , spicy at all .
everything is extremely greasy and chewy and i would not go again .
szechuan dumplings in hot sesame sauce : what ?
we probably wo n't be back .
worst dumplings i 've had in my life .
)
, red bean buns and on and on .
the place for a saturday lunch service was n't all that busy .
and again , it was a huge disappointment all around .
the price was right but we wo n't be returning .
.
came here for dim sum and was not happy .
then i ate all the fortune cookies for our table .
i am so disappointed and disgusted with them .
sushi delivery is why this place did n't get _num_ star .
with so many other choices in squirrel hill , why go here ?
but the food is very ... plain .
skip it unless you must have sushi now !
sat looked at the menu kinda wondered to go elsewhere but stayed instead .
just three type of dumplings only three !
my opinion just skip this place much better chinese food in sq hill .
this place is horrible !
ginger duck was gross and other dishes were bland .
they have seriously gone downhill .
they seem to have started just adding sugar and grease to their food .
it was okay sashimi but clearly not very fresh .
the food is n't that great .
very disappointing .
also the only time i have never finished sushi .
i was very disappointed with their customer service skills .
i ordered by phone the man i talked was very rude .
it was disgusting !
gross .
it 's not that hard .
they do n't clean up much .
if bagels are your thing , you 'll like this place .
not worth going back for though .
i would never patronize this place after meeting this man .
very not inside with an odd odor .
they did n't even know the ages of my children .
`` awful '' is n't a big enough word to describe the incident .
so , no more daycare !
many people did n't get their money back .
i went there today for a late breakfast with my family .
that 's no big deal .
my gut just tells me not to trust e 'n ps .
so i wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff .
hill e 'n p is a dive diner chain for sure .
this location is hipster central on the weekends after the bars let out .
i 'm used to real jersey diners .
this diner , in comparison , is kinda the equivalent to friendly 's .
they spent money on new art that shows the neighborhood .
if i recall correctly , the amount was around $ _num_ million .
they have enough money to donate $ _num_ million to charity .
a big fancy renovation - with the same ol ' crappy food .
the same flavorless sausage gravy for dried out biscuits .
same ol ' canned fruit .
service has always been friendly , if slow .
_num_ stars , only because i think the smiley cookies are cute .
the food tasted dismal , and the portions were small .
wow ... unbelievably disappointed .
appalling .
worst case , their carryout line is usually pretty short and speedy .
usually i just get a burger and a baked potato .
even while trying to get someone 's attention i was ignored .
still hoping to hear back but not getting my hopes up .
half the time , there were no clean plates to use .
nonetheless , $ _num_ for an all-you-can-eat breakfast is still a very good deal .
you surely does not sound like rachel '' .
because i have an accent my name can not be rachel ?
this place just did n't impress me .
the service was just terrible .
this guy is out of business .
not sure why still shows up on yelp places .
they might be fine for dry cleaning , but no good for tailoring clothing .
another mediocre sushi experience .
the only good thing about this place is the strawberry hotcakes .
maybe i 'm just spoiled but this place is sub par .
the restaurant was small , cash only .
the food was typical diner breakfast food .
i was n't blown away by anything special .
now , mineo 's ... better pizza .
then there was the bland cheese and watered down sauce .
i was so disappointed in aiello 's .
ugh .
the pizza tasted like junk .
i could n't even finish it .
that being said , i doubt i will be going back there very soon .
their pizza is not awesome .
the service was terrible .
this was i think a _num_ slice pizza .
i am not my mother .
the wedding soup arrived rather hot ( microwaved ) and in a styrofoam container .
i ate the entire piece but was not pleased .
what i tasted made me stop eating .
i do n't know how people can eat this much italian spice .
the employees not so much .
i called twice tonight and was hung up on both times .
but do n't sell beer .
$ _num_ for a medium , cheese , onion , and mushroom pizza .
flavor is not included with the cost of the pizza .
$ _num_ for one pizza and some breadsticks .
nothing to write home about at all !
did i mention they use canned mushrooms ?
disappointed now !
sugary tomato sauce , cheese is like aged american cheese .
wow , _num_ stars ?
they were rude .
however , yelp have it _num_ stars .
so we made that brutal mistake of trusting yelp .
i lost a little faith in this city by how celebrated this place is .
cheese blend is highly questionable , mine was rubbery really .
ps : the spot is cash only , which is also annoying .
the ambiance in this place is n't bad and neither is the food .
but that 's the problem .
if you want amazing thai food maybe go to bloomfield instead .
( i am not ashamed .
the crab rangoon was obviously frozen .
it was cold inside .
i was trying to be healthy by getting my vegetables in .
i chose the wrong thing , clearly .
i was not happy .
instead , it was mostly just cream cheese .
would it be that hard to mix up an original dipping sauce ?
as far as thai goes - this is just your average thai place .
we traveled _num_ minutes to get thai food and will never go again .
bad customer service .
there you have it $ 20+ wasted on garbage .
if you are looking for thai food i strongly recommend the green mango instead .
the worst thai food i 've had in pittsburgh .
the service was slow , but expected for a friday night .
restaurant is noisy when crowded .
the food was a big disappointment .
we had the fish in ginger sauce and mixed seafood with basil leaves .
ordered chicken pad thai and the thai wonton soup .
for the price , was disappointed .
basically , this place is terrible .
i ate here last night .
however , i was sorely disappointed .
secondly , the quality of the food was laughable .
my boyfriend and i went last friday night .
however , the food was sub-par and expensive !
terrible .
_num_ .
coconut soup was too salty to be edible .
_num_ .
_num_ .
curry was watery and thin , with barely a cup of vegetables per entree .
for $ _num_ an entree , this was totally unacceptable .
_num_ .
take note , y'all , this is the definition of lazy cooking .
conclusion : avoid avoid avoid .
seating was not a problem .
the meal was just ok.
the appetizers were disappointing .
the beer selection and prices were fine .
to me it did n't look that appealing or exotic .
the bill pretty much topped it off .
if you are vegan , have allergies , etc .
the food was nothing special .
_num_ for the food .
my dinner partner ordered the chicken satay ( $ _num_ ) for five .
he said it was ok but had better elsewhere .
maybe they are trying to keep their electric bill low .
total bill $ _num_ for two !
rude service !
the food was decent , but the service was terrible .
skip this place .
i have been to several different locations ( bloomfield , sq .
i am also not really a fan of this chain of salons .
yeah ... i was not sold on her services - at all !
are you kidding me ?
if it 's bad , then run .
if i go to get a haircut , i want a haircut .
this salon is mediocre .
in terms of stylists , avoid amy if you can .
i did n't realize that it was amy again until i got there .
a little too expensive .
bad haircut .
if going here for a men 's haircut , avoid renee .
if i could rate `` _num_ '' stars , i would .
almost the worst cut i 've ever had .
against my better judgement , i went back to have the issue corrected .
this is the worst cut ever .
this salon claims that they consider hair texture and face shape when performing cuts .
thanks for a horrible cut !
i scheduled and had a pedicure here april _num_ .
this is not really the best place to get a pedicure .
the cut was n't great , but it was n't terrible .
i probably wo n't be back .
it was a rush job , and an insult at $ _num_ without tip .
whole experience was lackluster .
bacon was hard , dry , and tasteless .
only plus is that the burger was clearly handmade and not some frozen patty .
we were really disappointed with our food here .
and dry , not nearly juicy enough .
it 's probably worse than it sounds .
grill is n't someplace that i 'd suggest to return to because honestly ?
i would n't remember it even existed .
seriously , yelpers , how does this place have such a high rating ?
i 'm hardly sad about that .
just ok , could have more flavor .
i , instead , went for the french onion soup and cesar salad .
presentation was off and it just came out looking sad and wilted .
horrible time .
she even took the beer i was drinking and told me to leave .
i will never visit this place again .
save your time and your money and skip this place .
the fish tacos i ordered once were overcooked and lacking in flavor too .
the cole slaw that accompanied my last dinner was comparable to kfc 's .
we were really disappointed with this restaurant .
it had a `` dirty '' smell upon entering and the food was terrible .
everything is just very stale tasting .
zero stars .
i am not kidding - _num_ very small potatoes .
should 've gone to outback .
same prices , but better quality .
i wo n't be back .
cheeseburger sliders : way over done .
salmon burger : all bread crumbs .
you let me down , yelp .
wo n't be getting pizza from here again .
reminded me of bad high school cafeteria pizza .
i love plain cheese pizza .
i live _num_ miles from the establishments .
not a great way to run a customer service oriented business .
i just do n't get what people like about this place .
we all agreed , and we did n't even finish the pizza .
ummm , gross !
i mean , the pizza is edible , but not worth the calories .
boring , nasty , would n't go there again .
i do n't see what the big deal is .
not really any bright spots here .
i do n't see the attraction .
for pizza , its not cheap .
the pizza does n't taste all that good and is greasy at best .
the place has not been renovated since the _num_ 's and it shows .
cheese was pure solid , too salty , and half an inch thick .
_num_ ) there is such thing as too much cheese .
this should not happen .
a lot of the restaurants in squirrel hill seem to have this problem .
it was super greasy and had way too much cheese !
i lived in brooklyn for a few years , i know pizza !
this was horrible !
mineo 's is terrible .
this pizza is not any particular style , i.e .
ny , pan , chicago , etc .
the multiple times i 've been here , the pizza has been somewhat inconsistent .
way too greasy for my taste .
the cheese they use is n't so tasty either .
that 's no way to eat a pizza !
however , this is not up to par for their reputation .
just too much cheese .
just not good pizza .
kind of weird , but at least it was n't my fault !
the pizza was tasty , but very messy .
but i have to say - grossly overpriced for what you get .
but seriously - it 's just ridiculous .
a large plain cheese pizza was $ _num_ .
the boyfriend dropped me off and i ran in to get the pizza .
wooden walls .
the employees were friendly and i was in and out in no time .
upon tasting though , i could n't believe it ; so salty .
the pepperoni was n't cooked well , and the sauce was less than expected .
at $ _num_ , rip off indeed .
and parking is a disaster !
_num_ pepperoni and _num_ sausage and mushroom .
as for the sausage and mushroom , what a mess .
the sausage was hands down disgusting .
the mushrooms were slimy and gross straight out of a can .
my biggest complaints lie in the sauce and construction .
the sauce was bland and flavorless .
also both pizzas were impossible to eat .
if you have to use a fork , someone screwed up .
oh how the mighty have fallen .
pizza is nothing special .
canned mushrooms , spinach , and shrimp .
sauce and cheese ordinary .
worst pizza i 've ever had !
so soggy and too much sauce .
i hate it when the crust is soggy !
the sauce tasted sour and the crust like cardboard .
not too much but more than i wanted .
i have to admit that i was n't too thrilled about the flavor .
it literally just tasted like melted cheese on bread .
sorry mineo 's : i just was n't impressed .
after all the hype about this joint i decided to check it out .
this place did n't impress me one bit .
not sure i get the hype .
went to the new bar/restaurant area last thursday and had a terrible experience .
overall not a good experience and do n't recommend the pizza either .
gross pizza .
way too hot .
poor service .
dirty dining room .
it 's sad .
the pizza was good but was not thrilled with the service .
the pizza looked average and taste was not that great at all !
the worst part is that the place is cash only !
but this new bread of employees is for the bird .
are you serious like the customer was not yelling or causing a scene .
that was so wrong what a horrible way to treat a woman .
after all that waiting , the pizza was undercooked and just horrible !
bad decision !
still do n't get it .
not picked up .
i got there at _num_ and was told they stop serving at _num_ .
mostly , they seem to have been cutting too many corners .
it was the biggest waste of time ever .
)
do n't waste your time like me .
as i barely wear glasses ever , i declined .
just do n't expect a relaxed and thorough exam .
he might be busy but lacking basic courtesy is not cool .
never again would i use her or the branch which represents her .
i needed _num_ shirts done in _num_ hours .
it 's not that crazy !
i got over it until button number five was smashed .
now to the pants , do not take pants there .
horrible !
Neutral
negative _num_ stars .
i said that i would prefer to have them dry cleaned but she refused .
i brought _num_ shirts there which are now all ruined .
it is without question the worst dry cleaner i have ever been to .
i was appalled by the condition of this store and the animals being sold .
the stench was unbearable .
the owner was extremely rude to us .
this guy is awful .
you just walked by and dont care for animals , huh ? ''
not a fan .
the service is so slow .
it struck me as a diner with a bar in it .
beer selection in bottles was good but the draft selection was limited .
the squirrel cafe seemed like a little mom and pop place .
i wanted to give this place a better review .
this place makes me want to order in and drink at home .
first i was just ignored .
no glasses . ''
i 'm _num_ years old .
i 'm sorry , what ?
it 's your job to serve drinks to complete strangers .
at this point , i 'd had enough .
i 'm not spending my money in a place that treats people like shit .
this was my first and last visit to this place .
what an absolute disgrace .
worst place ever .
the waitress is rude , as well as the guy near the bar .
unhappy memory .
shame on you , mario !
she never said a thing and asked me to schedule a cleaning .
they do n't care about their patients , only their wallet .
sat for _num_ hours and didnt even get my teeth cleaned .
was then told couldnt get a follow up for _num_ months .
do not go here to get your eyebrows waxed whatsoever .
unfortunately i do not get my nails done .
the quality of the food itself was extremely disappointing .
this is n't worthy of a second chance .
it 's like tiramisu in beer form , people .
but unfortunately for mr. ( or ms. ? )
i ordered the turkey and pesto sandwich .
which was small , expensive , and completely underwhelming .
matzo ball soup quite good , by that 's hard to mess up .
tonight 's soup was quite tasteless .
their quality of service is not near what it used to be .
dr h advised me to wait for another _num_ weeks or a month .
my gyro platter was just okay .
do n't think i will be back .
overall , a bad experience and we recommend avoiding this place .
atmosphere not what i would consider very clean .
service was terrible .
then never came back to collect payment .
just left money on the table and plan on never returning .
my husband was very disabled and unable to write or speak .
and cheated me .
this is false .
it was just dead in there .
what the hell ?
just tell me what is going on .
nope .
i 'm actually glad i got out of there without spending any money .
if you do n't have a laptop , then you will feel really awkward .
the coffee is mediocre .
the barista , however , was incredibly rude .
i ignored it and ordered an almond mocha .
it only takes one person to really mess up the whole experience .
and btw , your cookies are awful , too .
_num_ .
_num_ .
my chai latte , which was neither hot nor very tasty .
and i did not get one .
hello , _num_ .
quite disappointing .
had a god awful chai latte .
there are very few things that bother me with food establishments .
and they were very rude when i complained about the quality ... no respect !
not cool !
wrong .
the blueberry scone i purchased had no flavor at all .
it was extremely bland , as if a major ingredient was missing ... sugar ?
so i have never reviewed a place in my life .
an hour later after an hour wait i am good to go .
from the outside , it seems like a nice enough shop .
the staff did not come across as particularly friendly or helpful .
still , my overall experience was not entirely satisfactory .
_num_ stars .
i might come back again , but i might not .
the owner owed me money and has still not paid me .
big mistake !
horrible service .
check out another location instead of this one .
uncle sam 's has really gone down hill .
the staff has gone from polite , to indifferent , to borderline hostile .
sometimes the italian tastes overcooked or old , like bad prosciutto .
the steak is gray and bland .
atmosphere at sam 's is as thin as the service .
rude rude people at counter .
brian is very rude and the young girls are rude too .
very expensive and just okay subs .
if you do take out , you do n't get fries .
rude and not worth it !
price was alright .
workers are extremely rude !
need better customer service skills .
they smelled and tasted nasty .
on top of all that , the restaurant was dirty .
never tell a former philly girl that whiz on a cheese steak is disgusting !
i wo n't be back .
i am trying to post this with no stars .
lost some weight .
took _num_ pair of nice shorts to be taken in .
fell apart within a week .
fell apart again .
however , his prices are inconsistent .
this gym is terrible .
i do n't normally write reviews .
the equipment is nice , the staff are not knowledgeable though .
_num_ months later i noticed my credit card was still being automatically billed .
much better and more reasonably priced facilities not far away .
the showers in the `` family changing area '' are disgusting beyond belief .
sometimes there is zero parking available .
clean , better hours , and only _num_ per month .
for tea , late-night hunger cravings , dinner , lunch , dessert .
huge portions , but i would n't say spectacular .
here , i normally stick with what i consider safe options - club sandwiches .
the cheesecake with strawberries is typical and satisfied my sweet tooth at least .
quite possibly the most overrated restaurant i ever went to in pittsburgh .
the restaurant itself is ok for the food , but nothing special .
our experience was just plain bad .
we disliked our main meal so much we did n't even bother ordering deserts .
the place was messy and just had a really poor atmosphere .
what really made matters worse was the waiter .
personally i do n't see what the be deal about this place is .
Positive
the negative ?
this place was terrible .
nasty .
portions are plentiful , the atmosphere is comfortable , and the food is average .
i have never met anyone who cared less about his job than our server .
the food was greasy and unremarkable .
no human should eat that much food in one sitting .
with that said , the desserts we had were pretty tasty .
as for the decor , they need a facelift badly .
the service was great , i did n't have a problem with it .
low quality food !
it tasted really weird and i had to send it back .
2x 's ago the food seemed to be heated up and not fresh made .
we gave the place another chance and it was worse .
not really cake at all .
just wondering if this place is on the decline .
if you ca n't do it right , then it 's time to close .
the total was $ _num_ before tip , which seems a bit pricey .
the food was just mediocre .
the cheese wontons were okay but the cheese tasted just a bit off .
the tofu homestyle was bland and the sauce had an odd aftertaste .
and now that it 's winter , it 's extremely cold inside .
worse chinese ive ever had and the owner is miserable .
the veggies were cold and the tofu had never touched a pan .
it had not even been seasoned .
it was just soy mush .
all of them said it was wrong , gross , cold , horrible .
she was mean , and rude .
nothing has been free .
because i had already picked what i wanted , but it was horrible .
i will never go back and i always tell my friends to avoid it .
as you can see from my reviews i never rate things badly .
i am not going to put anyone out of business .
i hate it .
`` what kind of ring would n't have a stamp ? ''
so do n't go here unless you are equally snooty about jewelry .
but even so , it spoiled the evening .
the tacos were cold and the dude was sketchy .
i could hardly believe how little meat i had .
also , housekeeping is lacking .
the garbage spilled out all over the floor .
spoke to the head nurse several times and nothing has been done .
this is your typical average chinese restaurant .
but the subway next door would be better .
i will never spend another dime at this establishment .
when they say spicy , they mean spicy .
i give _num_ star because the wonton soup was fairly decent .
the rest of my lunch combination meal was dreadful .
actually the small portion of soup deserves 1/2 star .
_num_ wonton soup was forgotten , but they did deliver a replacement asap .
my szechuan shrimp and beef was very bland .
no flavor whatsoever .
but the worst part was i found a hair in it .
it was very unappetizing seeing it in there .
now the worst part .
the rice sucked , btw .
very bland .
no veggies .
i was still hungry afterwards .
needless to say , i wo n't be back .
this place gets _num_ star from me .
only thing that was ok was the egg roll .
she returned hers as well .
never returning terrible experience , terrible attitude about their own product .
wonton soup tastes gross like they never change the soup in the pot .
there 's nothing inside the wonton .
worst wonton i have ever eaten .
the info screen says they deliver but they do n't .
the chicken lo mein was ok but overall lacked flavor .
i called once and gave my address and they confirmed they would deliver .
not nice people and zero customer service !
my party of four had a disappointing dinner experience .
beyond that , the food was not good .
the moo shu vegetable could not have been more lackluster .
if you have any problems with msg , do n't even consider this place .
the szechuan chicken was pretty mediocre .
i was sooooo disappointed !
i do n't even know where to start .
anyway ... .
that answer confused the folks asking , so they passed .
greasy over cooked shrimp !
i 'm over giving this place big praise .
i wo n't be going back .
not true anymore !
we chose the room by the river where we faced the steel bridge .
no lemon on the plates .
the food was as bland as could be !
appetizer : rare tuna which was sliced too thin .
quality of tuna was ok .
$ _num_ the crab meat `` was '' lump .
fish was cooked correctly , done but very moist .
lump crab was highlight of dish .
would never return even if it was for free .
i 've had brunch here twice and both times i 've been underwhelmed .
to top it off , the service was terrible .
there might be a lot of it , but it 's not the great .
it tastes like a buffet to me .
not as fresh or as flavorful as i would like .
also , i like a little mimosa with my brunch .
most of the cooked foods were too greasy and overcooked .
it 's time to take charge and get the food up to par .
other than that , we have nothing much good to say about grand concourse .
this place is very much over rated & over priced in our opinion .
wife 's $ _num_ shrimp appetizer consisted of _num_ small shrimp .
both wife & i had cowboy steak entree with mashed potatoes .
go elsewhere to eat !
the food ranged from bad to just ok .
normally when the reviews are this mixed i stay far away .
it just is n't done this way .
neither of which this place makes on their own .
the desert station is n't worth my time to talk about .
another sad and depressing effort here in the burgh .
too bad that such a pretty restaurant should offer such mediocre food .
it was edible but nothing to recommend .
this was probably the best thing i ate .
we went here for thanksgiving and our experience was _num_ stars .
however , easter was a whole new game .
that was just not cool .
maybe my expectations were high after our thanksgiving experience , but i was disappointed .
the first wait staff arrived with water a few minutes after 8pm .
the service was friendly and pleasant , but very slow .
however , that is were the excitement over the food ended .
two people in our party ordered fish ( one tilapia and one sole ) .
both were average at best , with heavy breading and little flavor .
fish was good , potatoes were old .
they were brown and dry .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it was barely edible .
the fish was cooked dry and was not hot .
_num_ .
the member of our party who ordered an irish coffee was forgotten .
_num_ .
there in lies the problem with this place .
also , due to the circumstances of that , i did not pay .
reservations were for _num_ .
just keep them next time , i think that would have come off better .
strike _num_ .
not comfortable for me .
strike _num_ .
i will only be dining at their sunday brunch from now on .
wrong !
it was overcrowded ; we had reservations and still had to wait _num_ minutes .
as i said , never again .
ca n't beat that donut machine for brunch though !
drinks were never refilled after the initial serving .
needless to say , we will not be back .
going in with high expectations , we left very underwhelmed .
our visit , however , did n't meet our expectations .
the entire concourse was closed off for a wedding reception .
the coconut shrimp with mango salsa were excellent .
only _num_ pieces of asparagus were on the plate .
- drinks : overpriced and underwhelming at $ _num_ a piece .
in the end , it does n't look like we will be back .
our waitress never told us why just handed us menus and walked away .
never introduced himself just asked were we ready to order .
grand concourse can never get my service !
i wish i was joking .
our salads arrived and chris and i both finished our drinks before our salads .
we sat with empty glasses and cleaned plates for a long time .
all in all our dinner of three courses took an hour and _num_ minutes .
i would n't return here unfortunately .
but i expect nothing more .
this restaurant is completely empty for lunch on every day other than sunday .
the fish itself tasted old .
a friend ordered a dish with rice that was soggy .
okay it is the holidays so we overlooked it .
also the portions were small and we 're not big eaters .
... very poor food and service - save your money .
horrible service for brunch !
my suggestion , go elsewhere .
this restaurant came highly recommended but we were treated horribly !
our waiter never introduced himself ... just plain out rude !
left message on yelp hoping i can stop people from experiencing what i did .
horrible customer service for such a nice look restaurant .
first mistake , they brought us both ny strip steaks .
this steak was so over seasoned and salty i could n't even eat it .
the ny strip was also over cooked but no seasoning at all .
we gave it another shot but sadly disappointing again !
unfortunately , the second time around was not very good .
it was so disappointing !
they really need to fix the setup they have for brunch .
everything on the hot bar was cold , eggs , sausage , etc .
the dessert could n't even save it .
long long wait for food .
some food was cold .
one order was wrong .
they were n't ready for us or the people around us .
do n't go here at an odd time .
so bland , very oily and horrible taste .
would not come here again for dinner !
maybe it was a bad night , but this was not a good experience .
the shrimp scampi were soft and `` mushy '' .
is grand concourse on a downhill slide ?
the main dining room used to be an omg experience when entering .
not anymore .
i was very disappointed this evening with the service and the food .
greg stated that he did n't know he had a table .
the crab cake was dry .
food : sunday brunch was not as good as i remembered it .
the bagel was over toasted and hard as a rock .
eggs were runny , and potatoes were mushy .
the lox was not fresh and the fruit salad tasted days old .
i was extremely disappointed in the food .
first off , my lettuce was soggy .
i was starving but i really should have sent it back .
total rip-off .
the salad was iceberg lettuce and a very lackluster dressing .
i was not offered a choice of dressings .
brunch is served on sunday , in the main dining room until _num_ .
the ladies room could have used some attention .
i would n't hurry back .
a couple of cheap seats at a pirates game .
my mother 's side of potatoes was ice cold .
really not good .
caesar salad a little better , romaine was green .
but even those did not save this rather bad meal .
what a waste of such a beautiful facility .
i 'm not sure why i have n't reviewed this before .
it 's gone way downhill !
not much by way of vegetarian or vegan options .
unfortunately they were cold !
okay , back to the review , is it hard to mark the offerings ?
it 's just not a well laid out buffet .
the food is not worth the _num_ .
first rule of fish - you do n't have cheese with fish .
but overall , the quality now does not reflect the hefty price .
the buffet is spread out in about _num_ different areas which are not visible .
nothing is labeled which is really horrible when it 's so dark inside .
you ca n't tell what is whipped cream , cream cheese , or butter .
everything on the buffet was cold .
cold eggs , cold potatoes , cold bacon , cold sauted veggies .
i went for the brunch buffett with my wife on sunday .
he never apologized and the woman that sat us was in a mood too .
oh , the food , that would be good to mention too .
to make a long story short , the it was not worth the price .
felt like the staff was hired from mcdonalds .
finally , the service was bad too .
it was really busy on easter sunday .
no apologies , just a smile .
what a disappointing experience for such a high caliber restaurant .
i am sorry .
i 've stayed here before and not had issues .
the bathroom was all shower with a drain in the floor .
not sure .
called security multiple times , they did nothing .
the service in the restaurant at breakfast was beyond awful .
chairs in the dining room have obviously never been cleaned .
good location , but the hotel itself leaves much to be desired .
for the price , it was a big disappointment !
also - this hotel is loud !
this would have been helpful to know when i checked in .
they were selling a tiny bottle of it for $ _num_ which is ridiculous .
stained carpets , stuff sitting out in the hallways .
market doors , peeling paint , you can smell dust and mold .
ridiculous .
wifi was horrible as well .
there is not one good thing about this hotel .
outdated rooms , funny smelling lobby , front desk staff less than accommodating .
for a sheraton this is not the greatest .
the people who clean can see it , why do n't they remove it .
many complaints we heard in the hotel , noise level is one .
loud ... people walking through the hallways are rude and loud after hours !
there were bugs in the bathroom and a strong smell of dust and mold .
not impressed ... .
_num_ . )
gross .

they do have a fitness center , pool , and a sauna .
they even have $ _num_ movies to rent !
-the lobby , fitness center and pool were really nice .
Negative
it 's nearly impossible to go anywhere without having to pay to park .
so there was another expense before i even got to my room !
-the walls are paper thin .
i 've seen better quality at less reputable brands .
they were not even nice about it .
do n't stay here if you need transportation .
friends stayed at the westin and had no problems .
too bad nothing has changed since .
for what i 'm paying i would have expected something better than motel _num_ .
not worth it for the location .
the staff is friendly , it 's all downhill from there .
no outlets available to charge anything .
customer service is huge with me so that 's a big downfall !
there were about _num_ guests there and the place was packed .
very disappointed in this hotel .
very disappointing .
Negative
free breakfast , consistent , clean rooms at reasonable prices .
it is a shame this place was not better .
no big deal though .
wish i had n't bothered !
in fact stay elsewhere !
we spent our wedding night hotel hopping just to find a room !
at this point , i decided i should probably check the bed .
i travel often & will not be booking with sheraton after this experience .
the whole bed smelled like it had never been cleaned before .
do n't stay here if you are paying a regular rate .
poor service .
it took over _num_ minutes to check in .
like i said , none of it was huge on its own .
but the combination was just awful .
inept staff and poor service .
will not stay here again .
this place stinks ... literally .
why they keep coming back i do n't know .
poor customer service .
they even messed up my email address so i got no confirmation .
do n't waste your hard earned money or time .
again , poor , poor customer service .
in _num_ degree weather .
however they have awful customer service and disrespectful employees .
i ate breakfast and the food was horrible .
this check in procedure took _num_ minutes before we had our keys .
instead of a king bed , it had a full size bed .
no big deal as i did n't expect my room to be ready .
i learned long ago that all of them stock the same cheap toilet paper .
the room also smelled like smoke .
horrible service .
no turnover of tables .
certainly never will get my business being this disrespectful to customers & questionable honesty .
maybe instant watered down grits .
this place is disgusting on so many levels .
first of all the music sucks .
convenience is the only plus .
quality and consistency are lacking .
not a good idea .
otherwise you could be getting something that you really do n't like .
they got the date wrong on when the arrangement was to be delivered .
they did n't call so i could go anywhere else .
they were n't sorry , and we were stuck .
there are not any fully yellow roses or red mini roses what so ever .
i ordered flowers for my boyfriends mom for mother 's day ... never arrived .
oops i guess they missed it !
offered to send it on wednesday ... no !
my complaints are simple , and i think they 're reasonable .
i never complain , but this was a terrible experience all around .
unfortunately , that meant filling in with lots of green leaves .
first , the flowers that were delivered were nothing like i had ordered .
the arrangement was so small it was pathetic .
i would definitely recommend going elsewhere for flower arrangements .
wonton soup had undercooked noodles .
cream cheese puffs were just bad !
pork fried rice was lightly brown in color and did n't have much flavor .
the pork ribs were ok and the happy family main dish was a ripoff .
there were no scallops or lobster meat .
there were a few giant shrimp and much sliced pork .
the beef and chicken were of very poor quality .
the sauce was very bland .
unfortunately there was only _num_ prior review on yelp .
it is just ok .
deplorable service , food takes an average of _num_ hours to deliver .
_num_ hours !
they never gave us any cheese wontons .
the shrimp were hard and tasted old .
the ribs were not edible .
my son said they were the worst he ever had .
the other two and a half out of three got left in the bag .
the pizza here is way undercooked .
the sauce was pretty generic and tasted like cheap stuff from a jar .
this places seems to be way off with their delivery times .
i hate to give bad rating but it was really bad .
she said the delivery time was _num_ mins .
not cooked .
dump ass me ate some anyway .
not good !
spinach and mushroom white pizza had uneven dough , and super oily .
not good .
i did n't enjoy any of it .
told it would take _num_ min and got hang up by that girl .
almost everyday after work i would order food and maybe get a drink .
the last thing i ordered was wings .
it was ok going down until i got home i became very sick .
the food here is not fresh .
ca n't believe how disrespectful the people here are .
i ordered food for _num_ of my friends .
seriously a child runs a lemonade stand better .
but it does n't end there .
i should be more careful paying for something i expect to receive .
i needed about _num_ napkins for the two slices i ate .
almost like it was fried .
overall , not that good .
the bartender who waited on us was this older lady who was completely rude .
the pizza was decent , the pepperoni rolls were better .
i might give them another chance , hoping for better service next time .
pizza was ok , bathrooms were nasty and prices were too high .
bartender was so rude .
i do n't get how this bar stays in business .
it was a thursday night with two other groups at the bar .
i would understand if it was busy but the bar was nearly empty .
all around terrible customer service .
will not be returning here , way too many other great bars .
this pizza place was one of the only options available for food .
ordered _num_ mini pizzas that are supposed be four slices each .
the are barely _num_ cutting it in half .
it was very greasy and much to be left to desire .
very disappointed .
it was a chicken with stuffing , mashed potatoes , and fresh vegetables .
i may have thought i had ... but i was wrong .
i do n't think he was very impressed .
i did n't like the coffee being served in styrofoam cups .
they were just barely ok .
wish it could have been more .
even my _num_ year old said the raisin french toast lacked flavor .
on the plus side , the prices were extremely reasonable .
breakfast for _num_ under $ _num_ .
a little later there was a plate in front of me .
it was pretty awful tasting .
all in all the meal was pretty pathetic .
unfortunately when the main course arrived i became quickly disappointed .
diners in nyc are friendlier .
bull !
service was awful .
it was obvious they were completely overwhelmed .
worst service ever .
then got rude when we tried to explain what happened and yelled at us .
great food , slow service .
we then sat there and waited an additional _num_ minutes .
still no service .
i 'm in downtown pittsburgh for the weekend and looking for sunday morning breakfast .
no worries , someone would surely be by soon to clear the table !
we probably waited 5-6 minutes before someone took the dishes away .
sadly not our food .
another waitress stops by with another few plates , also not our food .
i had _num_ eggs , sausage , hash browns , and pancakes .
the food was just plain bad .
the eggs and pancakes were cold .
that sausage was low quality links .
to add insult to injury , the place was filthy .
the seating area should be power washed .
very greasy and unorganized .
drama between workers can be overheard , making things even slower .
took _num_ min from ordering to being served food , which was tasted good .
sad news ... the salon has gone out of business .
no such attention here .
this place is just no bueno at all !
save your money and go to a cheaper hotel that is more accommodating !
i would n't send my worst enemy to this hotel .
she followed me around asking `` are you going to buy that ?
completely insane and ruined my entire thanksgiving .
complete waste of money and time to go to this hotel .
would i pay the suggested price of $ _num_ a night to stay here ?
we got the room for $ _num_ a night , which is reasonable .
visiting pittsburgh for pleasure ?
it was very disappointing .
i would n't buy a plate with my own money .
ew ... that kind of shaped my experience immediately .
i 'm livid about the sleep i lost and discomfort i had to experience .
i did n't feel safe to even leave my room .
that 's not customer service .
not worth the money !
never going back .
the lady that checked me in was extremely rude .
unfortunately , the wifi is not free unless you 're a special member .
there is a large shower but no bathtub .
our room was not great .
the bed was also older , and the room felt dated .
we were on a high floor , and the water pressure was not great .
i was unhappy with the service i received via phone .
our wifi was comped , but no points were given .
do yourself a favor and do n't waste your money on this place .
i mean , my money is green is n't it ?
also , wifi is not free .
that 's just insulting .
the service was good a friendly but prices were really just ridiculous .
the food was ... okay ... but not worth the money .
it was like a stale must .
do n't stay here .
we stayed here through a groupon deal .
for the price and the room size , there is much more out there .
i am now finding out that they charge for the internet .
$ _num_ groupon got us a small room with no free wi-fi .
i could n't imagine having paid $ _num_ or more at a regular rate .
high tea is n't very `` high '' at all .
not their fault - nobody trained them to handle tea .
no chance i would ever stay here if it was not offered on groupon .
disgusting !
stay away , save yourself some money , and go to another restaurant .
horrible horrible company .
do not rent from them at any cost .
then they refused to give us our deposit back .
will not rent from them for any amount of money in the world .
as for the corporation itself , words can not describe how horrible they were .
mary , the woman in charge of my property , was terrible .
there is not heat in winter in building .
manager is cheat on me , he did not turn on the heat system .
in terms of location , it was near perfect .
the ugly : absolutely not child friendly .
stay away from these ppl .
the poor guy lived there in such dangerous conditions for over a year .
_num_ stars .
my teriyaki chicken on toasted flat bread was okay , but only just okay .
again , not the worst thing in the world .
these are not luxury apartments .
the management could care less as long as they are paid .
it 's not worth it .
how many college students do you know living in `` luxury '' apartments ?
this place is a total joke .
never going back .
it 's _num_ days anywhere else .
it can be quite confusing .
you 'd be better off living anywhere but here for any length of time .
if you can avoid living here then do it .
_num_ % not worth the money .
walls are thin you can smell and hear everything coming from neighboring apartments .
they are not worth the money .
it 's noisy because of the construction work being done .
nowhere on the website stated that they are under construction .
the guy at the front desk is nice but clueless .
laundry room looks decent .
other places like grocery stores and restaurants are not within walking distance .
i have no idea where anything is in the building .
nothing is provided for you .
carts can not be reserved early .
so i say do n't bother with booking a time .
there 's only _num_ elevators for everyone to use .
this building has at least _num_ floors .
please check this apartment out before signing the lease .
learn from my mistake .
they do n't care once you signed the lease .
terrible !
did n't even apologize !
ruined my day .
if you 're following along , you know that i should really know better .
this restaurant should not be allowed to be affiliated with marriott .
the only meal that has been enjoyable was breakfast .
salad and pickles were moldy .
burger buns were stale .
wing sauce was n't right .
server accommodated with more sauce but not great .
ugh .
disappointing .
no sorry , or would i like something else .
trust me , walk the extra _num_ or _num_ minutes and get dinner downtown .
i ordered the clam chowder , which i was told was their popular item .
it came out looking like chunky sausage gravy .
the clams were chewy and way over cooked .
its almost _num_ hours since i ate there am still feeling sick .
two stars is a stretch .
the menu is very limited and the food is o.k .
she was neither friendly or accommodating .
the tour was just ok.
by then i was frustrated by the whole experience .
the staff was not friendly !
honestly , i 'm not sure what everyone is raving about .
our seats were really uncomfortable .
)
the driver was wonderful but the tour guide - just awful .
not us .
my regret is that i did n't write this sooner and get his name .
what a disappointment all around .
but this _num_ star review is for their horrible customer service .
_num_ of us met for dinner .
the food was good but nothing special .
waiter was not clear in explaining the fee .
tom agreed to call back with explanation but he never called back .
poor service !
_num_ of us wo n't be back because of this .
then i was steaming ... mad .
also , portions are much too large .
ridiculous customer service .
i 'll visit pittsburgh again sooner rather than later , but this place ?
overall very disappointing experience .
towels were pretty thin and yucky .
coffee in the room was terrible .
very disappointed in the staff 's ability to be helpful at this hotel .
the pillows were n't even comfortable , we both woke up with headaches .
not going to be going back .
i tried to secure them several times with no success .
all in all , a terrible night 's sleep .
i was not impressed with this place whatsoever .
the room was loud .
just all in all was n't that great .
the three of us finished it quickly and were still hungry .
the toppings were sparse and totally missing on some pieces .
i would not come back here .
the worst food , bar none , that i have ever been served .
the service was terrible .
the place was busy , but there were a few empty tables around us .
our waitress took at least _num_ minutes to do everything .
not impressed .
- servers not knowledgeable at all about their menu .
i am not a restaurant snob .
but the service at this particular location was pretty bad .
we ordered dessert , but our brownie sundae had no brownies .
mostly i felt bad for the servers .
the whole thing tasted and felt boxed and pre-made .
bland !
the pricing does not meet up to the food quality .
and overall ... there 's several better italian offerings in this city .
maybe , if enough folks in our group voted for it .
very poor service for an expensive meal !
was not offered bread , had to ask .
very below par .
do not get calamari , rubbery and again small portion for $ _num_ .
skip this one !
bad idea .
another bad idea .
actually , there are italian restaurants across the river or further up carson .
just avoid buca .
not going back to buca , in any city .
very bad this time .
came back tonight and was just plain horrible .
very bad experience , but only in town for business .
tonight i went to this location .
tonight was a disaster .
why did n't they bring the salad out first .
i declined because it was an insult .
with too many choices i wo n't be back .
i do n't like the decorations on the wall .
it looks like a spaghetti warehouse .
the food was much better the second time that i came here .
it also smells like a chuck e. cheese ball pit .
you could not pay me to go back there .
food was so-so , atmosphere was loud and cramped .
a mess from top to bottom .
we walked in at 8:00 .
another _num_ minutes to get our drinks .
he took our drinks off , we paid and left .
um yeah , no .
no free bread .
you lost me right there !
would n't go back without the discount .
my parents , sister and i ate here for lunch today .
i have also noticed the cleanliness standards are lacking in this place .
they need replaced !
i think little caesars pizza is better and cheaper .
the boys got the linguini and clams , nothing great .
we were all so disappointed , it was an expensive outing .
what kind of italian restaurant does not give bread ?
the service here is slow .
when i walked through the kitchen they seemed very confused and disorganized .
the carpets are old , worn , and dirty .
restrooms are not terribly clean , and in need of a major update .
the worst .
please just save yourself the trouble and pick somewhere else to eat .
carpeting is worn , faded , and filthy .
ugh - one of the absolute worst dining experiences .
each time , i 've become less impressed with their food .
however , the quality of their food is mediocre at best .
i looked around and there were quite a few empty booths .
before ordering our food , we had use the restroom .
the pizza was cheesy , saucy , and good .
there was more fried batter and cheese than eggplant , however .
i felt like i was chewing into a thick and slightly wet cheesy tempura .
no singing , no ice cream , nothing ... just a mediocre meal .
Negative
lots of recent negative reviews here on yelp about this location .
this was the second time i 've ever walked out of a restaurant .
service was talking forever and was already terrible .
contact info was provided and no one has contacted me .
do n't bother wasting your time or money going here .
i believe this is a serious health issue and sanitation concern .
it smelled horrible all around me .
the entire way up the disgusting odor was all around .
i did n't use it , i turned around and returned to the lobby .
i am not going to say what i did with the food .
do not eat here .
went to this restaurant last week and it was awful .
do not waste your money .
the lobby smelled like sewage .
we ordered garlic bread , rigatoni , and chicken marsala .
the chicken was very dry and barely edible .
no waitress either .
hoping to find a bite before my next call .
i wish i could give this restaurant zero stars .
it was the worst experience of my life .
food was terrible .
service was horrible .
the experience i had will force me never ever to go back .
they offered to comp my garlic bread for my poor experience .

bathrooms were a disgrace .

it was a wednesday at _num_ .
maybe _num_ tables were there and plenty of staff .
but everything else about this restaurant is gone .
it 's a chain , i get that , more on that later .
not anymore .
i guess cold is the theme for the meal .
if they were n't cold , i would have had seconds ) .
green beans ( cold ) .
pasta dish was cold on the top and hot on the bottom .
i likely will not return to buca .
resturant was not very busy but the service was quite slow .
it was basically like flat bread with cheese .
no real seasoning or flavor whatsoever .
had dinner here sunday evening with relatives from out of state .
i was very disappointed with every aspect .
the meatballs were decent but the marinara sauce was watery and sparse .
we also tried some lasagna which tasted okay but was mushy .
buying flowers online for delivery has been so disappointing .
ordering arrangements online is just not cutting it .
my expectations were n't too high to begin with .
i originally took my car here because my timing belt had failed .
at this point my car , an old toyota , was starting to go .
i will never return to this garage for any car repairs or service .
having been born and raised in chicago it was a familiar concept .
yes , as i said , i 'm from out of town .
i opted for the hot sausage with cheese .
first , the waiter did n't write down our order .
three of the sandwich orders were wrong and most were cold .
it is a subway , though , so we 're not talking gourmet .
as a facility , the place is all old-school pittsburgh steel construction .
really awkward .
if you do , lower your expectations .
so , i figure its a fluke right ?
are you effing kidding me ?
like , strips it like and effing cheap ass screw .
nothing !
bad : the parking and the crowd .
thought it was nothing special .
was the definition of a dive bar , smoky , dimly lit and crowded .
for a dive bar i thought the beers were a little expensive .
the sandwich was mediocre , and the fries were soggy and limp .
it was surprisingly empty and thus very relaxing .
plenty of arm room and i could have a normal conversation .
i 'm not big fan of joe 's .
it is n't that i did n't enjoy my food and the service .
the drinks and appetizers came out very quickly as did our main meal .
too quickly .
we had barely dug into the appetizers when the entrees were brought out .
it was tasty , but did n't seem as flavorful as i had expected .
overall , food was decent and service was ok .
drove into pittsburgh really late at night .
they 're in michigan and our birthdays are two days apart from each other .
just not in michigan .
your utensils are presented in buckets .
but we were n't going for fancy .
hate .
but i will eat cornbread and other various things made of corn .
the crab nachos were made with a mayo like paste .
if we want to talk about sick , that was my drink .
the waiter joked saying , `` it might be too spicy for you ! ''
it was n't too spicy for me .
it was just disgusting tasting .
we do n't actually need a joe 's crab shack in new york .
at best , it 's just another red lobster minus those cheesy biscuits .
i had low expectations , but i do n't feel those were even met .
the food here is greasy and over-cooked , and not all that appetizing .
i 'm not a fan of joe 's .
i was treated very badly there today by the truly awful hostess .
horrible experience as i 'm typing this .
to say our experience there was less than desirable would be a great understatement !
needless to say we are very disappointed .
the crab was over cooked , the fried fish was soggy and deep brown .
atmosphere _num_ ( it 's pittsburgh how can you score bad ! )
the crab was bland and half of the clams were just shells .
but this time i was very disappointed .
it 's a chain restaurant , i did n't have high expectations .
i asked for mine with no mussels .
i understood , i just really hate mussels but liked scallops .
my friends mahi just sucked .
it was cold .
also no happy hour except on tuesday .
did n't have a good experience there last night .
waited for ever ... wo n't b back !
slow service and mediocre food at best .
calamari breading had no seasoning , the grilled shrimp were very overdone and tough .
worst restaurant experience i 've had in years .
if i could give place zero stars i would .
we sat down and waited ... and waited ... and waited .
_num_ minutes later a waiter came by and took our drinks order .
_num_ min passed by and we asked to speak with a manager .
stay the hell away !
not allergy friendly at all .
she ordered a simple shrimp salad with no croutons .
needless to say my beautiful wife opted to not to eat there .
this was my first ( and most certainly last ) visit to this restaurant .
the dinners were served _num_ minutes later .
each of the six entrees were lukewarm .
the fries were cold .
the shrimp had no old bay seasoning .
popcorn shrimp was void of any flavor whatsoever .
after that there just is n't much more to say that is positive .
not really worth the price .
i always get the crab daddy feast .
probably just gon na go to red lobster .
it takes a lot to make someone that sick .
i wo n't be going back .
this restaurant sits inside the sheraton hotel atrium .
a train will pass along every _num_ minutes .
service was awkward and slow on the saturday night i was there .
pittsburgh rare was kind of unimpressive for the price .
went with a party of _num_ for my friends bachelor party .
made me wish i liked eating them .
would have skipped the underwhelming dessert had i know it was coming .
our group 's wine snob described the wine list as `` terrible . ''
nobody likes him though .
our waitress did n't seem to know what beers they had .
the draft selection was limited to bud 's finest .
slow drink refills , very long time between courses .
we may go back , but i doubt it .
the great tasting food , does n't make up for the horrible service .
let me start with the very beginning .
after some time , she brought out our drinks .
we were sitting and enjoying our company , and ordered our first courses .
she never described anything about the menu or made any recommendations .
the server said nothing more and walked away .
the drinks came ten minutes later , half delivered by another server .
the food came out _num_ minutes later .
however , no one ever came by to ask how it was .
unfortunately , it ruins the experience .
sadly , this experience was so awful i had to write about it .
usually , i never really feel the need to say anything about it .
i can guarantee that none of us will ever return here .
horrible place .
horrible in every sense of the word .
by friday afternoon , i had emailed my application to eric .
i have never been so frustrated .
complete bs !
this is the worst mcdonald 's i 've ever been to .
same issue .
would n't recommend it to anyone .
it was some of the worst food i have ever tasted .
however , this spot missed the mark .
if i could give less than a star i would .
this restaurant tried to steal my money .
i did n't read the sign at the beginning of the line .
they piss me off every time .
they always gets orders wrong .
food is not fresh and hot .
i would not go there for months and the service is terrible every time .
the staff do not greet customers .
they do not keep the dining room clean .
they frequently run out of condiments and or napkins for the dining area .
i would have to say i have received the worst service from there consistently .
this place claims it is open until 2am but it never is .
worst customer service ever and i will never go back to support this establishment .
it took me _num_ minutes to even get my order .
they gave me a steak calzone .
it was pretty much inedible .
and to add insult to injury , it was $ _num_ .
anyway , my first experience was decent .
side note : i do n't understand how restaurants fail to properly drain noodles .
the second experience was awful .
this is american diner food , i.e .
i have n't found anything remarkable during my visits here .
i prefer to avoid the place .
do `` huge portions '' of mediocre food warrant _num_ or _num_ stars ?
the bakery and meat selection is very limited .
the sales associates are as poor as the store location .
all that to say is avoid this giant eagle if possible .
the front entrance is dirty and smells .
this is a gas station and not a restaurant .
chicken cooked in burnt oil and taste horrible .
went to two locations only to discover the first one was not a mistake .
not worth the $ _num_ cab fare .
however , this will not be a business i support again .
i dropped off pants and a suit jacket to be dry cleaned .
my tech used a powder and liquid just like they do for acrylics .
my nails could have been shaped better .
i do not recommend this place .
my mother 's was $ _num_ higher than my sister 's .
when asked about it , they conveniently `` did n't understand english . ''
i think that it is rude .
sooooo disappointed !
i asked if i could order them , i was told `` no '' .
when ordering by phone they quoted the wrong price .
found out on pick-up and they would n't honor the quote they gave .
staff was extremely rude to the point of being near hostile .
i 'm amazed that they 've managed to stay in business this long .
overpriced garbage .
actually yelling at me for wanting them to correct my order .
this is the worst mcdonald 's i 've ever been to .
they 're always rude .
they 're slow .
i 'd rather drive further to another mcdonalds .
i had _num_ cars ahead of me and it took over _num_ minutes .
the burger and fries were barely warm .
the service is worse , if that is possible .
i wo n't be back .
they have an experience of having horrible service at this location .
the cheese blend is the only good thing about the pizza .
heck , i 've made bad pizza that was better than this .
just , ugh .
so bad .
pizza that tastes like pizza .
after my mothers experience today i will never ever use them again !
it was a terrible piece of meat .
i came out smelling like an ash tray .
my advice : skip michael 's !
i made the mistake of yelping this place the morning we were going .
at $ _num_ , i was over it .
then , a basket of bread came out .
our meals included soup or salad , potato , and a vegetable .
just like grandma would make .
however , the soup was not the quality of grandma 's .
not too impressed .
another table got the salads , and the salads looked sad .
it was mostly fat and apparently pretty awful .
these things were stuffed with filler and the portion was tiny .
the sides , however , were pretty good .
michael 's recipes are ok , but the food prices are simply not acceptable .
this place is awful .
the most awful food and the prices for the quality are terrible .
however this place failed .
the steak and fish was over cooked and tasteless .
not mention the bread was stale .
never going back .
i am so disappointed in michael 's .
an empty restaurant on a saturday evening is a huge sign .
i hate to give it _num_ star , because it truly should be zero .
no stars from me .
zero !
but yelp needs one so there it is .
it was crazy noisy and the staff did n't seem to even notice .
wrong .
our meal was very cheap , but that 's not good enough for me .
unfortunately i was not impressed .
the pasta was awful .
it expanded to the size of a sausage and ruined my meal .
i will not be back .
for what they charge you would think their customer service would be stellar .
should 've went to whole foods .
and if i could give zero stars i would .
_num_ minutes to get a bottle of water .
issues taking an order for _num_ blizzards .
seating on the street outside was cleaner than the booths .
staff was a mess and all over the place .
_num_ stars .
this dairy queen is horrible .
the employees do not know how to do their job .
completely disorganized and not clean .
corporate needs to review this shit hole of a store .
this place provided the worst service i 've had in a long time .
i wo n't be going back .
not enough employees on staff to keep up with demand causing long wait time .
the blizzards and sundaes are not well made .
not many toppings or candy in them .
along with all of that , they are very over priced .
$ _num_ for a large blizzard that is mostly ice cream .
alway have awful service .
there were _num_ people waiting at the counter .
i went through the drive thru and was not greeted .
i asked for a chocolate cone with sprinkles and got no response again .
she closed the window and walked away with no response .
this has to be the worst dq ever .
service is incredibly painfully slow too .
the food is mediocre at best , and the customer service is poor .
i have been disappointed each time .
terrible .
most of all , the waitress was terrible .
food was bland and tasteless .
waited over a hr for a table just to be disappointed .
poor service and luke warm food are always a step in the wrong direction .
my daughter bought a chicken sandwich yesterday and it was soaking and soggy .
like it was dipped in grease .
horrible service and food .
horrible do n't waste your time .
it had no flavor whatsoever .
do n't waste your money coming here .
not this time .
it was ridiculous .
fail .
in terms of customer service , my girl seemed a little clueless .
this was such a let down .
instead of assisting me , the manager said `` those are too expensive . ''
he looked about _num_ ) did my massage .
i actually started laughing at one point it was so absurd .
avoid this place .
do n't be sucked in by the relatively low prices .
no , i take that back .
you get far less than you pay for .
not worth it .
no questions asked .
surprisingly , the dining room really was n't as busy as it first appeared .
that feeling quickly changed to dread .
but sorry , not worth the wait .
it 's mediocre ( at best ) food .
stopped in for sunday lunch .
restaurant itself was dirty and greasy .
fries were low quality and tasteless .
this review is true , i am not joking nor exaggerating .
i was not disappointed .
my server was a young lady with glasses and she was very inattentive .
i hear they have a breakfast buffet on saturday and sunday .
it says this in all the online ads for the hotel as well .
to date , we are still waiting for that amount to be refunded .
it was alright , nothing special .
it barely had any filling on it which annoyed me .
try this place if you want a belly ache and need to pass gas .
place was disgusting !
wait staff walked by us several times .
the food was nothing special .
if they are busy , skip this place .
nothing was memorable other than long wait for an empty restaurant and cold food .
it 's fries topped with their pot roast and gravy and some cheese .
it was really disappointing .
no thanks .
the atmosphere felt a little traditional and dated .
both the service and food were unimpressive .
but then again , these restaurants always seemed to copy each other 's menus .
they basically just serve dishes that are nothing special .
i 've had the salmon , completely under seasoned , overcooked and dry .
mediocre food .
terrible customer service .
several servers passed by ; no offer to assist .
_num_ minutes was _num_ hour .
there were 1/2 of the tables empty .
i feel terrible for the hostess and wait staff .
into trying somewhere new , and avoiding chain casual dining whenever possible , esp .
_num_ stars .
my burger was gross .
it had clearly been sitting under a hot lamp for a while .
fries were that weird - have been sitting out texture .
well , i did n't even feel a buzz .
it has to have been watered down .
anyway i was pretty disappointed .
totally a nightmare .
what a disaster lunch .
with this management they will not be around for long .
this place is not what it once was .
Negative
sorry to be so negative , it has earned it however .
greasy and about as flavorful and tender as chewing on an old leather shoe .
ugh .
the plate was a mess .
i would be hard pressed to every find myself inside penn brewery otherwise .
the food that did arrive was pretty mediocre .
the steak sandwiches were tough and dry .
the salads had too much red onion .
the potato soup was bland except for being too salty .
the only thing positive of this visit was that the beer was good .
i did n't drink anything because i was n't in the mood .
overall my meal was just bland .
not bad but not really good .
overall the food was mediocre .
fail !
the beer choices were limited to _num_ draft brews and some bottled beer .
the beer was okay not outstanding .
no oktoberfest or pumpkin beers .
worst place ever !
so disappointed and will never waste my time going back .
the only thing available were frozen veggie burgers and really thin fried pork .
service was pretty bad too .
had every appetizer last night for a work party and every one was bad .
hell .
for the food , anyway .
the service here , however , leaves something to be desired .
no one came , and no one came .
this woman was so rude .
dave matthews cover band .
its terrible .
this place is a disappointment .
never experienced this problem before with groupons .
glad i called ahead of time .
menu are now also gone .
nope , patio not open until _num_ .
it was fine , but it sure is n't worth $ _num_ .
$ _num_ for _num_ pieces of sausage ?
disappointed in the changes ... .
i never like seeing a restaurant staff eat food from another restaurant .
i like their beer but not a good experience this time .
beer was good but food was mediocre at best .
i will not be going there ever again because i did not feel welcome .
not impressed with service .
i 've given this place _num_ tries .
i wo n't try again .
food service quality when one would expect scratch german cooking .
to boot , our food was n't right and they forgot my soup .
not even close .
sat down at a table for _num_ in the bar area .
this place should be ashamed of its unbelievably poor customer service .
truly appalling .
by far one of the worst experiences i 've ever had .
did n't have half the beer on the list .
waitress came to our table every _num_ minutes !
waited another _num_ mins to get out beer .
i have been waiting for my check now for _num_ minutes as well .
i was very disappointed in my steak last night .
over half of it was fat and i could not even eat it .
also , my companions did not really care for their food either .
i was so disappointed today !
the braised red cabbage was missing something .
i was so sad .
penn brewery has just gone down hill .
the pretzels were way too salty .
there 's really no reason to come here .
quite loud and the food is mediocre .
service was terrible .
waitress barely came to our table and was not very friendly .
my boyfriend got a chicken sandwich and the chicken was n't even seasoned .
got an oktoberfest beer that tasted very cheap and had no flavor .
atmosphere awful .
or get a better night 's sleep .
we were talking about the bad experience as we left .
wo n't be back .
the food was cold and bland .
the restaurant did n't seem that busy but obviously the kitchen was backed up .
no food was had .
sorry , we do n't serve that beer outside .
it was brought out with no explanation .
there are much , much better choices around pittsburgh for my tastes .
apparently we just could n't use it .
pay to cook my food ?
not worth the dough !
the main courses i feel are garbage .
this is overpriced nonsense .
these things do not add up .
would n't choose to come here again .
the wait staff was totally rude .
the food was nothing to rave about considering the prices .
i was not very impressed at all !
in general i was n't a fan of the whole experience !
worst .
the cheese fondue appetizer was good ; but the entrees were tasteless .
this was the most lackluster dining experience that i have had in years .
i visited the melting pot as my friday choice for restaurant week .
the second course was an apple bacon spinach salad .
the third course was a chef choice platter .
this is sad because i know they have an amazing chocolate peanut butter fondue .
but since the servings are plentiful i just could n't eat anymore .
i do not understand how this place stays in business .
do n't believe what you read though .
the service was horrible .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
coke and iced tea ( drinks ) - _num_ minutes after the soup .
_num_ .
kung pao chicken ( entree ) - _num_ minutes after our drinks arrived .
_num_ .
dumplings ( appetizer ) - a good _num_ minutes after the kung pao chicken .
i did n't finish eating anything .
at $ _num_ per person , this is quite overpriced .
gluten free chinese outside of my regular relationship with pf ?
nope ... hot it was n't .
needless to say , i was disappointed .
chinese food ... really you 've turned your back on me !
this restaurant is really nothing special .
nothing to walk all the way down wood street from grant street for .
really , hardly any care goes into the preparation of their dishes .
it 's greasy , soggy limp veggies served on rock hard dried out rice .
they would n't deliver to me bc i ordered only one item .
she said , `` i no drive to you for _num_ dollars . ''
i said , `` please , i 'll tip . ''
she said , `` i 'll be there in _num_ minutes . ''
they have _num_ waitresses for the entire lunch rush which does n't make sense .
when we went to leave there was no one to ring us out .
they wiped down a dirty table with a gross and used rag .
this ai n't no sesame inn .
not even the same caliber as chinatown in .
delivery service , however , is beyond terrible !
their customer service also leaves something to be desired .
no customer service , no regard for customer orders , just terrible .
i was quickly seated at a booth and given a menu to look over .
my hot and sour soup followed shortly behind .
i was beginning to like this place .
remember that old commercial `` where 's the beef '' ?
all you could taste and all you could see was this doughy coating .
do n't believe me ?
it 's that mess on the napkin .
the shrimp is on top and the dough is on the bottom .
would i have had to wait three hours for that ?
so i just left .
all i ordered was soup , something you have already made .
also , there was only one table in the restaurant with customers .
you can not tell me that you were slammed , or had other issues .
i stopped in with a friend who came downtown specifically to have lunch .
i took another bite and the chicken tasted old - reheated or something .
it just did n't taste right .
i said that may be the case , but it tasted awful .
that is hardly _num_ % !
needless to say , we will not be back .
understaffed for a busy lunch , you will see wait staff running .
the service was terrible .
when we got to the restaurant , there were only seven occupied tables .
it took about _num_ minutes for the waitress to take our order .
we normally start our tip at _num_ % and go up from there .
the service experience was so bad here , we left _num_ % .
the basics , the specials , the chef 's specials etc .
it 's good food , it 's just not anything special .
but , again it 's just not special .
for the main courses sesame chicken and singapore rice noodle .
was not a happy meal .
maybe there is just not a market for chinese food here in pittsburgh .
not authentic at all .
too greasy , oily and way too sweet .
i was not impressed with the services either .
upsetting bc of the drive to get down here and paid for parking .
foul tasting chicken .
i do n't know what else could make me so sad .
believe it or not , i like history museums .
little children do n't care about reading lots of text .
they also do n't care if adults want to read lots of text .
adults may enjoy the museum , but kids will probably be pretty bored .
i took my car in to get new brakes & rotors .
very disappointed with this .
horrible customer service .
the biggest problem here is the lighting .
it 's simply too bright and it kills the vibe .
it was a little hard to watch since dean is so friendly .
they were cold , mushy and tasteless .
i would never get them again .
my mom ordered the reuben and my dad ordered a cheese steak .
the pepperoni roll was not that great .
the coleslaw was tasteless .
shame on you , modern cafe !
i donate , i have adopted .
i drop off supplies .
antibiotics are _num_ $ .
_num_ $ antibiotics vs kill the kitty .
also the staff is very rude .
especially the miserable lady that takes orders .
this was an atrocious response to a pleasant request .
they own a business in a neighborhood and they insult the residents .
however , it was an additional _num_ minutes before the food was ready !
several other people were also waiting for orders , some left in frustration .
we will not return , the food was not worth the wait time .
adequate ?
the biggest wings in the burgh or undercooked and bloody around the bone .
they have shady people in there all hours of the day .
the cheese and sauce they use on their pizzas is completely tasteless and flavorless .
now it just plain stinks .
the service sucks , the food sucks , the prices suck .
on top of that they have a severe attitude problem .
poker machine gambling hole .
sorry , stomach .
both locations i called had terrible phone service .
i ordered a buffalo wing pizza which tasted like greasy bread .
they also failed to include the ranch dressing ( s ! )
another time i was asked what size fries i wanted .
i went outside and asked him why he just hung up .
no one has ever stood there before . ''
it 's just unbelievable how rude these people are .
an hour later and still a no show .
i 'm not sure who i was talking to .
so i will spend my money elsewhere .
unfortunately for me , i have a very nice sound system in my car .
when i dropped off the car , it was tuned to the cd player .
i even went back to the car to get cds out .
unfortunately for me , i have a very nice sound system in my car .
when i dropped off the car , it was tuned to the cd player .
i even went back to the car to get cds out .
they are bad even in comparison to other fast food places .
this mcdonald 's is the worst i have ever , ever been too .
i 've never experienced anything like it in my life .
the service is crazy awful .
do n't waste a second of your life !
it is so bad it is unreal .
if zero stars was an option this would be the place !
dirty floors , dirty counters , rude employees , broken equipment , slow service .
this mcdonald 's really sets the brand standard .
not sure what was wrong .
literally sat here for _num_ minutes .
zero stars is more accurate than _num_ star .
this is literally the worst mcdonald 's on the planet .
avoid this location at all costs .
i allowed extra time for parking since its off street parking .
some practices may be limited on what they can do of course .
the signs and displays were outdated and not accurate for what was actually there .
for the price of $ _num_ per adult i expected more than this .
i am not sure if we will be going back .
this is not that big of a deal , simply inconvenient .
what a terrible disappointment !
i had _num_ adults in my party and _num_ kids .
wrong .
the tour itself was n't bad .
the lack of professionalism and organization by the company just made matters worse .
it also seems like more employees need to be walking around to squash that .
i have come to really not like our zoo .
for the cost there are n't enough animals to see .
the aquarium is n't that great , nothing great in there .
adults were $ _num_ and kids were $ _num_ .
worst zoo i have been to .
the playground was awful .
this zoo was below average at best .
after visiting the pittsburgh zoo i can claim , not impressed .
missing animals in exhibits , or just not at this zoo at all .
walking in tube through water side by side to a shark was cool .
zoo definitely needs improvements .
the exhibits are tiny , and watching those animals suffer is just awful .
the zoo was n't even busy that day .
my out of town guests saw pittsburgh represented in this disgusting dirty zoo .
pittsburgh zoo , get it together .
they all looked bored or sad or something .
the only thing i sort of enjoyed was the aquarium .
i 'm definitely glad i did n't buy a membership here .
pittsburgh zoo is not the freshest zoo in the country .
* our biggest complaint with the zoo is the children 's play area .
the pittsburgh zoo is pretty mediocre .
the zoo itself was very small and had very few animals .
it was n't very memorable and there were no scheduled shows .
they 've lost a couple waitresses recently and the service has gone way downhill .
on top of it they make you spend $ _num_ to use a card .
i would rather grab a $ _num_ sub across the street .
greyhound in pittsburgh gets no stars based on my experience today .
so did _num_ other people .
i did get a refund , but it was n't with a smile .
i transferred in pittsburgh and boy was it an experience .
also , people there were so rude !
beyond rude !
left denver for pittsburgh .
hell .
where customer service goes to die .
the worst , always and forever .
never using greyhound again .
is there such thing as zero stars here ?
really the worst .
i thought these bad reviews were just people being cry sacks .
pittsburgh 's greyhound has horrible customer service .
worst bus to travel on ever .
the worst of all of the greyhound stations i 've been too .
no _num_ stars ?
this is why greyhound is known as `` the dirty dog '' .
i will never use greyhound again .
even before getting on the bus the experience was really poor .
the terminal was a state of confusion .
as i 'm writing this , i 'm leaving _num_ hours late .
there are hardly any cheap direct flights from pittsburgh .
only positive aspect : free wifi .
i went to customer service and the guy brushed me off .
he was like but you didnt tell me that .
you handed in your ticket you didnt say anything .
how am i supposed to know your second bag is free .
i didnt say those things bc i just dont want things to get weird .
no wonder it rates this low , the services are so bad .
the lines are usually very inefficient and poorly organized .
there 's not structure to the process .
if it were possible i would rather walk than take it again .
if it were possible to give no stars , i surely would .
greyhound is definitely one of the worst ways to travel .
anyways , the buses are very nasty .
pittsburgh has the rudest employees i have ever met .
the drivers are usually a hit or miss .
the wifi does n't ever work on the buses either .
my _num_ hour trip turned into a _num_ hour trip .
nasty !
if i could give this place a rating of _num_ , i would have .
there was n't really anyone in line .
things should have gone relatively smoothly .
a lot of time was wasted in this struggle .
this was entirely a lie , as no one was holding anything .
i get my ticket and he tells me to go down to door _num_ .
i get there and the bus is gone .
utterly ridiculous .
also refused to let my grandmother speak to her boss .
terrible experience .
the seats were small and there were barely any space for anything else .
the apartment was well located and the maintenance folks are a friendly bunch .
however the experience with the management was horrible .
that being said , like the other reviews , the problem is the management .
her alone is not worth living here .
stay away from this apartment until she is hopefully fired .
really rude and disrespectful !
other locations should n't , and we do n't . ''
this is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard .
it was 6:00 p.m. on a wednesday .
my husband ordered steamed dumplings .
soup was just barely lukewarm & way over salted .
egg roll was greasy , cold & tasteless .
only the hot mustard saved it .
ordered chicken with cashew nuts .
food very cold .
only item that was hot was the complimentary tea .
but this time it was n't so great .
food was - unfortunately - really not very good .
the shrimp looked huge when i got them , so i was excited .
and i mean tiny , like 1/2 inch size .
sorry , but never again .
the chicken was chewy and stringy and was either overcooked or sat for days .
i would not wish this restaurant upon my worst enemy .
the food here was ok , but the service was absolutely horrible .
we were disappointed .
i told them to fail the inspection and took it to an independent mechanic .
the charge was $ _num_ dollars for a $ _num_ absolute max job .
after coming here for two years for minor service , i 've had enough .
prices very cheap .
i smoke but the place bothered me .
bathroom ugh but it was the end of the night .
after all , i did see dart boards and pool tables through the window .
so , why two stars instead of one ?
there 's no way i could 've heard that correctly .
do n't pay good money for this .
do not buy season tickets .
becoming tired of poor treatment by the organization .
are you fucking kidding me ?
i would give them a minus _num_ if i could ... .
Positive
if there was a negative star rating , yellow cab pittsburgh would get it .
Negative
try negative _num_ .
but _num_ hour later , still no cab .
what a horrible feeling , to be stranded .
horrible .
i called dispatch , they said the cab was n't coming !
they had nothing available and recommended i keep calling back .
skip calling yellow cab .
worst experience , nearly missed my flight .
call again _num_ minutes later , same message .

terrible experience .
_num_ minutes outside the city , if that . )
an hour and a half later , nothing .
i hopped in and the man greeted me by name !
the cab was clean and he was a safe driver .
that 's not something unusual at all .
i do n't have time for things like this .
just get out of my cab . ''
this city needs some competition for this company .
this time i did n't make it .
five minutes passed , and no cab .
terrible service , unreliable , try anyone else before you call these people .
rude on the phone , showed up an hour late !
it 's not that they are running their business well .
they have _num_ % lost my business for all time .
cabs in pittsburgh are not like cabs in other cities .
in chicago , cabs are part of the transportation landscape .
so i need to get downtown on a saturday morning by _num_ am .
but it 's really annoying .
seriously - do n't say _num_ minutes and then it 's _num_ minutes .
i 'm tempted to call and complain - this guy was the worst .
out of all the cities i 've lived in yellow cab is the worst .
wish i could give them no stars !
i 'm still waiting for my cab from last night .
absolute worst cab service provider in pittsburgh .
edit : just denied again on dec _num_ by cab _num_ .
his light went off and said he was n't standing and left .
zero stars if that was an option .
seriously , this is the worst cab company i 've ever dealt with .
i 've waited as much as three and a half hours for a cab .
are you kidding me ?
we were standing right there about to walk over to the cab .
i would n't recommend yellow cab to my worst enemy .
their service is horrific and unprofessional !
probably the worst run business i have ever dealt with in my entire life .
this business is terrible .
she called yellow cab in pittsburgh .
she was finally picked up _num_ hours after her first phone call .
she told me no , that type of technology does n't exist .
how 's that for utterly insane ?
we booked a cab through taxi magic .
but no word from yellow cab in over an hour .
meanwhile , the elite yelp _num_ 's party is partying away without us .
communication fail , delivery fail , customer service fail .
i can no longer count on this service to get me anywhere on time .
not cool man .
not cool .
in a word : unacceptable .
this is the absolute worst taxi service ever .
waiting for them to come is like waiting for a turtle to come .
unfortunately , i hear that it is the only taxi service in the area .
the most ridiculous experience i have ever been part of in any city .
he was wrong because it never showed up .
i walked down the street to a hotel and flagged one down .
are you kidding me ?
worst cab service ever !
never seen this bad .
i called the company they again said it is _num_ minutes away .

horrible taxi service .
if you 're on a schedule like we were , do n't call them .
poor customers service .
i do not usually write yelp reviews .
i scheduled a cab to bring me to a job interview .
i am from out of town and was only in pittsburgh for said interview .
the cab never showed up .
Negative
if i could rate this in negative stars , i would .
yellow cab , shame on you !
it 's been two hours and counting .
yes , the weather 's bad , but this is ridiculous .
i could have walked home , back downtown and halfway back home by now .
now that my appointment is over i 've been waiting and waiting and waiting .
Negative
if i could give it negative fifty stars , i would .
easily the worst experience i 've ever had with a cab company .
Negative
i wish i could leave negative stars .
ok , no big deal .
not even later in the morning !
useless .
yellow cab is the only cab and it is atrocious .
until this changes this city will still be stuck in the 80s .
Negative
i also wish i could give a negative review .
which is why i called a week ahead to make the reservation .
even then i should have known they were horrible .
ordered a cab last night for _num_ this morning .
its going on _num_ and still no one is here .
called another company and they should be here in _num_ minutes .
i entered cab # _num_ and had driver # _num_ .
the taxi never showed up .
feeling stranded in a city sucks .
the city needs a better taxi service !
the staff is incompetent , rude and greedy .
do not call these idiots ever .
i am not even exaggerating .
the worst .
ugh , this cab service is awful .
the cabs in pittsburgh know you need them and dont care about you .
this is definitely a horrible horrible horrible company .

i called yellow cab over an hour before i really needed to leave .
the cab went to the wrong place .
huge mistake .
it took us over two hours to figure out how we 'd get home .
Negative
really negative stars if it was an option .
another _num_ minutes later no cab .
i missed the train and lost my fare .
they stay at the hotel not picking up anyone .
i guess their employees hate money ?
i make the desperate mistake of calling yellow cab a couple times per year .
and ended up getting into a cab that randomly showed up on the street .
did you expect me to wait four hours for you ?
i almost missed a business meeting because this company is unprofessional and unreliable .
she then claimed the cab had came , called me , and left .
yo fuck this cab company .
my friend left his wallet in the cab .
yes , i 'm sure that 's my zip , i live here !
no confirmation number given - i asked .
no call , no show .
absolute crap of service .
i do not recommend them once so ever .
next time i 'm in town i will be finding another way around .
thanks a lot you ruined our day .
what , open it ?
do not use this company !
also i am specifically calling out cab # _num_ .
)
worst .
horrible service !
do n't waste your time .
they have you wait hours only to tell you they ca n't ride you .
and once each of the last _num_ weeks .
the cab drivers decide which calls they want and which ones do n't .
there is at least _num_ cabs there at any given time .
so ridiculous !
needless to say i did not give a tip .
the drivers are rude and the cars are dirty .
this is a terrible car service .
when i called they kept telling me it was _num_ minutes away .
yellow cab is straight up awful .
as soon as i got in and said hello ... dead silence .
my car broke down which is the only reason i called a cab .
if i could give zero stars i would .
horrible !
reserved a cab the night before i needed it .
i missed a flight because nobody bothered to pick up my order .
worst taxi service ever !
they left me waiting for an hour and never sent anyone to get me .
i called to complain and they said i should go with another taxi service .
horrible place to work .
yellow cab is terrible .
my uber driver picked me up _num_ minutes after requesting .
Positive
i wish i could leave some sort of `` negative star '' .
i had the worst experience last night with yellow cab .
ten minutes later a driver called and said he was on his way .
nobody stopped for half an hour .
i called the driver back and told me i was n't there .
so i called yc a third time .
it really sucked .
i am getting the lift app , you should too .
this company is horrible and sketchy .
Very negative
i would even put negative if i could .
never use yellow if you need to get to your destination !
too bad zero stars is not an option !
apparently they do n't want my money .
cancelled the cab ... finding another option .
i would like to give them _num_ stars .
the driver did not say two words to us .
i want to like the shadyside market .
but i hate overpriced basics , blah sandwiches , and rude staff .
unfortunately , most of the time they are closed .
i wo n't be back .
)
drove here , paid for parking , this place does n't exist anymore .
ugh .
i miss this store , it was so convenient .
it 's closed now , they have several mall locations .
in the past , i had a simple bagel and cream cheese order confused .
on this particular visit , the soda machine was also broken .
that 's too bad .
there are worse chains and worse fast food joints than panera .
but i 'm not a big fan .
fairly busy , and has an unfriendly atmosphere .
the ca n't give a s & % !
this is not up to the standard of other panera 's i have frequented .
worst panera we have ever stopped at .
first grilled cheese was `` burnt '' on bottom .
manager was nice and gave money back .
new chicken green salad was terrible .
years old but looking worn and little dirty .
why do i keep coming here ?
four outlets for customer use in the whole place ?
gross .
everything tasted okay but the prices were beyond ridiculous .
( example : $ _num_ for two pieces of salmon ) .
the advertised `` mixed green salad '' was cut with iceberg lettuce .
the teriyaki chicken tasted like something i ate in high school _num_ years ago .
the teriyaki chicken tasted like something i ate in high school _num_ years ago .
instead i got low end sushi for a high end price .
the service was _num_ stars so feel bad giving two .
so _num_ stars minus two stars equals really bad sushi .
food was downright poor .
skip it and find another .
sushi was small portions at large prices .
they must have worked hard to slice the sushi so thin .
spent too much for too little .
the quality was n't anything to write about so i wo n't .
if you really like sushi , you probably should go here .
if you do not specifically enjoy sushi , this is not for you .
to preface , i despise sushi .
going there was not my idea .
obviously , i did not order sushi .
wrong .
it was n't enjoyable .
it is kind of drab and has a tired and dated look .
the decor is dated and a bit depressing .
it is quite expensive relative to other gyms of similar caliber .
classes were fairly limited at this location .
go to the mills or waterfront instead .
a bottled water ( _num_ oz ) is $ _num_ .
a cup of water ( under _num_ oz ) is $ _num_ .
the manager was not helpful , just said `` sucks to be you '' .
the customer service all in all was terrible .
this is a terrible theater !
i have no idea why i am here again !
they would n't honor it .
i will not be back .
the staff is rude and during the movies the audience is so loud !
terrible !
i knew this was my chance to escape this hell hole .
wrong !
terrible !
no compensation offered .
one waitress at lunchtime equals extremely slow service .
the delivery time was spot-on if not earlier than quoted .
most likely would not order from here again .
i get regular acrylic fills .
basically said he would file it down , which he did n't .
do n't waste your time and money .
should n't have given him $ _num_ !
our server was just rude .
we tried to be nice but she never even cracked a smile .
i ordered mac & cheese and my husband ordered a _num_ taco plate .
we were both disappointed by the very small servings .
not that hard !
around _num_ minutes passed without anyone greeting us for service or removing the dishes .
she apologized and cleaned off our table .
at least _num_ minutes passed .
i 'd give this place zero stars if possible .
i wish i could get my order back .
service was very slow .
we never had water , beer , silverware or napkins .
the trio was gross .
guacamole awful .
the bathroom had no toilet paper and was filthy .
waitresses were not friendly at all .
not really .
super sweet weak drinks and mediocre food .
it was a pretty big party & some major cash was spent .
wonder how many drunk people accidentally tipped _num_ % that night ?
this was the worst meal i have had in a while .
the bread was soggy and the tomatoes tasted old .
i had the chicken quesadilla and it was very dry .
the salsa and guacamole were less than fresh .
this place was terrible .
food was typical and gross nothing to write home about .
food and menu selection was minimal and nothing sounded or looked good .
i can only imagine the conditions in the kitchen .
as a former restaurant employee ... completely unacceptable .
i wish i could give this place a higher rating .
i mean ... absolutely terrible .
went downhill fast , service and food below average .
unfortunately i ca n't recommend .
i 've been to bar louie countless times because i work in the area .
it was very loud .
the tortilla soup was pretty tasty , but not worth the price .
drinks were extremely expensive for what you got .
my sangria was $ _num_ and was very watered down .
the same glass at most other bars would have been half the price .
horrible !
take your hard earned $ $ elsewhere .
this place is the worst in pittsburgh .
soda watered down martinis for _num_ bucks yay !
Neutral
negative two stars !
overlooked fish in the tacos , just blah .
no on even looked our way .
zero stars .
and then you wait ... and wait ... and wait for a server .
they are usually rushed and your order is often incorrect .
last night my toppings were wrong and my guest got the wrong sauce .
but it 's not this once -- it 's always like this .
service was terrible .
food absolutely sucked and took over _num_ minutes to come .
the place was empty and i see why .
bathroom was disgusting .
i wo n't return here unless forced to .
first problem : place was empty and steelers were playing .
first martini took a little under a half hour to get to me .
but yay for yummy pretzel dips ?
i order another martini and wonder why i bothered .
how bad can it be ?
unfortunately , spending a ton of money on endless martinis did n't happen .
_num_ was enough waiting .
just got a beer taken off bill .
what a mess !
should have ordered the over priced not cold enough beer .
the wait staff and kitchen are not remotely prepared for a normal evening .
they are rude , slow and simply incompetent .
probably because it 's not even managed .
glad we wasted our evening waiting _num_ hours for an appetizer .
horrible management .
drinks will take you _num_ minutes .
servers are clueless .
no stars !
worst dining experience of my life .
needs a complete overhaul or it wo n't make it much longer .
if i could give no stars i would .
went inside again _num_ minutes and was told the same thing .
_num_ minutes later a server finally came .
`` it was confusion about who was assigned to the table . ''
highly disappointed !
we stopped in for a 4th of july dinner and were not pleased .
we then notified a nearby waitress , and no one came .
i have been taking my _num_ animals here for years .
never experienced anything this rude ever .
this salon is small which usually is a plus .
the service was slow and way over priced .
for $ _num_ i expect a manicure along with gel polish .
too bad .
nice people , but quality is terrible .
the lady rushed my nails .
nurse supervisor had very little people skills and no compassion for patients .
unfortunate to say the least .
terrible customer service .
they wo n't be getting my money again .
once again you guys are wrong .
it was a little ridiculous .
difficult to find a sales associate when needed .
cashier was confused and took 15-20 minutes to ring my items up .
lines are always slow and long .
if i could give zero stars i would .
avoid if possible .
Negative
overall bad management .
no wonder they keep losing business to wal-mart and target .
never purchase a gift card from toys r us !
one of the most terrible store / customer service experience we had .
pathetic service !
no value for money !
i did my shopping online for christmas .
they were listed on the packing slip that the items were not .
i was told _num_ _num_ business days .
i guess the regulars know this , but a sign would have been nice .
the steak was ok , but the gravy tasted canned .
the okra was a big disappointment .
i was n't annoyed by this until it lasted more than _num_ minutes .
simply put , the standards have gone down !
place is dirty and management has given up .
prices are low and should be !
i got as sick as i 've ever been from this nasty place .
the wait staff are straight from the trailer park .
food is disgusting at best .
no luck there !
another _num_ minutes passed before our drinks were brought out to us .
cheap .
bland .
if you want it cheap and fast this is your place .
unfortunately what i experienced tonight can not wait to be said .
tonight s and i wanted to grab something quick , local and italian .
we were wrong .
wrong again .
we walked in , no greeting , sat down and waited for a menu .
the tables were not very clean .
my salad came out with my entree , chicken parmesan ( fool proof right ?
it was stone cold .
spaghetti was way overcooked .
i mean , it tasted awful .
we will not be returning to this location ever again after our experience today .
that was a big mistake !
you could see where the breast was cut in half .
they really do not even deserve one star !
we left & no one saw us leave !
our main concern was the very poor quality of the food .
this was bad pork .
it was very poorly pulled .
all fat and grease .
the color was gray and the texture was slimy .
i arrived to customers standing outside the door , after waiting for _num_ minutes .
i sat there for _num_ minutes before getting up to leave .
i am being generous when i give _num_ star .
we ordered two entrees , _num_ turkey dinner and _num_ beef brisket dinner .
not very helpful at all .
way over priced for sub-par food .
hands down the worst bbq and food for that matter in concord .
one bite of the sandwich and i was done .
pasta salad was hard .
and the waitress i had want too good .
they were the only thing that was good the cornbread was cold .
took over half an hour to get our food .
the restaurant was less than half full .
when the food finally came out our pulled chicken was ice cold .
restrooms were pretty messy .
the beans , again , were sub-par .
very personable staff , but slow .
not good .
neither of us were happy and will not be back .
stopped into hooters to get some wings tonight in concord .
( i have not been to a hooters in almost _num_ years ) .
the wings i just ate where close to the worst i 've ever had .
and finally , they were not very tasty .
disappointed is an understatement .
$ _num_ down the drain .
chicken cooked at wrong temperature ... was completely red .
threw up for 3-4 straight days .
lost business over it too .
fix the kitchen , fix the restaurant ... stay away !
the fries were cold .
this is too bad - since hooters has nothing else going for them .
i miss the old hooters !
i will never ever go to this hooters again .
wings are n't that hard to make !
only received one star because i have to leave one to write a review .
i then got up and left and will not be back .
out of town on business and had a craving for wings .
man was i disappointed !
i ordered fries 5-10 mins within getting my wings .
she presented me with my check and i paid and left .
i probably wo n't go back to another hooters for another year or so .
i sure do hope amanda c was just having an off day .
consider yourself warned .
if you want it spicy , then this is probably your place .
hahaha , this place is laughable .
there is no thought what so ever in their menu items .
it gets old after the 1st bite .
literally , maybe even less .
it was very annoying .
it was just horrible service overall .
unfortunately , i went to sticky fingers before this place .
nasty !
disgusting .
i ca n't believe i even stepped in the doors .
unfortunately , this place was a disappointment after eating in louisiana !
we wanted to like this place , but had a horrible experience .
the pickles would have been ok , but they were mushy as well .
they both just tasted like chicken nuggets .
raw oysters poor ( shame on us ) , everything else lackluster .
went last night for dinner , unit was not very busy .
bread pudding was luke ward and mediocre at best .
stick to the stuff that 's been fried .
wo n't be back if i can help it .
they had to return to the table too many times .
very bland food .
bad service .
been here _num_ times and only once did i get great service .
other times , i 've come solo and sat at the bar .
could n't find a manager to complain so just left .
the corn on the cob is out of this world .
the portions are very large , a lot of food for the money .
nothing ( except the corn ) is what i would consider above average .
i never got a drink refill and she never even looked in my direction .
the staff here is just lazy .
mediocre at best .
same exact taste across the board , making it very bland .
in addition , my meal seemed _num_ % pre-made and microwaved .
not sure if it was or not , but that 's how it tasted .
it took at least _num_ minutes to get our food .
the fried pickles were heavily battered and super greasy .
the mixed veggies that came with my meal tasted like reheated frozen veggies .
why is it that every little tourist destination has a place that sells fudge ?
why are these two unlike any others in any other state ?
nasty just take a look at the picture and you will see .
both mine and the wife 's were awful .
the asparagus was way over cooked the the fish was very dry .
wife had a pasta dish and was very disappointed .
bottom line , go somewhere else while in the concord mills area .
unfortunately that was not the case .
our waitress did finally return to apologize for forgetting my plate .
not just burned but the entire bottom was absolutely black .
terrible food and worse service .
i hate that i tried some new chicken dish .
i doubt i will be back to any og anytime soon .
once in a while i get dragged into this fine establishment by the ear .
it was a major craving during my wife 's pregnancy .
i 'm not a fan .
not to mention the service blows more often than not .
if this is your thing then chow down .
the food was horrible i had the fettuccine alfredo , not good .
we have been to this location several times .
however , the food is always not been so great .
the food is usually lukewarm at best .
stale and overpriced .
however , there was a bad smell in the entire place .
the lunch offerings are limited and sub par .
the sangria is a rip off .
i left a good tip because service was flawless .
food was on par the only thing that was missing was service .
we were left waiting almost _num_ minutes just to get a drink order .
this lady was rude and never came by .
may come back may not .
wish i could do less than _num_ star .
i repeated myself 2-3 times and she said `` omg what ? ''
hahaha this is about par for the crap concord mills area ... .
not recommended .
we had the worst lunch here today from start to finish .
the food was not enjoyable either .
needless to say we wo n't be coming back to this olive garden .
i would rate it a _num_ if i could .
ate here last night and had the worst service ever !
the server , very short blonde hair was clueless and lacked people skills .
my daughter 's food was great , she had the cheese ravioli .
i wished i had gotten that dish as i got the meatball sub .
i was not able to eat the bread as it was very well done .
i would not get this sandwich again .
yeah i know steak at a seafood place strange right ?
i believe we spent more time waiting on things than we did eating .
i have never been treated like this from a chain restaurant .
never again ... ... ... .
lousy service .
everything on the plate was covered in greasy sauce .
the service was very slow , and the food took forever to come out .
i keep trying to give this place second chances but it never works out .
i always end up disappointed by the overpriced meals and the terrible service .
furthermore , i was very unhappy with the service and food .
i would recommend maybe another location or another restaurant .
the restaurant seemed nearly empty .
never say no to a customer !
restaurant is not the cleanest .
this chain of red lobster is very unprofessional .
since this was not my fault i was very upset .
she offered no help and quickly hung up .
should have gone to olive garden .
overall , i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone .
avoid this red lobster .
avoid this place at all costs .
often frequented by big groups celebrating a bday or some other social occasion .
cheap lobster will do that .
i realized they had tables but no servers yet .
maybe the waiters were scheduled for _num_ .
we only waited _num_ minutes .
on special was split crab leg dinner for $ _num_ .
dumb on my part .
as soon as i got near the bar , it hit me .
the nasty smell that tells you the bar is n't cleaned well .
stale , old beer smell !
disgusting .
i ordered lobster pizza and lobster bisque .
the pizza is ok , but the lobster bisque is awful .
crackers are stale ?
biscuits were barely room temperature if that .
dumb on my part .
as soon as i got near the bar , it hit me .
the nasty smell that tells you the bar is n't cleaned well .
stale , old beer smell !
disgusting .
i ordered lobster pizza and lobster bisque .
the pizza is ok , but the lobster bisque is awful .
crackers are stale ?
this one seems to be very crowded .
hardly any walking room .
did n't even bother shopping .
there 's no way you can be that busy at 10:30 in the morning .
never going to this location , learn some manners !
then today another 5:30 am call , he did not follow through .
seems this gm only cares about the bottom line not you vacation experience .
we immediately went back down to the front desk and requested a room change .
reason .
needless to say , we could n't leave .
i have never experienced such lack of customer service , and am terribly disappointed .
i would not recommend staying there ever .
i went through it all over again .
why would they know me ?
i am not affiliated with this group !
they said that i would hear back from them in _num_ hours .
this is complete bs .
it 's just not quite what it use to be .
no way !
why do n't you serve beer !
you 're losing out on so much business !
ok place for the kids birthday parties or group treats .
dirty , if your not busy clean your damn store .
your starbucks for crying out loud .
on the weekends , forget stopping here for coffee .
it will take you _num_ minutes to get through the drive through .
no greeting just total given .
fridays for several years , this time around , my opinion has not changed .
each time i 've gone , i felt like i was ripped off .
on this most recent trip , i still felt like i got ripped off .
the food was pitiful , and the price was outrageous for what i got .
mine looked nothing like it showed in the picture .
my total meal was over $ _num_ !
did n't stop by for a status either .
this is was my first time at this location .
they do n't know their product _num_ % though .
i think it has vegetables , maybe . ''
_num_ .
_num_ .
it was n't that good .
one end is completely over cooked while the other is slight pink .
i was really confused how this happened .
they also had a tomato and mozzarella salad .
it was horrible .
i remember the sizzling chicken and shrimp being tasty ; however not this visit .
we did n't know if someone was going to shoot or not .
he simply walked away .
i ordered the french dip with no onions .
of course it came out with onions but no horseradish sauce .
i probably should n't laugh at that .
the only bright spot was our server .
the service was extremely slow as they forgot one persons order .
i ordered pot stickers , corned beef sliders and french onion soup .
the sliders were ok , but the soup was dreadful .
if i could give zero stars i would .
the food was alright except for my sisters food .
the chicken was terrible .
it looked like yesterday 's chicken that had been reheated in the microwave .
this was terrible .
the wall against the table was crusty with old food .
not worth coming to .
she did n't even ask if we wanted any appetizers or anything .
it 's really the service at this location that is n't good .
we had to wait _num_ minutes before she even got around to us .
the mash was good , the chicken was better .
as it turns out pity is quite the kill joy .
( which she did n't ) then the service i was not impressed .
was not pleased !
i did n't even waste my time spending any money .
we has the absolute rudest server in all history .
ordered a steal and it tasted stale .
took _num_ and a half hours to eat !
the services was fine for a wednesday night but the food was meh .
the meat on both were over cooked and charred .
the flavor of the sicilian was bad .
rude host , more than _num_ tables open and told _num_ minute wait .
walked out and got right into a restaraunt that was busier .
horrible service .
worst service of any restaurant .
he made constant mistakes throughout the night and kept having us repeat information .
sorry , next time i 'll go to another location .
my second bad experience at a tgi fridays .
bad mistake .
the only think good about this place is their vanilla bean cheesecake .
i wo n't be coming back .
my second bad experience at a tgi fridays .
bad mistake .
the only think good about this place is their vanilla bean cheesecake .
i wo n't be coming back .
the rating says it all ; `` meh '' .
apparently i had to be buying the exact same pair to get the discount .
no big deal .
it is not my job to be knowledgable of your policies .
_num_ of the _num_ of us had to request new silverware .
well never had a salt lick described as a hamburger .
yes , another salt lick that could double as a hockey puck .
not to worry though the app 's were great .
i brought my wife , daughter and grand daughter here for dinner tonight .
my daughter and i ordered the same _num_ oz .
mine was undercooked ( more rare than medium ) and hers was overly fatty .
very disappointed .
the peppercorn seasoning ordered was non existent .
the server brought out beers and it was 2-3 inches not filled .
no shit !
it 's because you let it sit in the window too long .
there was only _num_ person sitting at the bar .
well ... i tried this restaurant again ... and again was disappointed .
after all , how can you mess up a hamburger steak ?
by the way ... nobody finished their meal .
i also had their chili , which was tasty , but not very warm .
the sam adams was ( once again ) cold and good tasting .
very disappointing .
i feel dissatisfied .
this steak , however , was just blah .
the margaritas were weak , there was a lot of sour mix in it .
now here 's the home run , our waitress was polite and patient .
at this point we were already ready to go .
i do n't care if my dinner will be free or not .
but the host was horrible !
then about _num_ minutes later she said follow me .
we will not be back !
we ate at the one in charlotte last night and many others .
tonight 's meal and serviced sucked , four of us all had horrible meals !
we usually have good experiences at texas roadhouse .
however , tonight was just not the case .
i ordered salmon , like usual , and it was only warm .
i sent it back and it came back dry and the bottom was burnt .
i am traveling through town and wanted to place a quick takeout order ... .
i would defiantly choose another restaurant !
well , we were wrong !
based on him alone , i would have given this place _num_ stars .
next year , we 'll skip this place and head to bojangles !
these cooks ca n't cook worth a crap !
the barbecue chicken was dry and grilled .
the meats on the choices could be better in taste .
umm wo n't be back .
i regret my steak choice .
they did n't do very well on my ribeye .
why is my review so harsh ?
this should n't happen .
the flavor was lacking - more butter or salt when you cook it .
longhorn steakhouse has shown they can do this steak better than texas roadhouse .
unlike last time i did n't sit there and take pictures of everything .
i was disappointed with my visit to this location last night .
after _num_ more minutes of waiting , we were seated .
we sat another _num_ minutes waiting on her to greet us .
no complaints .
we finished our meal and sat , and sat , and sat .
there were _num_ of us on a saturday night .
the service was slow .
he says $ _num_ .
so it does n't matter which steak i ordered .
so _num_ side is $ _num_ but not having _num_ sides is $ _num_ .
he refuses to discount it more .
i then explain in detail the horrible service we have had thus far .
i ordered a chicken salad sandwich which was fair at best .
i will not go back .
place was empty and food took awhile to come out .
we even walked out once after _num_ minutes of not even being brought drinks .
it is n't just _num_ waiter or _num_ cook .
a few of us went here on tuesday night to check things out .
the drink specials , _num_ pbr and _num_ high life made me laugh .
the nachos were inedible , soaked with sour cream and some sort of chili .
the service was extremely poor and the staff and management was rude .
i would n't go back .
also , the place was almost dead .
the service is very below par .
yes , the chicken is like a whole chicken in a giant bun .
the bun does not do this breast justice .
do not come here , especially if you are a female !
i finally walked out .
twin peaks was much better !
guess i did n't leave a big enough tip .
later we went in to watch the fight which was on the tvs inside .
just a sub par place .
the owners and managers must not eat there .
disappointing .
blonde bartender was obnoxious and rude .
then the hamburger made our s stomach hurt , my girlfriend even got sick .
horrible service , horrible service !
we went in and sat down for twenty minutes .
the place was n't even that crowded .
avoid this place !
good food but wait staff is mediocre at best .
would n't go back .
wait time was very long .
i ordered boneless wings and thing & chicken tender plate .
i have had _num_ poor experiences with this jared store at concord mills .
i walked out without buying anything .
i tried this jared because i was in the area .
completely different atmosphere than i 'm used to .
probably the worst nights sleep i have had .
on and off like the tank on the toilet bowl refilling .
ours did it and above or below was doing it as well .
i usually have better results and never have to worry .
unfortunately this stay was n't as pleasurable .
`` no '' that 's all anyone could say .
so i go down and sure enough .
i should 've saved my money and stayed in a budget motel .
it would 've been just as good .
terrible experience no customers service .
after this last time yesterday i wo n't be back .
what a disaster .
my second visit was for the ray lewis book signing .
and that too was a disaster .
thin walls .
... my room was clean and staff was efficient .
called the front desk and was told he would call me back .
well i ca n't sleep with that going on every _num_ seconds .
very inconvenient and annoying !
what hotel does n't keep the smoke alarm batteries changed on a regular schedule ?
went here with my people and it was just okay .
but at least it was n't on the border bad . '' )
the first thing we got was , of course , chips and salsa .
seriously , how can you screw up chips and salsa ?
i like guacamole , and my boyfriend 's addicted to the stuff .
after half a taco , i could n't do it .
the super fishy taste blended with way too much cabbage and some crappy sauce .
for probably the first time in my life , i declined .
the most surprising part : beer did n't make it better .
everything was way too salty and the waitress was terrible .
place not clean at all !
do n't come here if you really enjoy mexican food .
too bad the house salsa tastes like pace from a jar .
_num_ stars at best but not offensive .
it was never great but it has gotten worse .
food was just bad and overpriced .
tasted like zero effort went into making it .
tried it and they were out of everything we tried to order .
gave them another try and same thing .
had a terrible experience .
a waitress pointed to another table , which was clean .
the waitress was not at all friendly .
never came back to check on me .
when waiting to pay , the waitress caught my eye for the first time .
not a friendly little restaurant in my eyes !
atmosphere was weird .
i assume if you are a regular , you 're treated better .
however , i do n't know why you 'd want to become a regular .
should not recommend this place to anyone .
first of the place was so dirty , it looks they never clean .
i went in today to get chicken noodle soup from the salad bar .
the container was empty .
i only came to get _num_ new tire .
however , i do n't think i will be coming back .
i would rather pay more money and be treated like an important customer .
disappointing older hotel .
nothing was blatantly wrong here , but the room felt neglected .
it just needs a little attention .
i did not get that favorable impression of this one .
good rate , but there are much better values nearby .
the bathroom was gross .
the sink would n't stop dripping and the toilet would n't stop running .
we changed rooms to the one next door , which was moderately better .
so glad we left the hampton inn !
none of the workers told us what was going on .
wow !
one star only because you ca n't do zero stars .
worst dentist i have ever been to .
you could not pay me to go back !
my car was experiencing transmission problems and i was recommended to this business .
i had the car towed to carolina car care .
this is where things went badly .
when he came back , he kept asking more questions .
i have to admit at this point i got annoyed .
i mean , i had n't even seen the inside of the car yet .
this is where things got really bad .
thing was , i am planning to buy .
i have never been more embarrassed in my life .
cash in full , no trade in .
we will not buy the car without looking at it and driving it first .
so this is when things went really wrong .
no luck .
this is a terrible way to treat a potential customer .
_num_ .
tried the whole payment pricing ... i.e .
_num_ .
it was a complete waste of time for us to be in their lot .
do not go to this dealership !
purchased a car there last month and was treated horribly .
when i arrived and met ken all he wanted to see was the check .
it hurts but that 's why they make water !
i only buy the pizza if i have a coupon .
this is not new york pizza or pasta .
the pizza was very bad and bland , but edible if you are starving .
pasta was not edible at all .
restaurant was very cramped , even though it was empty .
very cheap and tacky looking .
the salad bar was ok as well but the dressings were horrible !
i tried the italian first and then ranch and both were bad .
the pasta did n't look appetizing so i did n't try it .
chicken parm and meatball are both a lot of food for the money .
only _num_ sauce choices for wings but you get a lot for the money .
before you even step inside the restaurant , it looks depressing and run down .
slowest bojangles i have ever been to .
after several visits for breakfast they continue to be slow .
everytime i order something there will be problems .
not just this time , the services are always bad .
they never seem interested in serving you .
so needless to say a quick drive through meal took almost _num_ minutes .
today , the service was excellent like always but the food was awful !
i found a place worse than mom 's .
food was kinda blah , not horrible but nothing fantastic .
limited choices and frankly ugly atmosphere .
overall , it 's just ok .
for this reason alone , i wo n't be going back .
food was awful !
no thanks ... .
there are so many this wrong with this place .
( _num_ adult and _num_ kids ) .
the skate sizes run a shoe size too big .
so moral of the story is do n't waste your time and money !
the place is a dump and the staff is rude and inconsiderate .
avoid this place like the plague ... because they have it there .
nothing new here .
looks like they have n't vacuumed in months .
the sitting edge around the rink is disgusting full of dust .
was not at all impressed by this place .
prices are reasonable but the music was downright horrible .
this place is poorly managed and has gone downhill .
my husband and i called them to get an estimate on a garage door .
then it took an additional _num_ months to get a half butt estimate .
they would not repair for free !
the worst pedicure ever !
absolutely horrible !
how do i get in contact with the owner of this salon .
i tried to give this place a second chance and never again .
this is the reason y'all are slow in the first place .
the service is ok at best .
last night i ordered _num_ sundaes .
no offer to remake my sundaes .
worst ever ... wait _num_ mins in an empty store .
the red head guy looked at us and walked away .
no hi hello nothing .
just rude .
half of the baskin robin ice cream was put away .
btw only 7pm .
red burrito menu is nasty though .
not the best choice .
unfortunately salt does not stick to cold fries .
the prices are cheap , but you are getting what you pay for .
no response , no return call .
i emailed them on facebook , no response .
when you call the office it is impossible to get a live person .
no used gear bought in .
much empty floor space .
really do n't get it .
wish i could say the same about the store .
if you want my business , stock your store .
so i went to go pickup my card and boy was that a hassle .
i finally get up to the register and get everything ran through .
( the lines at the registers are insanely long ! )
i 'm thinking why the hell would n't you tell someone this .
i 've never had any trouble there , buy in bulk , etc .
i do not like strangers in my personal space .
i do n't really spend a lot of money at costco .
when i was approached by an employee today , i politely declined the service .
)
cheap .
not much more to say .
had a really disappointing experience purchasing tires at costco matthews .
after this , they were better but still not right .
costco tire manager refused to do anything further .
my experience with this company has been horrible .
the operator told me to wait for a call from the technician .
so disappointed .
this company gives horrible customer service !
we took the first appointment , which was _num_ week away .
i got the one cheap hair cut they teach in barber school .
the one no one has asked for in the history of hair .
too many choices to have to put up with service this bad .
also there 's always a long wait these days .
zero stars !
this er is horrible !
Very negative
i 'd give it negative _num_ stars if i could .
it took _num_ and 1/2 hours before a doctor saw her .
that is ridiculous !
the staff was unfriendly , not helpful & just horrible .
do n't expect quality service .
i would give _num_ stars if possible .
no more .
this place has went down hill for the last several years .
so far they have rescheduled me _num_ times this year .
they schedule me of a _num_ or _num_ pm appointment .
i assure you , they do not care about the patient .
there are too many good doctors out there to waste your time here .
the appointment was scheduled for _num_ am .
i arrived two minutes late , checked in and sat down .
horrible , horrible experience .
( oven , fridge , dishwasher . )
but i ca n't eat here .
they rest of the food is really terrible .
the topping choices were okay , not great ( dill pickle chips ?
i passed on the soup as it did n't look appealing .
the `` hot '' food was all lukewarm and super gross looking .
look , i am totally a soup and salad girl .
wrong !
not really but you see my point .
i wo n't be back , at least not to this location .
perhaps i had my hopes up too high .
i went here for a quick bite as i had business in the neighborhood .
i must say , i would have done better anywhere else .
the salad selection was less than fresh to say the least .
this is where things get really depressing .
except it was n't !
the soups were just blah .
just all in all horrible .
what a waste of time and money .
this place is gross .
weird , but who does n't like pickles ?
bf ate his salad & whatever soup he had .
that place is nasty too .
ladies beware before coming here , matthews towing will rip you off !
the sub itself is pretty awesome .
mistake you can just make it 's not ok .
if i could zero stars , i would !
horrible & will never go there again !
i was told it would be a while , so i left my vehicle .
after around an hour or so , i called back to inquire .
i was told no , they are too thin .
ben then quoted me a rate near $ _num_ for this work .
again no , `` put my s @ !
blank stare again .
if i could give this location zero stars i would .
enough said , i will never step foot in this location again .
i did not have good experiences with either of them .
unfortunately my recent experiences have taken a turn for the worse .
this is inexcusable and absolutely terrible businesses practices .
it 's a little too crowded for my taste , though .
i am quite sad that this location closed .
bad decision , caribou corporate !
just this week we had a menu delivered to our home .
so we placed an order which before tax should total _num_ .
they bill me for _num_ .
( all before a $ _num_ off coupon ) .
no values and no line for tax added .
they are so bad with delivery orders .
this place as absolutely ridiculous when it comes to delivering food .
no i want it now i want what i ordered and paid for .
not even a free we are sorry egg roll .
i would give zero stars , but that was n't an option .
i probably wo n't be back just because its far from where i live .
sad but true , sorry .
pickled jalapenos that is - as hot as kosher pickles .
the waiter was embarrassed and rushed some sauteed jalapenos over to us .
terrible food and service and kinda pricy .
would not recommend .
worst salsa i have ever tasted .
the meatballs were so dense .
on top of that , they lacked any flavor .
the potatoes and the carrots were raw and so undercooked .
the only thing that was cooked correctly was the zucchini .
they serve raw vegetables in their soup ?
i ordered one shredded beef taco and one cheese enchilada .
it was a quesadilla with cheese smothered all over the outside .
there was no way i was feeding that to my son .
i think this restaurant uses the wrong cheese and too much of it .
it took forever to get water , then drinks , then refills .
this was our 2nd time here and we wo n't go back !
not the worst place but not the best either .
an extra $ _num_ was added to my purchase when i looked online .
not to mention bad business practice .
but here they put a very little amount of chicken .
much less than any other place i have been to .
very slow service !
it 's such a shame , because i do enjoy the food .
food came out and it was n't worth the wait !
their salsa is ok but a little bland .
i asked for soft tacos instead of hard shell and still got hard shell .
i got ground beef with my tacos and the meat was very greasy .
their food is mediocre and so is their service .
i 'm sorry .
it does n't taste right and our food was just funky .
additionally , the service was not very good .
i had flautas and they just were not great .
what mexican restaurant does n't give you chips and salsa ?
can not recommend .
fruit bowls were plentiful at the breakfast buffet .
no eggs available at the buffet .
no cookies served on the weekend .
beds were so uncomfortable , very hard .
luggage cart was extremely difficult to steer .
carpet in elevators was worn and needed to be replaced .
the rooms do not come with a fridge and microwave .
not able to change at this point .
this teeter should be called harris teeter junior .
my husband and i went there for wings .
wish we had n't .
when we got the wings , they were cold !
our bill was _num_ without tip .
we got wings , side salads , a water and a pepsi !
i do n't know how this place received any compliments or stars at all .
it 's sad you pay your hard earned money for nasty food .
this is not a deli .
this time i got chicken parm .
it was not chicken parm .
the chicken was not breaded .
the marinara was bland .
i wo n't be back .
this dick 's used to have excellent customer service .
terrible customer service at this location .
same issues , just piss poor .
same issues , just piss poor .
i hate verizon .
the manager is such a pathetic example of customer service .
the other options are just as bad .
typical poor service .
avoid this location !
so i stood there and watched some girl get torn a new one .
the manager then stopped to breathe in between yelling and noticed us standing there .
i understand maintenance but we were literally standing there about to start a game .
acting the whole time that we were not even there .
speaking of drinking beer , their bartender on saturdays doesnt come in until 5pm .
why do they make you feel like you are nuts to even ask ?
the staff is incredibly slow and disinterested .
a more updated arcade can make you a lot of money .
but not happy with the actually games .
not impressed enough to go back .
big mistake .
chicken burrito should have some chicken in it .
he made no other comment and walked away .
is one very good mexican restaurant within _num_ miles of my house .
often have to wait to get inside .
will not eat here again .
enchiladas were just ok nothing special .
not sure we would go back .
seriously one of the worst experiences i 've had in a restaurant .
expect no tip and definitely no smile from me .
its so obvious its rude .
chicken was without any flavor and super chewy .
the salsa tasted like shrimp cocktail sauce .
the chips were stale and greasy .
avoid this place .
do yourself a favor and eat at a crappy chain restaurant .
this was one of the worst experiences my friends and i have had .
we were seated quickly upon arrival , but the service sucked .
none of the other staff was friendly , either , except the hostess .
we will not be back .
did not get the drinks we ordered only water .
$ _num_ for a taco and water .
the service was ok they were attentive but there were only a few tables .
i ordered the linguine with lump crab in it and it was just boring .
also , there was barely any seafood in my dish .
so that you may now how far they have fallen .
it 's kind of sad really .
throwing in even a drop of balsamic would have overpowered it .
one down .
no dressing no nothing .
... and i 'm being generous .
seven dollars and change for the worst imitation of tiramisu i 've ever had .
however , this is the worst restaurant i have ever been to .
my order was brought out with the wrong side .
was told this would be fixed , never was !
one whole dollar was taken off our order !
food was average at best ... stay away from this location !
no drinks ?
they stared at me confused and pointed to the _num_ drinks .
he did n't bring bread or silver wear until we asked .
limp , room temperature , gross .
not typical of what i 'm use to from this chain .
this time it was fried too long .
wo n't give them another chance .
_num_ i did not order the nasty potatoes !
messy kitchen !
waited a really long time to be seated for a mediocre birthday dinner .
it just tasted bland to me .
just not my thing .
our experience was horrible when we picked up our food !
not undercooked , or rare , or cold ... completely freakin raw .
fortunately we caught it before we are it , so no one got sick .
talking with servers and other employees it seems to happen a lot lately .
i 'm just concerned that if i return i will have a similar experience .
i was told it was a _num_ minute wait .
all i got was _num_ spaghetti dinners and a pizza .
it was barely enough food to feed my _num_ year old daughter .
i know this is a chain restaurant but we were pretty disappointed .
does anyone know where kathy went ?
this starbucks is the worst i 've ever been to .
weak coffee and the staff is extremely slow with bad customer service .
i 've came here twice to get my gel manicure done .
it was so thick my nails looked fake .
well guess what my nails did n't make it to the second week .
will not go there again .
is dirt cheap compare to other places i been too .
i went to this nail salon for the first time and was very disappointed .
sanitation of equipment was dismal .
outdated and cluttered , but it 's a nail salon , not a spa .
the worst - my manicure did n't last _num_ hours .
i can not recommend this salon .
took _num_ hours total mid day saturday for a fill in manicure and polish !
gross !
walked in and all of the ladies looked as if i was bothering them .
maybe better luck next time !
mediocre food , inattentive staff , slow bar service .
waited too damn long .
and the manager was not apologetic about anything .
do n't blame the amount of guests in the house .
get more staff and cover the shift accordingly .
oh wait , i forget .
i 'm starting to hate that place .
ugh .
sorry , guys ... lost a star in my book .
i adore chinese food but this place is really unacceptable , not even mediocre .
awful chinese food .
the food is tasteless , service is crappy , restaurant is dirty .
do n't drive too far to get there .
one word sums up this place - yuck .
not even close .
after a while , she ends up yelling just as loud as him .
the dumplings are thick and doughy .
miss the old ownership , and wish there were other choices nearby .
they were sooo nice and the coffee was great , hash browns cold .
staff was super rude at this location .
i ca n't believe how often this is true .
how bad is it when you do n't want to go to target ?
others are just damn cranky .
the workers here are so rude !
do not go on your lunch break .
the parking lot here is awful .
this place was pretty busy for a weekday .
when it was time to checkout , the lines were pretty long .
not a fan .
they do n't make any effort to make things right or show they care .
i 'm beginning to get annoyed with target all together .
do not go to this location , it 's a waste .
the service is not quite that good .
he was arrogant to say the least and just short of rude .
terrible food .
i got the cheese enchilada with refried beans and rice along with a margarita .
the margaritas were horrible as well .
def would not recommend it to anyone .
not a place i 'll ever crave a meal from .
this place serves its purpose , i suppose ; it 's just nothing special .
not a place i 'll ever crave a meal from .
this place serves its purpose , i suppose ; it 's just nothing special .
horrible service and nasty little queen at the front .
this is not going to be a good review .
our visit was horrible .
the plate was a mess .
i did n't think factory food could taste that bad .
only gave one star because you ca n't give no stars .
they said the chicken tacos was n't an option .
obviously they do n't want my business .
no one , not even the manager , asked them to quiet down .
the people there are horrible !
there have been times i literally waited _num_ 1/2 hrs for my food .
the staff is snotty and managers do n't care .
i have waited so long the i just left without anything .
do n't waist your time or money !
my wife 's fries , accompanying her shrimp dinner , were stiff and unappetizing .
i do n't think i 've ever had a good experience here .
they either get my order wrong and/or the food is disgusting .
i got a burger was bland and needed seasoning .
i 'll review both trips to this terrible location .
first trip was a late night trip so expectations were low .
they also messed up my entre and we had the same problem with refills .
food was poorly prepared .
too hot and then other items cold .
i had n't been to a applebee 's for a few years .
i should have worried .
wendy 's would have been a better option for the beef .
it was pretty bad .
this was the 2nd time this happened in two days at two different establishments .
having hot sauce on each table is a definite plus .
wo n't be going back .
am i missing something ?
that 's why i ask you to please tell me what i 'm missing .
is there a secret menu i do n't know about ?
am i visiting at the wrong time ?
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
i immediately grabbed my purse and stood up .
the only thing nice about this place was our waitress .
will never go back though .
very poor service .
it was 6pm and the place was almost empty .
tyler told him he would wipe it down when he was done .
there 's no telling what you might find on or in your food .
horrible experience .
that was about the only positive thing about my experience .
she stared me down almost in awe that i did n't want any .
i 'm sorry but i did n't know .
the food itself was complete garbage .
Negative
overall a pretty negative experience .
i hate this location .
service is bad .
even the manager does n't care .
the menu had maybe _num_ items .
i did n't eat but half of it .
also , it was pricey for what you got .
this place is n't that great .
very rude and the main reason for the one star .
we were so disappointed .
i was told that the gnocchi would be made with spinach instead of pumpkin .
it was barely edible .
my husband chose the special : scallops over risotto with vegetables at $ _num_ .
again , barely edible , uninspired and boring .
they just want to sell you the overpriced , outdated merchandise in stock .
ate here with a $ _num_ gift card from my boyfriends work .
we did n't come with any high expectations , other than a free meal .
the salad was boring and small and overpriced , but it was edible .
ugh .
i will not be returning to this location .
wrong .
i waited for _num_ minutes .
that i do n't like .
( f $ & # ! )
the family member i was with is all about discounts , coupons , etc .
bread was brought , it was meh .
i am not spending all night going around and around about $ _num_ .
not enough of sauce , wrong butter , and gave me the wrong shrimp .
outback will never be your best meal .
kinda the same effect i feel after eating at mickey d 's .
generic , overly salted and way overpriced .
the bad news is that the inside has n't changed much .
that is n't good .
also the blooming onion has lost it 's luster .
it 's oily and nasty .
the outback needs to be out back .
worst outback i 've been to .
the service sucks and there food is not good .
very ran down so do n't waist your time and money at this location .
our waitress was promptly attentive .
this location sucks .
no service ... no stars .
from the moment we walked in , the crowd was an odd mix .
the hostess staff seemed confused and clueless .
no one spoke to us .
there must have been _num_ families with kids under _num_ after _num_ pm .
he was annoyed and wanted us out !
just a bad experience and a very rude manager !
so i guess it 's ok then , right !
my husbands salad was thrown together and my clam chowder was cold .
charlotte native here .
this outback is not worth your time or money .
you 'll get a better burger at a sports bar .
saturday call ahead seating for party of _num_ at 1:30 .
replacement steak sandwich while tasteless was better but the damage was already done !
mediocre service .
took forever to get food out , more like _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
food is ok , nothing to go back for .
really _num_ on a sunday no servers _num_ times in a row .
terrible service .
this place is just sad .
after _num_ mins or so the onion came out and we dug in .
filet mignon was like a hockey puck .
horrible service .
noticed several people were sending steaks back .
do n't know how an outback can be this bad .
$ _num_ bucks wasted !
too many steak houses to choose from .
every time i go there i wait much longer than they tell me .
mine took almost _num_ hours .
i know that the tire rotation does n't take more than _num_ minutes .
no apology was offered for the long wait .
what they charge for labor is absolutely ridiculous .
almost $ _num_ of my bill was labor .
probably wo n't go back again .
long story short , he gave me the keys to the wrong car .
my overall impression was that this is not a very professional outfit .
the problem has been after the sale .
therefore i am unable to get tags or get the vehicle inspected .
i called again after _num_ weeks , and was given a similar answer .
i probably should have known better .
the pizza is terrible though .
the cheese even has kind of an artificial taste like it 's processed cheese .
what they had was basically watered down pizza sauce to pour over your macaroni .
worse than little caesars .
you can even hear them laughing afterwards trying to entertain themselves .
oh wait , most of them are over _num_ .
wow , how pathetic .
they lost _num_ stars on being highly obnoxious alone .
every time we have been here we have been disappointed .
no more chances .
you really pay $ _num_ to eat crusty pizza dough with sauce on it .
brownies should n't be the only dessert option on a saturday afternoon also .
the owner needs to change management or just shut this place down .
flavorless pizza , full of grease & tasteless crust .
i will not shop at this store again .
every department seems to be : how should i put it `` lazy '' .
today we brought four out-of-town guests by for a late lunch .
i discovered i was not given shrimp at all .
utterly disgusting !
she acknowledged the pest problem and said it was due to construction out back .
hard to believe this restaurant is still open .
i do not recommend this restaurant at all .
i do n't understand why i could n't simply be put in a list .
well only at their convenience , not the customer .
just fine - not good , but the food was terrible .
at any rate , i sent it back to be cooked .
i had n't eaten 1/4 of it when i asked for a box .
that was honestly the most poorly prepared steak i have ever eaten .
it was absolutely terrible .
granted , i do n't eat steak often , but it was seriously bad .
my boyfriend was very disappointed in his dish as well .
the food was awful .
i am terribly disappointed and will not be returning to this location again .
they did n't take the meal off the bill .
no , we wo n't come back .
not good !
the quality of food at this location has gone down over the years .
the appetizers are smaller for the same price .
the food is served very bland or overpriced .
not worth the money anymore .
the atmosphere was great and the wait staff was very accommodating .
before we completed our meal , we were being pushed to order deserts .
instead of a long drawn out story , i 'll just make a list .
i guess # _num_ is the worst .
do not get the trout !
she had _num_ bones in one bite .
they quickly took that plate away .
i could n't have been more pleased after our first in august .
we returned this month to a totally different experience .
i asked for a refund and she refused while laughing at me .
she claims our dogs are n't used to bring groomed which is false .
i 'm furious and will never return .
why on earth would i return ?
in the four years i 've had him this had never occurred before .
it took me by complete surprise .
otherwise i would have chosen another lunch spot .
both lacking in appearance as well as substance .
i have money i could donate but would never donate here .
terrible .
the gel is very uneven and i 'm super disappointed .
wo n't be back for another try .
this place is nasty .
if i could i would give this place no stars i would .
his male vet tech is horrible !
we had the worst experience with this place !
i just want to pick up my husband suits .
i would have preferred to have lower cost and just had an oil change .
i wo n't be back .
and jiffy is no longer a good deal .
even with a coupon it cost $ _num_ .
not so anymore .
way too expensive for the quality .
$ _num_ just got me a sub ... no chips no drink !
the staff was friendly though !
so ... if you do n't mind paying that much for a mediocre sub .
i will not be back !
three minutes into the trim , he was done .
no stars for this place .
she does not give a receipt for inventory dropped off .
do n't know how she stays in business !
wo n't be taking any more items to this place .
bottom line , the food was tasteless and terrible .
mine went in the trash .
all the fish was overcooked and dry .
the hush puppies were tough doughy and tasteless .
this new restaurant falls way short on just about everything .
the fried clams were doughy and limp .
the cajun beans were n't bad though .
its just not my thing .
$ _num_ wasted .
so yeah ... the chicken tender meal i got was not great .
terrible .
i 'm extremely disappointed that they were not .
this place was a disaster during today 's _num_ % off sale .
worse than marshall 's during christmas .
this old navy was a disaster .
horrible store , understaffed .
clothes were thrown all over the floors in every department i walked in .
this place is a rip off !
not sure how they stay in business with the crazy prices they charge .
$ _num_ lunch with no service .
but twice now , i 've sat outside at lunch and been basically ignored .
do n't like that .
i 'm pretty big , and i only ate half of it .
i had long since finished my drink , never got a refill .
i asked for a box , and that took another ten minutes .
which is a shame , because the pizza tasted great .
all three times i 've been there it was almost empty .
it 's a shame the service is so bad .
the first time i went to mario 's it was dismal .
the alfredo sauce was broken .
the shrimp parmesan was literally boiled shrimp with seasoned canned tomato sauce and mozzarella .
let me tell you it 's not , and it 's very over priced .
i 'm not sure if that 's enough to bring me back though .
not cool , it 's not the same and you can taste the difference .
will not be back .
this place is a waste of your time and money .
the host seemed offended when we inquired about a kids menu .
the server was borderline rude .
expensive for food that taste like nothing .
the shrimps taste cheap .
new location not an improvement .
nothing special , overcooked shrimp and barely there clams .
the scallops were cooked well , but the calamari was rubbery .
the meal for both of us including one cocktail was nearly _num_ $ too .
high prices , bad service .
sorry mario 's i really wanted to like this meal , but no joy .
we were very disappointed with the new location .
but tonight , we felt like it was no longer a place for kids .
the kids menu is no longer printed .
parm cheese , red pepper , pizza stands were all gone from the tables .
less tv 's ( only noticed one ) .
service was very poor tonight .
i 'm used to dave stopping by to check on us .
the window shades did not provide any shade from the setting sun .
it is the only good thing i can say for the place right now .
the food was ok , but there was no kids menu .
you can cook spaghetti noodles for a whole family for $ _num_ !
we felt totally ripped off and will not be returning .
food is cheap .
went to visit with a deal saver coupon refused to accept .
told me i should call the owner if i did n't like it .
not worth your time if you see a deal from these people skip it .
this place is so forgettable , it 's almost funny .
my boyfriend ( now fiance ) and i probably ate here in _num_ .
the only thing i can remember eating were onion rings .
but when we walked in , we honestly did n't feel welcome .
i think he felt so uncomfortable being there .
i brought in my daughter 's old clothes , mostly _num_ 's .
they bought _num_ pairs of pants , and a dress for $ _num_ .
if i could choose zero stars i would !
was told to come back in _num_ minutes , came back in an hour .
was told to come back in _num_ minutes , came back in _num_ minutes .
so i shopped around a little bit .
so i approached the counter and said i 'll just take my stuff back .
unbelievable .
not worth my time .
i would not recommend this to anyone .
they asked me to come back once they could go through the bags .
after waiting in line for nearly _num_ minutes i walk up to the counter .
do n't get me wrong : i get it .
then i got new rotors , same issue a month later .
my biggest complaint is that customer service is seriously lacking at this location .
pro tip ... you do n't have to be a member to shop here .
here for a tire repair under road hazard warranty .
wo n't make the mistake of buying tires here again .
go firestone auto care center instead .
store is just not that busy .
i 'm over the days of customer no service .
sure enough it had expired _num_ weeks prior .
worst sam 's club ever !
not quite bojangles or kfc !
terrible service .
as for sauce , i got one honey roasted barbecue packet .
if that sounds like fun , check kohl 's out .
if that sounds like a nightmare , skip it .
there is always a sale and they often run kohl 's cash promotions .
my biggest complaints are the lack of organization and the often inventory .
but not when i get it from this particular store .
broken video games , old dusty house plants , peeling paint .
are they kidding me .
not to mention is n't that what they are doing !
horrible , horrible , and horrible .
i have never been so disappointed in my fellow yelpers .
this place is a dive bar and certainly no place to get food .
this place is basically a rundown shack that is pretty scary to walk into .
however , by the next day our stomachs were feeling pretty horrible .
good price , but sloppy work and they cut me .
besides the food the service was n't good .
the whole experience was very unprofessional .
i would give it zero stars if i could .
this is the worst pizza ever .
nope , just as awful as the other 3-4 times .
their wings are not good either .
horrible !
got sick twice .
buffet nothing to get real excited about .
_num_ seconds later she comes back and asks what i 'll be having .
i said why does sauce count as a premium topping ?
i do n't really know what to think about world market .
at world market , there is almost nothing that i can ever see using .
terrible service .
quiet could n't even hear here .
i can not believe the experience i just had here !
just horrible .
only gave one star because `` _num_ stars '' is n't an option .
_num_ for the donuts _num_ for service .
apple fritters ... none .
gone are the days of employees that care .
only really go here if i need something right away .
the technician was rough and the end product was highly uneven .
i do not recommend .
this is my first time coming here , and i will never come again .
very disappointed .
that said , i did not care so much for my meal .
the outside of the burger was cooked but the inside was almost too rare .
the desert consisted of two peanut butter cookies and a blonde brownie .
i have in san diego but not this one .
not good either .
that was $ _num_ for both , no soda .
for that reason alone , i would n't ever return .
the worst burger i have ever tasted in my life .
very dry and tasteless .
dirty tables , chairs and overall cleanliness of this restaurant was simply unacceptable .
just sad and flavorless .
no way .
it was terrible , terrible , terrible .
the end result looked like she just threw up all over it .
it was one of the most terrible sunday breakfasts i 've ever had .
the chicken was fatty with a nasty seasoning .
food was n't good either .
sorry q , you wo n't be seeing us for a long time .
my daughter and i went to this qdoba for lunch several months ago .
almost fell in this woman 's food .
i 'm never coming back here to throw my money away .
nothing to write home about .
it 's just like any other gift shop full of adorable little things .
everything else was definitely not good .
the fruit was old and actually rotten looking .
needless to say we will not be back anytime soon .
management does not seem to care much .
they are a sorry excuse for a business !
take your money and go elsewhere !
just because they say they 'll have it , does n't mean they will .
one situation waste your time and the other cost you money .
it is really a bad experience .
on the services side , expensive and not reliable .
i would stay away from this place .
total incompetence .
the salesman that set up the sale was totally incompetent .
my bike had to be ordered , so there was a wait involved .
he never called and updated me like he said he would .
i waited a total of _num_ weeks when they promised _num_ .
the day i picked up my bike was an ordeal .
instead they made me feel like i was the problem throughout the entire sale .
when he did show up he told me it will be done by saturday .
i called sunday and he never returned my call .
so pretty much my time was wasted .
i feel like i paid $ _num_ for nothing .
i would n't recommend .
stop begging for tips it 's tacky .
when jack is back i 'll give 'em _num_ , yo !
if they pick up a single malt i 'll give 'em _num_ .
it 's a dark , open space to watch your favorite sports team .
typical bar food , but skip the nachos ( the chips were stale ) .
one of the stalls does not lock .
overall experience , not too bad , not too memorable .
not your friendly local owned business .
this was neither .
i ordered a beef dish that i always use to test a thai restaurant .
the meat was overcooked and that sauce was bland .
i will not be returning , though i will say service was very good .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
that was thai chef over on international drive .
no one has come close to his cooking since they left charlotte .
some of the worst thai i 've had in charlotte .
which is sad , i really wanted to like it .
i really want to like thai taste since its so close to home .
so this time i ordered shrimp fried rice and tom kha soup .
same with the fried rice , it lacked flavor .
the food was ok , but not worth a return trip .
i 'm used to thai tea that 's almost like a dessert .
it 's americanized , `` in the style of '' , thai food .
now i 'm not here to say that the food i ate was bad .
you will not find it here .
unfortunately we were completely underwhelmed .
pad thai should not be sweet .
i left disappointed with a sticky sweet taste in my mouth .
i mean , the food just tastes okay .
i think it 's kind of pricey , too , for what you get .
_num_ ) they serve canned sodas , instead of fountain .
disgusting !
the smell i can only compare to that of an elephant .
but , the cabbage was grey and the taste was nasty .
i ate a few bites and threw it away .
why did n't i contact the restaurant about this ?
i was a much nicer person back then , i suppose .
but , obviously if i 'm writing this _num_ years later something was wrong .
not great but good .
i have been charged ( thank you online banking ) but no food .
soon would have been at 8:30 , only an hour after i ordered it .
takeout for $ _num_ for pad thai and green curry dish .
there 's no decent kabobs , chinese , thai or indian here .
guess i was spoiled living in northern va .
i had this for take out earlier in the week and was really disappointed .
this place has potential but did not deliver during my first experience .
the service was not overly friendly , but oh well .
the pad thai , not so much .
also , prices were not cheap .
it did n't taste good .
the sauce was too much and too sweet .
in fact it tasted like the sweet and sour dipping sauce with chili added .
there are much better places to eat thai food in charlotte .
this is very mediocre thai food .
do n't waste your time .
the pad thai tasted very americanized .
it tasted like sweet and sour .
was super disappointed , sad , upset that i wasted calories on this meal .
the chicken looked poor in quality and it had an odd smell .
i will not order take out again ; first & last time for me !
i was told it would be an hour wait , which was completely fine !
big portion of chicken , veggies , rice , and red curry sauce .
the pad thai was very much lacking .
with tip and delivery fee , our total was about $ _num_ or so .
worst service .
the waiters were rude and completely terrible .
they are rude and honestly make you feel like very uncomfortable .
worst thai restaurant i have ever been to !
the food was not fresh and the employees were not friendly .
if i could give this place _num_ stars i would .
i did n't pack lunch for my first day of rotation .
food is n't good enough to exist in its own .
the food has so much msg it 's too much .
it was water with msg ... tasteless .
the staff was n't that nice either .
buying one thing and getting another ?
so everyone stop patronizing this establishment .
now it 's mediocre at best .
the beer specials used to be good but now you get plastic cups .
we walked inside first so we saw that it was n't very crowded .
he told her that we were n't upset , she was just drunk .
he just had a very bad attitude and was completely unprofessional .
it was a terrible experience .
and the food was n't that good either .
this use to be one of my favorite places .
boy what a disappointment .
the service was very lacking .
terrible service with a brain like walmart people will always come in !
ugh .
the wings are disgusting .
not the best tasting oysters but good but covered the craving .
they all tasted like mud .
she stated that we could sit anywhere .
the menu is lame and tacky .
no the food and service sucks !
good drink specials but that does n't matter if you ca n't get one .
building is falling apart .
horrible experience with this company .
however , this company is very shady .
if i could give no stars i would .
no heat for four days .
the company was n't friendly , they were very rude .
they promised to fix stuff in my house and they never did it .
( i placed her in a home around the time of my move . )
the house was n't ready to be moved in .
i already rented through another company .
plus , i do n't like having my name online .
this is my only social media account .
so i ca n't understand why i was being charged .
my neighbor deserves the money that was taken out of my deposit .
not even five minutes later .
he got angry and raised his voice to me .
checked this place out back in the winter .
i just had a beer so i cant comment on the food .
but the atmosphere was yuck and the interior was just as bad .
there 's a entrance from the garage , so i walked in through there .
seemed like they were trying to go modern , but missed .
anyway , sat at the bar and grabbed a menu .
waited _num_ minutes and the fun imagination was turned into disappointing reality .
flavor was ok , but i 've tasted better .
not bad for $ _num_ out the door .
a huge roll was n't filled up , but what was there was good !
this place is my least favorite so far .
our waiter was not very attentive .
heavily battered and fried dry as a bone .
big mistake .
california style turkey burger : my son thought it was great actually .
cobb salad : large with lots of iceberg lettuce .
if you 're sober and hungry , think twice .
the food was terrible and the place was seemingly unclean .
their chicken philly steak made the list .
unfortunately , the sandwich did n't make my list .
at least not a good list .
not good at all .
it just was n't a pleasant experience .
we were starving so just walked down to this place .
honestly i do n't know why we stayed after seeing how filthy it was .
i came here with _num_ other people and everyone thought their food was awful !
food was so bad we did n't even want to take a to-go box .
do n't waste your money !
it 's also pretty inconsistent .
steer clear of the philly cheesesteak eggrolls or whatever the hell they 're called .
one of my friends ordered them and said they were unpleasant .
i ca n't put my finger on it .
also , never been a big fan of carpet in restaurants .
some of the waitstaff here will completely forget about your table .
the man serving me was very rude .
i tried to ask a question before ordering and he brushed me aside .
which had to be microwaved before served .
and that was only my first experience .
i doubt i will be returning there by choice .
so long as its nothing they actually make .
this place is disgusting .
unfortunately , i left quite disappointed .
first off , the place looks extremely outdated on the inside .
not to mention the prices are kind of high .
they told me their soup offering only comes in one size .
ordered the ruben number _num_ .
there goes half my lunch time .
slow service though .
very hit or miss .
so now i 'm out _num_ free washes .
horrible treatment at this car wash .
if any thing goes wrong they will not address .
needless to say i will never go near that place again .
i would give zero stars if i could .
i paid almost $ _num_ to wash my car .
service is not a priority .
this was probably the worst car wash i have ever been to .
they did not seem to care much .
i paid $ _num_ for the super .
car still had many dirty spots on it when done .
finally insult .
like erin said , not the place to go for a normal burger .
anyway , we ordered the chicken & shrimp satay for an appetizer .
the chicken was okay but tasted like it was from frozen .
overall , too much grease .
my last experience was probably just that .
the food is nothing special and the service seems to always be worse .
not sure the servers like walking up the stairs to the top dining area .
i really want to like _num_ east .
another ten minutes later he returned with my meal .
tough to cut or chew , and needless to say less than enjoyable .
not good at all .
they kindly accommodated this request ( made through a yelp reservation ) .
the whole grain belgian waffle was terribly bland .
not really sure why .
from what i hear _num_ east used to be a good restaurant .
not anymore .
tonight was the 4th time i 've been there in the past couple years .
the first _num_ trips were n't bad but definitely were n't good .
tonight was more along the lines of awful .
service : awful .
food : awful .
three of us got burgers and they were flavorless and over-cooked .
the crab cakes were eh .
nothing special really .
had brunch there today and the eggs on my benedict were overcooked .
i was hungry , so i ate part of it .
cheap .
entree we ordered crab cakes , a grass fed burger and mediterranean salad .
guac was blah .
the burger was overcooked , bland crab cakes and worst than average salad .
not very impressed , unfortunately .
my girlfriend 's pimento sandwich was decent but nothing special .
i visited this place on a friday .
everyone was waiting for a long time to get their food .
after about _num_ minutes of waiting , our dinner came .
unfortunately , i will not be back .
went to brunch on sunday , overall was very average .
we waited over _num_ minutes to get our meal .
breakfast potatoes are same as you get anywhere .
i really wish i could give this place more stars .
the place was packed so maybe this was just an off night .
our pimento cheese sandwiches were cold after we waited more than an hour .
that is beyond ridiculous .
after today , i wo n't be back .
despite this , my last visit was not pleasant .
given the price point for this dish , i expected quite a bit more .
two days later , i am still a bit bitter .
unfortunately , i was only in town for a weekend .
atmosphere : it 's in a house that 's been converted to a restaurant .
no complaints there .
it was bland as all get out !
i really wanted to like _num_ east , but maybe next time .
worst service in this restaurant in _num_ years .
there was a bread basket available with scones and muffins .
the eggs were horrible .
in fact , i could barely force myself to eat them .
i do n't know , but i 've never had scrambled eggs like that .
the potatoes were room temperature at best .
he said it was good , but probably would n't order it again .
overall , the food was a big disappointment .
the staff was n't very friendly and the servers were n't very accommodating .
wishing we had a better easter brunch .
gorgonzola stuffed filet was horrible .
bacon wrapped around it was not cooked .
filet so cold the butter on top would not melt .
hard to believe people return here after _num_ time to eat .
searching for decent mexican food in charlotte is like looking for big foot .
not an authentic mexican restaurant .
not good or great - fair .
i really do n't understand five stars for a mediocre burrito and brown guacamole .
but if you come here with low expectations you just might like it .
listen , this place has mediocre burritos and `` okay '' mexican food .
some spices would have been nice .
food is decent , service is mediocre .
do n't expect anyone to be too friendly or accommodating .
burritos are large , steak could use a little more seasoning .
but it was n't really worth the hunt .
tortillas are grilled rather than steamed , which i adore .
the burrito though was another utter disappointment .
the beans were al dente - hard .
the chicken was bland and dry .
every other bite was hard with a few burnt pieces .
mediocre imo .
oh well .
the salsa 's and guacamole ( sadly ) are very bland .
what is southwestern and/or mexican food without all the scrumptious sides ?
i still have n't found a good take out mexican with take-out prices ... .
i 've been up all night sick .
i repeat up all night sick !
that sadly just does not taste good in a burrito .
it tastes like what i 'd imagine hospital burritos would taste like .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i got a chicken burrito and she had a bean or veggie burrito .
the burritos were good but not fantastic .
_num_ .
neighborhood parking was hit or miss .
_num_ .
i do not understand how people give this anything more than _num_ stars .
it is awful .
there is no flavor to any of the ingredients .
oh the somewhat talked about queso ?
the guy at the counter is responsible for the second star .
needless to say , i was full .
i was n't very impressed with pb .
i tried it anyways but was grossed out by bite # _num_ .
_num_ get your food to go .
i 've had better burritos .
wo n't be going there anytime soon .
it should be called rice burrito .
here , i 'll save you the time and trouble .
go to qdoba or chipotle for a better burrito .
another guy was much friendlier to the patrons behind me .
the cons : the burrito was incredibly bland .
without that , it would 've tasted of nothing .
i was told sour cream was on the burrito .
it was not .
am i paying extra for the hipster atmosphere here ?
i can get a much better burrito at any of the mexican restaurants around .
parking sucks here .
the food has no flavor and was dry .
it 's also no cheaper than any of the other places around there .
went in for lunch today and had the bbq steak burrito .
i could n't even finish it because it was so dry and bland .
not impressed at all .
the steak queso burrito at qdoba is _num_ times better .
i could have made a better burrito at home and saved $ _num_ .
what a waste .
big thumbs down .
ended up with no chorizo and a bag of bland tortilla chips .
the queso was good but the burrito itself was average .
it had way more rice and beans then chicken .
this is definitely not my go-to mexican restaurant .
the chips are nasty and my burrito was very mediocre .
tried it for breakfast and it was just ok , nothing special .
i was still hungry afterwards .
the grits are just ok too .
it was just very bland !
worse , the salsa bar was n't available so it was very dry .
the food is n't especially good and certainly not memorable .
it borders on bland .
customer service was abysmal .
the restaurant , while never known for cleanliness , was even worse today .
very disappointed .
worst nail salon experience i 've ever had .
worst idea ever .
i have the gel all over the skin next to my nails .
also absurd , no credit cards accepted .
_num_ , c'mon .
whatever the reason , i felt ripped off .
the joke was on me though , for being such a sucker .
the key man building is shady as hell !
they have nothing better to do than to call the towing company .
horrible business practices !
they are crooks and should be ashamed on their shady business practices .
they did n't go home wth us .
which pissed us off .
the restaurant was only about 1/3 full at 12:30 pm on a wednesday .
it is definitely not handicapped accessible .
my chocolate cake dessert was okay - but not $ _num_ worth of okay .
our server does get points for assisting my companion with a wine selection .
- but the experience was really quite bad .
the place looks nice but the service is ridiculously slow .
food was ok but nothing special .
the hostess was very personable and accommodated us sitting near the window .
i guess to sum it up , i will not be going back .
not acceptable .
our server was very attentive and seemed to understand that we were frustrated .
quite the disappointment .
my fiance had the salmon served with spinach .
things started off looking nice .
it was n't very warm when i got it .
and the english muffin , that was kind of cold and ick too .
man was this an epic fail .
after being seated , we waited about _num_ minutes for anyone to acknowledge us .
that is not a solution .
did the chef even taste this before sending it out ?
my wife and i went with another couple for a birthday celebration .
after another _num_ minutes , _num_ of _num_ entrees arrived .
very disappointed with the service and food ; wine was reasonably priced .
was i disappointed .
price okay , service was cool , food was not good .
i would definitely not recommend getting this dish .
it was dry and lacking in flavor .
my boyfriend went with the beef tenderloin .
it was nothing to get stoked about .
nothing special that i could n't have made at home .
the restaurant was n't busy at all which made it all the more confusing .
after waiting nearly _num_ months , we thought to give it another shot .
this chicken was very garlicky .
not a fan .
low sanitation rating , dirty dishes , and no service .
waste my money .
the shrimp and grits were the worst i ever had .
the first time had it served with no sauce at all .
the french toast sticks were a little hard around the end crust .
do n't ever get the seafood risotto .
rude !
i see now why there was not wait right after work .
horrible experience !
staff does n't care if you live or die .
high prices along with the snobby staff , i wo n't be back .
slow slow slow !
it was the only one left with the perfect victoria fillet .
after about three bites i gave up .
i know times are tough , but a fillet from outback should n't be .
the meal which helped a little but it still ruined the whole evening !
the waitress was not nice !
arrived and was charged $ _num_ , which i questioned .
there are too many other restaurants , with better food and equal prices .
let me start by saying , i have always been an outback steakhouse fan !
like things have not been cleaned properly .
each time i have come here , my baked potato is undercooked !
lastly , it is a wednesday night and this place is empty ?
sad , again because i 'm a fan !
this outback needs a total overhaul !
that is a recipe for a failed restaurant !
unfortunately that 's about all that 's been good .
waited over _num_ minutes for refills and no bread came out .
when it did , it was _num_ small loaf for _num_ people .
_num_ minutes later ... .
shrimp was room temperature , all steaks were rare , ordered medium rare .
the pico di gallo was weak .
they did include avocado , but that 's all she could taste .
rough day for outback , clearly .
management is the only thing that will bring us back .
she resolved our very poor experience to my satisfaction .
ok , here goes .
is to blame for hiring the lousy staff .
yes , my review for outback has only gotten worse .
this past visit brought my review to a _num_ star rating .
sirloin and grilled lobster and a fully loaded baked potato .
very disappointing .
i guess the price should tell me what to expect .
stop putting ads that pop up like a highly rated restaurant .
the boyfriend sat down at the bar immediately and i ran to the facilities .
this does n't look weird to you ?
better late than never , i guess .
two of them sat next to us dirty the entire time .
what the hell , dude ?
it was burnt as hell .
which makes no sense .
if you knew they were that bad , why would you plate them ?
next time we feel like some outback , we 'll just go to longhorn .
she did apologize and take full responsible for the long wait .
our waiter austin was inconsistent .
bad service .
but this location is bad , and poorly managed .
and it 's $ _num_ .
this is probably the worst outback in the country .
this outback is the worse place i have ever been to .
i would rate this place with zero stars but that is not an option .
for this reason this has been the worse experience at a restaurant for me .
i would n't know about the food because we never received any service .
will not be returning .
worst meal i 've ever had and i did n't even get my entree .
that does not fix cars !
bring a gas mask or just avoid at all cost .
the shell at park and scott is so much nicer .
but then i 'm into that kind of thing .
he was very apologetic and very professional .
i am still so hungry it hurt !
i really really wanted to enjoy it ... but it was just disappointing .
the worst part of it all , though , was the service .
i found them very dry and a bit bland .
but for the money , there 's many better options in town .
however , a guest does not pay money for potential .
the best part of the meal was the duck egg rolls , amazing .
someone , besides our waiter brought our meal and mixed up the dish setting .
i never saw my waiter again after he took our order .
however , the manager walked around and never greeted the guests or inquired .
it was not rock salt , i can tell the difference .
besides , rock salt would not cut my gum . '
john told me it would take _num_ hours to process .
a week later , still no refund was processed .
the entrees are the worse in the city .
please do n't waste your money .
steaks are the worse .
their deep fried lobster tail is a joke .
not worth mentioning the rest .
the chef needs to go back to culinary school .
pretty place but food was very disappointing .
one of the worst restaurants on charlotte .
there just was n't anything innovative or superior about the menu .
but then again , what a great problem to have .
sorry , i disagree .
it was thursday night and only a hand full of people in the place .
( sad ) .
but the service was horrible .
they only served about _num_ spoons of cauliflower .
i do n't care how fancy you want to look like .
the waiter was applebees material .
this is poor marketing and bad management .
in conclusion , we would not go back even with a free coupon .
no dresses for the ladies , just jeans for them too .
the cat fish was too spicy .
the salad was too small for $ _num_ .
so , yes , i did have high expectations .
it was n't worth it .
maybe it 's because it 's restaurant week .
but that 's not a good excuse .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
shame on you !
my wife and i invited some friends to join us during resturant week .
the entrees looked more like an appetizers .
the desert was a joke .
the service was terrible .
either the broth was cold or the lobster was cold .
unfortunately my experience will not have me going back for more .
it would have been helpful to have some suggestions .
unfortunately the mousse was not very good at all .
our party of four was sat upstairs .
our waiter was not rude , but really was n't present either .
it was dry and had little flavor .
the desserts were decent , though not overwhelmingly good .
and , the lamb rib appetizer was all fat .
i 've never had a tough filet anywhere before , this was disappointing .
waitress a bit too much .
felt rushed and it was n't crowded at all !
wine and service were good , but could n't help feeling ripped off .
i have to knock a star off my previous review after my latest visit .
i then switched to the pizza buffet .
the food is not good at all .
i chose the creamy chicken .
this pizza joint offers a lunch buffet which i tried to have last week .
no buffet .
so i sat down to wait a bit .
after 10-15 minutes it was clear no buffet soon .
still no buffet .
two half eaten pizzas and about _num_ pieces of garlic bread .
very little seating in there .
i wo n't be back .
totally overpriced and not worth the money !
went there only bc it was recommended by a friend .
the second salesman ignored me completely as he was cutting keys for a customer .
that was my cue to leave .
sorry , little .
the food is mostly fine , but nothing to rave about .
no one would call me back after numerous phone messages and emails .
he says the fees are not currently going toward the neighborhood .
so now i am sick & pissed off from the treatment i have received .
this was unfortunately not the case here .
this place had made so difficult to adopt a puppy .
nasty .
threw the crap out asap !
horrible , horrible customer service .
called back , and he asked me if i was joking .
i ended up throwing it away after _num_ bites .
yet the service is slow .
grandma driving slow .
what they are all doing behind the counter , i 'm not quite sure .
that 's it .
but there are a couple that just do strange things with bagels .
i ventured out to einstein 's to try something different for breakfast .
disgusting !
the strawberries were old and nasty .
needless to say , i threw the fruit out .
however , the store itself is disgusting .
clearly management does not take pride in their work .
disappointing .
counters and tables have n't been wiped down in some time .
if this is a franchise einstein 's should pay a visit !
first time got home only _num_ .
_num_ asiago and _num_ pretzel how hard is that ?
bunch of idiots .
i ordered a lox on spinach florentine bagel without onion or tomato .
not toasted !
the grade at the location is _num_ health inspection .
i 'm really shocked and hurt !
really disappointed .
besides some patrons already seated the place was pretty empty .
the lady that took my order was extremely rude .
for the price it was not worth it .
i will not be back .
custom lost for life .
the bagels i got to go were hard as a rock .
considering the place is empty .
the wait staff , could careless about you .
very rude .
real bad all around .
you can leave it where it is ! ''
Neutral
if i could give this place negative stars , i would .
horribly rude company !
the whole situation was a shady shake down .
it was a saturday and very busy .
first of all , it 's nothing special .
not professional .
lock your damn door if you 're closed for the night !
worst customer service ever !
i 've spent hundreds of dollars here .
so , not sure why the reviews for this place are so good .
i will not be returning .
horrible experience .
the issue was the owner was rude .
wow i was very taken .
unpleasant experience .
i will not be coming back .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
i mean , really ?
and my nails look awful .
she just did a terrible job .
which sucks , because i do n't have that color at home .
no way .
you could n't pay me to go back .
for the price that this company charges , i was expecting more professionalism .
i would not recommend them to anyone i know .
when i actually ate my chicken i was more than disappointed .
the chicken was fairly dry and definitely nothing special .
unfortunately , i was n't very impressed .
i wanted to like the food- but i just did n't .
maybe i 'm spoiled by my moms southern fried chicken recipe .
additionally , it did n't sit well with my stomach .
not quite sure what all the hype is about .
chicken was decent .
paying for packets of hot sauce - seriously ?
it 's really the sides that disappoint at price 's , though .
the tots are bland and the coleslaw is no treat .
no bueno !
i immediately threw it away and have n't had the appetite to try again .
maybe it was a fluke , but that was really gross .
the only real edible item was the tater rounds .
the chicken had obviously been cooked earlier in the day & left to sit .
here at price 's you get it their way no exceptions .
the chicken was mostly old and cold .
i tried to speak to one that was not working and was completely ignored .
maybe it was just a bad day to go there .
this place is all hype .
the chicken is very crispy , but that is all .
there is no flavor and very bland .
i am from the south so i do n't mind grease .
man this sandwich was to greasy for me .
the first bite was hard like it had been over cooked .
had this chicken on more than one occasion .
it tastes like someone just threw flour on it and nothing else .
my problem with it was that it had no flavor .
that was really disappointing because everything else about it was good .
in addition , i was not impressed by the sides .
it was cold .
it was not crunchy .
it was pre cooked fried chicken .
and taste was nothing that would blow you away .
i just do n't get it .
luckily had a few dollars left over to help out my friend .
if only it tasted that way .
there was an odd taste to the chicken which was almost like soap .
the chicken first of all is way to bland , where is the flavor !
secondly , it tasted like it was probably left out for a while .
the chicken king right down the street from me is a much better choice .
i admit , expectations were high .
they have no seating .
it is a real dive ( and that 's not a bad thing ) .
the whole chicken fried was just ok , mildly seasoned , a bit greasy .
all and all the hype is much greater than the bite .
did not live up to the hype .
nothing unusual by any means .
wow not what i was hoping for .
my first ever experience was very short of the expected hype around this place .
Negative
very little meat very greasy .
not even the best fried chicken in charlotte .
sure , his chicken is actually not bad , but hear me out .
no exceptions , even for customers .
at price 's , they 're not bad , but not great either .
which kinda sums up the rest of my experience .
i lost .
i did n't mind the wait for this supposedly legendary fried chicken .
ordered a whole fried mixed pieces box and the iced tea too .
this is overpriced garbage .
threw it all away .
i 've had legendary fried chicken in charlotte before .
there were people sitting across the street in the grass , too .
so , the chicken was okay , but mine was a little dry .
i did n't like it at all .
we got chicken , fish and shrimp .
the hush puppies were so disappointing .
over cooking is the single cause of dry breast meat .
it 's okay but nothing to get excited about .
i think bojangles chicken is better in both taste and size .
nothing special as i thought it would be .
the chicken was very salty !
i was greatly disappointed .
the chicken was fried well but did n't taste up to the hype .
i was expecting amazingly flavored chicken fried to perfection .
it was completely void of flavor .
the only thing i could taste was salt and msg .
out of all the hood famous chicken spots this is the worst one .
i just ca n't believe this is the chicken spot that everyone talks about .
i was severely disappointed in the staff .
i 'm so torn about this place .
calling in orders is a joke .
i assume i just choose my cheese and the rest is just there .
no , you also have to choose your veggies .
they are not pleased when they have to say which veggies they have .
`` um ... i 'm not sure that we have any . ''
so ... should n't they always have it ?
confusing .
horrible customer service !
she was super defensive and unable to answer any of my questions .
it sucks because the few food items i 've had have been pretty tasty .
she had apparently already forgotten i was there at all .
went to get a smoothie and walked up to the bar .
the girl looked at me and never said anything to me .
i said i was standing over there but no one helped me .
so i went back to the bar and stood again .
so after a few minutes , i just walked out and left .
the guy basically told me to piss off and gave me my money back .
everyone was rude aside from the bar tender .
came here about _num_ months ago and had the worst experience ever .
ladies were free and the guys had to pay a $ _num_ cover .
as soon as we walked in it was dark and we saw no dancers .
the manager was n't having it !
no problem , i wo n't be back !
this is not a fucking strip club .
and they charge you $ _num_ for entry .
the worst place ever i have ever been to .
gross place , not attractive girls .
would n't visit again .
that 's not to say that it 's bad pizza .
i was all excited about fuel pizza being only a couple blocks away .
in a word : greasy .
veggie on whole wheat was loaded with peppers and mushrooms and more .
some of the absolute worst service i have ever ever experienced in my life .
this is n't fast food , if you ask me .
you do n't need to worry about it here .
that does n't bother me .
this location is terrible .
terrible atmosphere .
if it 's pizza you want , consider somewhere else .
if you want the best fuel pizza , consider a different location .
opted once for a calzone and it was not much better .
there 's much better pizza in charlotte .
this was an ok tasting pizza but ive had better .
i live near this fuel and have eaten here on many occasions .
the mediocre pizza is n't my complaint ( today ) .
it 's the terrible incident last night .
_num_ minutes after scheduled delivery i call them to check up .
i guess i should have called someone else .
no more fuel for me .
well , _num_ hour and _num_ minutes later , our food showed up .
the second one also had rotten lettuce ... third times the charm .
this meal cost me almost $ _num_ .
wo n't be going back .
)
, so be sure to be ready to spend that money .
however , if you 're looking for authentic nyc pizza , stay away .
my first visit to this fuel pizza was very disappointing .
i had never visited this one before .
i looked for a sanitation score but could n't find it .
took _num_ minutes to get a cheese pizza slice .
confused orders , and was late when the food did finally deliver .
its reheated pizza and garlic knots .
no frills .
nothing special .
should n't that be included in the price of the pizza ?
otherwise , not worth taking the chance again .
also , will not recommend .
if i could give this place less than a star i would .
the guy went over and grabbed it and handed it to me .
he just handed it to me and walked away .
needless to say , i am angry about my experience .
not going back .
garbage service and poor quality pizza .
it 's pizza and _num_ .
not worth going back .
went here for the first time tonight .
i really have nothing positive to say about the food itself .
went late on saturday night in a word lousy !
the place truly deserves the bad reviews .
the service is poor .
the pizza is average so i 'm giving _num_ stars for the pizza .
the salad was good , but the slices , truly disappointing .
and , the worst part was the service .
i arrived and nothing was ready , and then they forgot my salad .
handed it to me with the dressing with no bag .
service was horrible .
pizza dough was too thick .
looked for utensils to cut pizza but only plastic available .
service was terrible , again .
i felt very uncomfortable through the whole process .
so unhappy .
i could have gone to little cesar 's and purchase _num_ for that price .
we stopped in for lunch and were disappointed .
i opened my salad and there was rotten lettuce .
i returned it to the counter and they graciously gave me another .
i did n't eat the salad .
i will not go back .
the other half was white , doughy , uncooked toppings .
it was a little more done , but absolutely disgusting .
it was so soggy and greasy that it would n't even hold the toppings .
they slide off as soon as i pick up the pizza .
it made me sick and i lost my appetite .
i was extremely disappointed .
do n't waste your time .
what i do n't like is the really poor service .
no apologies , no fresh steak , no free desert .
i did not eat it or send it back and no one cared .
the kitchen was closed a few minutes before we sat down .
nothing , just drinks .
i expected more for my money .
short and not so sweet on this one .
great service ?
Positive
negative _num_ .
chris , morton , capitol , frisco , palm and outback .
this used to be one of my favorite spots to meet up with friends .
not to shabby but do have some complaints .
anywho , we went during restaurant week and did order from that menu .
hence `` homemade '' i assume .
what a shame too .
i would n't order this again as it came out room temp .
and the first bite had me at `` a little stale '' .
it could , and should , have been much better .
especially for the type of place this is supposed to be .
met a friend for drinks and ate from the bar menu .
she said her burger was super salty and the homemade chips were stale .
i left hungry and annoyed .
it was not .
i ate a few bites thinking it might get better .
i wo n't go back and would not recommend this restaurant .
why is this local landmark so disappointing .
i personally do n't like the fact hat you have to purchase everything separately .
i expected he food to be much better than it was for the prices .
staff was not very friendly .
this place has really gone downhill .
waitress had no clue about menu .
could not ring drinks in properly .
went for lunch with coworkers .
another coworker complained about the steak not being cooked right .
the chairs were too heavy and took up too much space .
music in bathroom was too loud .
i will not return and will not recommend .
sadly , i have to say my last experience was not really that great .
i 'm sad that it was n't great .
not s fan !
not impressed think i 'll stick with beef and bottle !
all in all , they are very proud of a mediocre experience .
for the money , i will not return .
food was worth at least _num_ stars -- maybe _num_ .
i also tried sullivan 's during restaurant week .
the meal began as a disappointment and ended that way .
the salad was large but the lettuce was wilted and the croutons were soggy .
it may have even been prepared the day before .
our service was n't much better .
i will never return to sullivan 's and would not recommend it to anyone .
but the biggest disappointment was no jazz music as advertised .
however , on this visit , my steak was not cooked properly .
i ordered a long bone dry aged ribeye , medium rare .
this was not done at sullivan 's .
quite disappointed .
we were never brought plates for our appetizers .
sullivan 's is lacking in attention to details .
i recommend you spend your hard earned money elsewhere .
food was delicious , service was awful .
took approximately _num_ minutes just to close the tab .
my experience was a _num_ star !
it was too loud for a nice conversation .
tuna - my friend said , incredible !
it went downhill from there .
we were dressed appropriately and the place was not crowded .
do n't think i 'll be going back .
i went in for a full set with gel polish .
she cut my cuticles pretty badly and the skin on my fingers are peeling .
i was completely ignored .
no one said hello .
no one asked if i was looking for something in particular .
so disappointed .
too bad the dilworth neighborhood does n't have many inexpensive breakfast options any more .
they need more parking or more signs to warn people of this .
they apparently come every 10-15 minutes to check .
not worth it .
so now any time i stop , it 's just for drinks .
which in itself can be a nightmare .
this past saturday , i visited starbucks on east blvd for an iced coffee .
for another , there are n't enough chairs to even accommodate those tables .
there were empty tables with no chairs around them !
the garbage was overflowing onto the counter .
it looked abandoned .
the outside seating was n't much cleaner .
starbucks should reasonably be embarrassed by this store .
the sense of urgency continues to get worse .
no internet .
bathroom has n't been cleaned for some time .
slow service .
parking is atrocious .
just walk in the store and there it is .
it seems to be hit or miss .
however , they did n't hold a movie for me that i called for .
i normally order a dozen roses from here per month or so .
worst pharmacy customer service ive ever experienced .
they seem understaffed and miserable because of it .
and the bad attitudes are not very becoming .
if you hate your job , find a new one .
since the pharmacy was closed , we went elsewhere .
this is not a nice cvs .
they picked up and immediately hung up the phone .
their pharmacy service has become slow .
ridiculous !
employees here can be hit or miss .
either they are extremely friendly or helpful , or they are extremely rude .
terrible pharmacy .
are n't they suppose to be helpful ?
they are the worst .
i ordered them online and then went to pick them up _num_ hours later .
i will not be taking my pictures back there .
my main issue is they do n't take coupons on a smart phone .
i wish i could say the same for the steel bed frame .
the food is not good at all , and is completely over priced .
yeah , not really my thing .
i like my beer cold .
this place is horrible .
the food is awful and the staff are all snotty .
horrible !
it was pouring rain and the bouncer asked to see my id .
the bench was incredibly uncomfortable .
easy buddy - so am i - it was a total joke .
our wait was not long and our food was delivered by yet another server .
the bill with drinks was a little over $ _num_ reasonable .
however , now i 'm older & more conscious of my surroundings .
in my opinion place could sure use a makeover .
i thought the staff was kind of weird about the rules .
one other thing ... parking situation did not impress .
this venue has never been a cool venue .
it 's a really awkward venue .
my ears are still ringing _num_ hours after the show .
i did n't get to hold my son until three days later !
i was so frustrated with this hospital .
had a very upsetting experience today .
why are people so rude ?
staff was trying to find me on the third floor .
again no explanation of where i was supposed to go .
this place is ghetto and a rip off .
what an expensive mistake i made coming here .
- have had to repeat personal info etc .
i was beginning to wonder .
this is by far the worst hospital emergency room that i have ever experienced .
it 's filthy and packed and is a sorry excuse for a hospital .
please consider going elsewhere before delivering here .
the nurses seemed disinterested and barely helpful .
terrible work .
i went to get my dress hemmed and it was _num_ dollars .
she was very rude and made me feel stupid for pointing them out .
it was a very stressful experience and i will not be going back .
would not recommend her in the future .
did they keep bowling balls in the cabinet ?
regular people not welcome .
i always feel like i get different opinions when i go in here .
there return policy is n't that great and neither are their prices .
not cool .
do n't judge dilworth coffee by this location though !
apparently , neither of which he could do .
`` sorry , i ca n't give you a refund .
dilworth espresso is sadly not dilworth coffee .
and it took such a long time to get my drink .
however , they do have outdoor seating .
the sushi was ok , definitely not the best i ever had .
the atmosphere makes me feel like i 'm in new york or chicago .
however , the food is just ok .
boy , that was a mistake .
the wait for a table was unpleasant and long .
the food was all right , though not incredibly impressive .
i hate this place .
are you kidding me ?
so i would recommend you go ... elsewhere , not here .
very rude and unprofessional business .
the service was horrible unlike the reviews .
if i could give no stars i would .
something that would cost me $ _num_ in my best sushi place in california .
its soooo ridiculous .
i 'll never try this place - beware !
for a $ _num_ bento box , i expected quality .
everything in my box tasted to par .
my charlotte sushi experience was looking on the up !
so why _num_ stars ?
regardless of the cause , something was not right about that dinner .
will not be back .
it was all one big joke until i actually came here .
lame .
anyway , on to the food .
spicy tuna nachos ?
case in point , i dined there with friends and we split the bill .
ridiculous !
well , why would they bring out a smaller amount .
i am so dissappointed that they have started to cut corners .
i ordered the salmon with gorgonzola sauce for take out .
what the hell !
not even worth a dollar .
that 's the only way the fish could have been so overcooked .
it was like a hockey puck .
again , the blind cook probably just put double the amount of mushrooms instead .
two thumbs down .
is that too much to ask ?
of course i was at the only location i know , in south end .
i really wish someone would communicate that .
fail !
this was the worst food i 've ever had .
do not recommend !
if i could give it zero stars i would !
however , friday night i was appalled !
also , everything was sticky , which just grossed me out .
it also smelled musty in there .
the reason for _num_ star is that it is advertised as gluten free friendly .
bad experience .
it 's just frustrating that they market as friendly , but have no options .
disappointing .
wait time : none , which was nice .
nothing was really anticipated of our needs .
it was a saturday night at 7pm and only half the place was filled .
drinks have been forgotten .
when they realized they messed up , they stopped coming to check on us .
surely disappointed in the evening .
on my first visit , i ordered a vegetarian noodle dish .
the waiter brought it out with chicken in it .
no problem , mistakes happen .
about _num_ minutes later , the waiter brought out the dish again .
it was the first time i saw my boyfriend not finish chocolate cake .
no imagination whatsoever !
the only highlights were the owner dancing and our server who was very attentive !
parking is frustrating .
my friends and i are never going there again .
lunch is not busy and the service is sooo slow !
there are tons of better sushi place in charlotte .
the music was loud and overbearing for a date .
the rolls were mushy and the fish was not fresh .
my boyfriend almost spit his out , i had to beg him not too .
parking is frustrating .
the worst collection of art suited for those who know very little about art .
i drove all the way for nothing .
we walked out and have n't been back since .
hit or miss ?
maybe ... but it was a miss for me .
big disappointment .
chicken wings were well cooked , hot and crisp .
but the killer was the smell of the oil on the bread .
the plain fries that came with the sandwich were no better than the others .
in summary : overpriced and not very good .
service was a bit slow .
overpriced , food is pathetic compared to persian kabobs .
are you kidding me ?
charlotte is in desperate need of a persian kabob house .
i can never go back and i am bummed about it !
my husband and i had been frequenting kabob grille .
more yelling - hitting cars - more yelling - pushing .
none of the above happened .
this place is far too expensive for what you get !
these wraps did n't even include a side item .
i really hate giving kabob grill such a low rating .
my last trip here was terrible .
one of the more disappointing wrap experience that i 've had .
barely any meat , mostly pita and lettuce .
no distinct flavor .
costs over $ _num_ with tax and does n't even come with a side .
not worth it for the prices that they charge .
but the size of the portion is small .
this seems sketchy to me , kabob grill .
it was just off .
- baklava : 4/5 ; pretty standard .
the gyro wrap was alright , but still nothing great .
big mistake .
it ruined the appetizer , imo .
husband ordered the chicken pita wrap .
hardly any chicken on it and it came with no sides .
otherwise , it would just have gotten _num_ star .
i wo n't be back .
i 'm really not a fan of this place .
the tables were n't very comfortable either .
however the service is pretty bad .
the pita bread was horrible ... like it was purchased from harris teeter .
i will not be back .
even though i live very close by , oh well .
i will not be back .
not even close .
what we got is two sad , over cooked pieces of falafel .
the wraps were just so-so - protein was , again , over cooked .
for example , now a side of rice costs $ _num_ .
that , in my opinion , is nuts .
too bad , because this place used to be a gem .
also very expensive for not the best .
recently i made a purchase at closing time on a friday .
i am truly offended .
the prices are high , but still less than new items cost .
wow the owner here is extremely rude and seemed to talk down to me .
rude rude rude .
i have been taking my dry cleaning here for over a year .
do n't waist your time on this ignorant shop , they lost my business .
this is the absolute worst dry cleaners i have ever been to .
whatever you do , avoid this place at all cost !
no tour .
no explanation .
no personalized questions to find her dream dress .
no smiles .
the service , however , leaves much to be desired .
do n't waste your time , money or frustration with this place .
even then neither said a word !
my gf told me they 've had bad customer service throughout her entire process .
and i got to see first hand how horrible it was .
she , nor any of her bridesmaids will be giving them another penny .
horrible customer service .
unfortunately mine was very sub par .
and never once have any of us received any sort of apology .
we were so insanely late to the meeting we missed the entire thing .
will never , ever , ever , go back here .
expired cereal boxes on buffet , only regular milk , no sugar free syrup .
gross , i dont understand this place at all .
be prepared to wait up to an hour to be seated for weekend brunch .
i was really looking forward to trying this place but was totally underwhelmed .
the service was friendly but slow .
i ordered a carolina classic burger , which has chili and slaw on it .
everything tastes like it was frozen and store bought .
not going back .
my meatloaf sandwich was utterly forgettable , as were the fries .
my son 's mac n cheese was bland .
the star of the table was the hawaiian chicken sandwich .
the host had an attitude and the bathrooms and dining area stunk .
they had a bucket under the sink to catch a leak .
just left this place and will not be returning !
the lack of customer service the girl behind the bar offered was atrocious .
she had zero personality and hated her life it seemed .
shoddy customer service to say the least and less than quality ice cream .
just came here for a mother 's day brunch .
once up at the buffet it got worse .
there were things that were cold and picked over as well .
my family and i left shortly after another family .
there is no reason to return and my family and i will not .
the place looked like any normal restaurant and our waitress was annoying .
i was really disappointed by the carolina burger i got .
it was n't even in the top _num_ burgers i had on my trip .
the limeade was too sweet .
wrong .
giving _num_ starts instead of _num_ because of it 's pleasant atmosphere .
rather than having a milkshake they served me chocolate milk - literally .
there was n't any ice cream in that milkshake .
the brunch buffet options were alright .
our service was slow ... slow ... slow .
very poor service and they were not that busy .
the service is the reason why we will not be back .
it took to long to get checks , food , and drinks .
a mistake i wo n't make again .
i was part of a party of _num_ with a reservation this morning .
the reservation was confirmed the day before ( and made weeks in advance ) .
very disappointing .
service was severely lacking this morning .
others were sat before us and we were told a _num_ minute wait .
i am very disappointed in the restaurant owner .
he replied and stated he had bread with no egg and ice cream .
she returned and stated all the bread had egg .
the food tasted ok but the portions were super small .
the service was slow and the wait was too long !
i was really excited to try this charlotte staple .
blown away i was not .
hey , maybe it was an off day .
i will definitely not be going back .
it was not good at all .
it was a horrible way to start my day .
needless to say we will not be going back .
the service was okay but our waitress kept forgetting everything we ordered .
it was just awful .
but no , it 's just an excuse not to update anything .
its gross , old , and ruined furniture .
i 've come here twice and got awful service each time .
if i could give this _num_ stars i would .
food was good but the server and service were terrible .
went to the sunday brunch buffet and it was awful .
all out of scrambled eggs and took _num_ minutes to get more .
terrible , wo n't be going back here .
he said the lettuce was dry and the meal was `` just fair '' .
i touched the outside of one of the containers and it was room temperature .
no thanks i 'll pass .
disgusting !
bacon -- it was bits and pieces of bacon not strips .
i ordered a vegetable platter , _num_ items .
also there were only a few selections for salad dressings .
while the food was great , the manager was very rude to us .
the manager did n't greet us when we came in .
we could n't hear what was said but she was sent away in tears .
we were incredibly confused by what was happening .
they were extremely worried about her especially when they saw her crying .
no problem buddy , i 'll do that from now on .
is this a sports bar or some check `` mid scale '' knock off ?
i did n't get any drinks from there so it was cool .
over all , its a ok place , kinda pricey imo .
we left , feeling very eh about both the server and the food .
terrible service .
_num_ min to get appetizer and _num_ min from ordering to getting food .
also waited most of that _num_ min without anything to drink .
the service is terrible .
we waited _num_ minutes on a refill and another _num_ for our check .
our waitress was rude .
if the service was better i would come back .
unfortunately it 's not .
the first time was fine , nothing to complain about there .
last night , however , literally gave me nightmares .
we jumped up and walked over to the bar .
it 's not our fault , i swear ! ''
i went home and cleaned my apartment from top to bottom .
needless to say , i will not be going back to this place .
just plain terrible .
stopped here for a bite to eat after happy hour at gin mill .
completely and utterly disappointing .
please do n't rip off your customers .
so two friends went inside to get drinks from the bar .
needless to say no one ever came by our table again .
took _num_ min to let them know ?
you get zero stars !
some in our party arrived before me and went to gin mill first .
i used to come 2-3 times a week , now about once a month .
horrible experience !
very frustrating .
smoked salmon , potato pancakes , it was all delish .
no thanks .
his plate was just sad .
my only exception to this rule is with breakfast .
this restaurant needs serious training in the customer service department .
was n't impressed .
wait was expected for a sunday morning .
noise from the kitchen was overwhelming .
could hardly hear each other .
very disappointed in my meal today .
i got the eggs michael & it was delish .
it was like snow falling on me throughout my whole meal .
not so cool .
when our food finally arrived , we had no utensils .
needless to say , it was a horrible experience !
the crowd here is boring .
the bartenders were a little limited in their knowledge of drinks .
nothing really stood out about this place .
it 's not like i have anything bad to really say about the place .
i just have nothing good to say about it either .
after tonight , i felt the need to post my opinion about this place .
was n't too impressed with the place .
they could do more with the minimal space , was a little dissappointed .
a step back tonight _num_ when they were built .
this leaves you with a feeling of being in a cheap motel .
my move in maintenance request was submitted _num_ weeks ago nothing has been done .
bad experience !
charge : $ _num_ !
unless it was a rip off ?
why would i go expecting to get screwed ?
thanks sunset club for putting me through hell .
the dj was probably the only good thing in here .
i told the bartender she must have made a mistake .
she goes , oh its not a mistake .
my friend & i drove out on a monday & the shop was closed .
it says that the hours are 1pm til _num_ pm .
my boys are officially done with trying to visit .
no , actually , there was not a way .
_num_ stars .
am i missing something ?
i just do n't see why people give this place _num_ or _num_ stars .
i went with a gyro combo with french fries for about $ _num_ .
order took way to long after to receive too .
needless to say i 'll never visit this location again !
it was not good .
the server was patient with my party of _num_ .
this facility is absolutely horrible .
they have terrible customer service .
long wait time .
it has been six months and i called to get more contacts .
their staff was very rude and cold towards me .
however , they were a little over friendly and inappropriate towards my husband .
it should be zero stars .
this place is terrible and everyone that works there seems completely incompetent .
this place is the worst customer service is horrible .
the staff is rude and this place is so out dated with technology .
a bit of a dump , somewhat trashy scene .
big disappointment .
i went back a second time months later and it was worse .
dogs just ok , nothing special and same with the burgers .
would have been higher rating but the service was terrible .
disappointed .
the food is not anything special , definitely not as good as five guys .
and only has _num_ rings in it ?
me and my husband visited this place for the first time this weekend .
this was the worst mistake ever !
both of these responses were unacceptable !
this place literally put a bad taste in my mouth !
plus the booths , tables , and chairs were nasty and old !
the food was pretty bland .
the cheese sauce for the fries was fairly watery and bland .
fries were ok , nothing special .
all in all , i regret driving past mcdonald 's to get here .
the food was pretty bland .
the cheese sauce for the fries was fairly watery and bland .
fries were ok , nothing special .
all in all , i regret driving past mcdonald 's to get here .
stop wasting your time .
there are no decent hot meals ; terrible taste and variety .
the bakery is no good either .
the standard is far below what it should be here .
scum bags .
as for the food , it 's just ok .
shame on you .
brixx does n't fit the bill .
however , the the average _num_ '' pizza was around $ _num_ .
they specialize in thin crust pizzas .
if you think brixx is good pizza then you have never had good pizza .
even for the pizza waste land that is charlotte , brixx is disappointing .
specials are not great but prices on the list are reasonable .
twice in a row this place has gotten my order wrong .
it was n't tasty at all and i lost my appetite .
there are better pizza places in charlotte .
went with a big group and shared a salad and a chicken caprese pizza .
pepperoni pizza was mediocre , it was lacking sauce and cheese !
c'mon cheese and sauce is what makes pizza !
hawaiian pizza , was eh ok .
the crust tasted pretty bland , a bit like cardboard .
$ _num_ for three pizzas , not worth it .
this is not good pizza .
getting in and out of their parking lot can be a test to patience .
we also were greeted very quickly .
my sandwich was $ _num_ ... ok price i suppose .
the chicken was very dry , and lacked flavor .
i took _num_ bites , and i found it soggy at the bottom .
i 've been to other brixx before & was never this disappointed .
all in all , the food was good , but the service was awful .
no thanks .
i 'll spend my money where they appreciate everyone 's business .
however , i went to this location last night and had a horrific experience .
we had the worst service and our server was beyond rude .
the bread was also dry .
i 'm not sure if it was an off night or what .
salad was not good .
i would not recommend anything other than the pizza .
never going back .
we opted for the check and ended up waiting another _num_ minutes .
the food was marginal to disappointing , once again not the caliber to expect .
go to lulu 's off central instead .
it 's sad when a florist just does n't care anymore .
what was delivered to my wife was a poor excuse for a bouquet .
there were barely any flowers in it at all .
one of the flowers died almost immediately .
flowers from the farmers market have been much cheaper and lasted longer .
will not use this florist again .
pool , expensive video games , air hockey ) .
service - friendly , confused , helpful .
this kind of stunk , as pool was the reason we went here .
so i chose the booze .
other than that , this is not the best game in town .
i was shocked to see how empty the place was .
bad beer , always slow and old games .
not my experience at all .
the place was dirty , disorganized , smelled and the owner is rude .
usually have a great experience but the last time was awful !
food is not standard quality and service is awful .
_num_ people for a rehearsal dinner for our wedding .
he said ok , i 'll figure it out .
i spent a great deal of money that night for nothing .
i can not support a place so unprofessional .
it 's spaghetti and you 're an italian restaurant .
i have never seen a delivery charge , rather a minimum order for delivery .
i 've been to this chain before , just not this location .
what a disappointment .
what a disappointment .
dumped on top .
my boyfriend and i went here for our year and a half anniversary .
actually , maybe not .
and was off before i could even ask about our food .
a few minutes later , he presented me with a salad .
so i assumed they could n't split the linguine order .
there 's a couple of things i do n't understand how you screw up .
the choices are creamy parmesan , ceasar , and italian .
he never offered us more bread and overall was n't very pleasant .
i got the side salad with parmesan dressing and he the minestrone .
how absurd !
do n't know if we 'll go back .
thought the shrimp and scallops were too salty .
disappointed as we had a good experience a carrabba 's some time ago .
now , our problem was totally our waitress she was having a bad night !
bad , bad , bad !
food was bad , waiter was bad .
i report , you decide .
carrabba 's just flat out sucks .
not so much anymore .
i rather go to chile 's than eat this mess again .
there was more goat cheese than steak and the steak was pretty rare .
food and service both not good .
this restaurant can not handle large groups for lunch .
they ran out of bread and lemonade and the pizza oven was not working .
come on people , should n't i get bread ?
when i called it told me to press _num_ for delivery .
i tried _num_ more times , still no answer !
after _num_ minutes on hold a manager , steve , gets on the phone .
he just said ok sorry and that was it .
horrible customer service .
steve needs some customer service training !
twice i had to send my food back .
the worst restaurant we have been to in charlotte .
the oil for the bread came later , and not with the bread .
the only good thing about this place was the soup .
do not waste your time or money .
our service was slow .
the food was awful .
it was bland and the chicken looked questionable .
ordered a brownie for dessert that was blah with chocolate sauce that was cold .
none of them smile .
none of them seem happy to see you at all .
miserable bunch of people .
lots of people standing around doing nothing while everyone is waiting on something .
this was a mistake .
it 's loud and the server seems to forget you are there .
it was not clear on the menu so i wanted to make sure .
the unhappy wait staff .
wo n't be going back again .
as far as i am concerned it 's a tourist trap .
the pizza oven is still broken .
this place should be shut down until they get it running right .
my main reason for giving this place _num_ stars is because of our waitress .
she was awful .
took _num_ minutes to even get our drinks .
then another _num_ to get our salads .
service here on a saturday was awful !
the food was fine but the service was awful .
we waited over _num_ minutes for the server just to run our cards .
we will not be going back .
all he could comp me was some more alfredo .
save your money and try a local italian spot .
without question one of the worst meals i 've had in recently history .
but free was n't good enough .
i should have been paid to eat this garbage .
oh wait , no it 's not , stupid people still exist .
horrible food and horrible service .
the food had absolutely no flavor and the dish preparation was zero .
for the prices you pay at carrabba 's i would expect a higher standard .
the food was stale , not fresh .
my wife and i went here on sunday for lunch .
she had a cinnamon roll : dry and stale .
not an epic fail , mind you .
i got a chicken salad salad .
salad did n't really taste like much .
yeah , i wo n't be back .
unfortunately my past two visits have been very disappointing .
i have tried many of the soups , all pretty bland .
i needed a quick bite before a meeting and settled here by default .
i could n't even finish my chicken `` gumbo . ''
the turkey sandwich filled me up , at least .
i was so bummed today after i went in for a smoothie .
their chicken always tastes dry .
the store hours posted on the door said 9pm closing .
and they were not even filling .
no bueno !
rude management and horrible service .
can you give me utensils and napkins to go ?
just bad attitude and service ... ... .
although the store itself was nice , i was not impressed with their products .
a week later , still no call .
yep , _num_ days to clean a comforter .
false .
with these people , everything was a mess .
fail fail fail .
will not be returning .
i tried to give them no stars but it 's not available .
horrible and expensive !
it took me _num_ weeks from start to finish to get my new glasses .
i never received any calls or updates from the staff .
very disappointed .
i will not be returning .
it did n't look like it had even been vacuumed .
ca n't really complain about the car wash itself , pretty standard .
all in all , it was just okay .
would probably like to try somewhere else next time instead .
i have 3rd row seating and nothing past the 2nd row was even touched .
and do n't tip .
they do n't deserve it .
no need for them to rush .
your service is getting worse each time i come .
unfortunately , they just seem to be getting worse .
they sent all the results and paperwork back to long 's .
what a mess .
long 's just was n't capable of treating his condition .
why should i have to tell you what meds my dog is on ?
why should i have to tell them what they diagnosed last time ?
i could never understand how anyone could leave their dog in those conditions .
is that too much to ask ?
do not make the mistake of boarding here .
wrong .
he did n't even want to jump up into my vehicle to leave .
oh , but they did n't charge me for the office visit .
avoid this business at all costs .
what went wrong ?
i would seriously consider going to another veterinarian if i were you .
with a new dog , that 's not a good thing .
not once did anyone talk to me about food , care , etc .
wo n't be going back .
i think i will be searching for a new vet though .
they were very busy , but extremely caring .
i was called multiple times with updates .
my advice is think twice before going here !
never asked what our names were or gave a crap about anything .
he did n't even acknowledge our cat who was underneath the bench crying .
so after he `` examined '' him all he said was he looks sick .
_num_ is low ?
but that was their only payment plan that they would do for us .
he never apologized never said anything to make us feel better or anything .
i do n't even know his name because he never introduced himself to us .
i have been going to this facility for almost a year .
just let him lay there and die all dirty .
poor kitty .
from now on my pet will see only dr. james or will go elsewhere .
i 'm just trying to help other pet owners with this review .
worse mcdonald 's i have ever been to .
no matter what time you come whether late or early they are always slow .
this is the slowest one i 've ever been too .
and to make matters worse , the employees are far from friendly .
corporate should step in and make some serious moves to get this under control .
food is mcdonalds standard , ok if there 's no other choice .
then she `` ordered '' me to pull off to park and wait .
the employees at this location were very unprofessional and unorganized .
i do n't plan on ever renting with enterprise again after this .
once that was corrected , he showed me the car .
it was dripping wet - had n't been dried .
i recently flew into to charlotte airport then took a cab to this agency .
it was booked through priceline .
i said i would .
first they offered us a choice of pick-up trucks .
no , we did n't want that .
would have ben noisy .
do n't bother - go to chipotle down the street instead .
went to the drive thru and ordered _num_ chicken tacos .
got home with _num_ beef tacos that went straight in the trash .
i 'm sure it 's a staffing problem .
i find it rude .
i hate being rushed .
the absolute slowest taco bell in history .
absolutely the worst taco bell , if not restaurant i have ever been too .
no management , or they do n't care .
turn away now if you are considering this place !
and they still did not fix it .
if that were n't enough , my license plate was stolen .
i 'm not kidding .
so brian , i 'm sorry .
learn from my mistake .
you will save yourself a major headache .
it does n't surprise me that the inspection is so fast !
it did indeed take _num_ minutes , no complaints .
the woman had forgotten i was out there .
i 'm a customer just like the others waiting .
the bad : the staff .
walked into the store and was the only one waiting to be served .
if its busy when you show up i would try another restaurant .
they charge mucho dollars for crappy food .
the seafood is always overcooked .
for shame .
but , it makes for some seriously awkward dipping with just chips .
this time , however , was not the same .
the corn salsa was bland and room temperature .
the fish was super fishy and not in a good way .
no shrimp in a seafood restaurant ?
very loud place .
it tasted pretty bad .
_num_ star for food .
minus _num_ stars for customer service .
okay , i 'm from san diego .
unfortunately , i 've found this place to be more trendy than good .
if the fish was breaded at the restaurant then why bother breading fish pieces .
the fish itself was fine but i received pieces .
typically , if you cut the fish correctly you wo n't have pieces .
cabo 's did n't feel that way .
the fish taco that my wife had was disappointing and lack luster .
the good , the bad and the ugly .
my waitress forgot my bloody mary , but she did bring me water .
the chips were cold , cold like the bag was sitting outside .
the flour tortilla was cold , it must be really cold in their kitchen .
not appealing at all .
the chips are tasty , but the salsa is totally worthless .
i was not at all impressed .
moreover , i would have liked to have ordered another beer .
but then i just remembered # _num_ so back to _num_ it is .
_num_ .
_num_ .
queso dip = yuck .
chips were cold and stale and the dip was very watery .
_num_ .
dark black soup is not appealing , lol .
even worse when it 's bland .
_num_ .
_num_ .
plus the rice was crunchy and kinda bland .
_num_ .
quality was nonexistent .
this place is awful .
it was vinegary and just bad .
someone else came by and threw the chips and salsa down .
not good .
i was offered some honey wasabi sauce and i accepted but never received it .
fish tacos have no taste , shrimp tacos came out ice cold .
they make you wait forever , service is meh ... .
not real anxious to go back but who knows .
i 've not been crazy about my last few visits to cabo fish taco .
tried the fish tacos and they were n't really exciting .
ugh , stale chips mixed in w/ fresh chips .
that 's weak .
the food was decent but i 'm not going back again .
i think i 'm throwing the towel in on you , cabo .
worst of all the servers seemed annoyed with us when we corrected them .
nope , this is n't the real deal .
but , locals rave about this place .
eating it felt like chewing through paper .
the coleslaw was totally boring .
the chips were stale .
the salsa was extremely bland .
wo n't be back .
i thought every thing was incredibly bland and pretty boring .
not terrible food , but surely nothing spectacular either .
we went with a group , _num_ in all , on saturday .
sat , ordered drinks and crab dip .
_num_ minutes later we asked her again .
it was another full _num_ minutes before food arrived , cold and awful .
we saw others seated , fed , and gone .
our mashed potatoes would n't even melt the cheese .
now , i 'm all for leisurely eating ... but not for this .
they did discount our food , but that was n't the point really .
the corn salsa and chips were stale .
ok noda , do n't let me down again .
oh and the skinny margarita sucks .
our waiter however could have cared less about us .
do n't know what all the rave reviews are for .
wo n't go there again .
our most recent visit paired rude , lackluster service with mediocre food .
and guess what -- she did n't even do that !
i did n't want to pig out , but i left hungry .
i do n't think i 'll be back .
mind you , half the restaurant is still empty .
to compensate us in any way for such poor service .
the tacos were more lettuce than fish and the slaw was rather bland .
needless to say , i wo n't be giving cabo a second chance .
why did n't i do it sooner ?
but it 's just so bad that i do n't want to go back .
well was i wrong about that .
only if you have low fish tacos standards .
that being said the food was nothing to write home about .
_num_ .
our chips were stale .
my shrimp tacos were really boring .
we have had mixed reviews about cabo but it has just gone downhill recently .
we were disappointed .
firstly , the guacamole was obviously out of a container .
of course , cabo will charge you considerably more .
the fish was overcooked , the sauces were just gross .
the beer was great but the margarita was the worst margarita ever served .
overall i would not recommend this restaurant and i definitely will not return .
it was so loud , that it was hard to carry on a conversation .
or the food improving itself by half ( either way suits me ) .
trying to fill that void .
does anyone else have that restaurant they do n't understand why they patron ?
my husband and i went to cabo fish taco last night .
it was the second time we 've eaten there in _num_ months .
the first time we fell in love .
last night , however , my husband got food poisoning .
two and a half stars , ok but not so great .
with tangy bbq sauce ?
the sauce was tasty but out of place , it overpowered the whole dish .
here it was so bland it could have been a chicken .
mediocre food .
absurd wait times .
really really loud .
cabo , i 'm just not that into you .
i 'd had tacos from this place before and they were amazing .
fine , no big deal .
this set a bad tone for the rest of the experience .
there was a low amount of cilantro accompanied with a low amount of flavor .
the shrimp were n't bad , but not the best i 've ever had .
check your tastebuds at the door !
glad to say neither of us became physically ill !
equally as disappointing as the worst parts of the meal !
instead they say : `` everything 's good is n't it '' ?
the meal was so disappointing we went out to eat after leaving this place !
i hate writing _num_ star reviews !
seriously guys , why is the fish so dry and bland .
i really , really want to like this place .
the last time i ate at cabo fish taco was probably _num_ or _num_ .
both were mediocre , at best .
our beers were very over priced as well .
overall , i will never go back there again .
ugh .
and i 'm sure not paying you extra for atmosphere .
* weird cold corn salsa with stale `` cardboard '' blue corn tortillas .
mmmm , no .
( served with hot tortilla chips , which does n't happen here ! )
ps : i like guy fieri , but he 's not always right .
this place really went down hill .
the food just does n't seem fresh and it lacks flavor .
service has never been good but we never expected it in this place .
it was pretty crowded but there was no wait .
the fish in both were way overcooked and dry .
they had that store bought flour tortilla smell .
however i was greatly disappointed in the tacos .
the salsa served with drinks was bland and dry with corn and tomatoes .
mine was extremely spicy and his was not spicy at all .
mine was still extremely spicy and his had no spiciness at all .
while the food was amazing , the service was lacking .
the _num_ minute wait ended up being over an hour .
thankfully the areas surrounding the restaurant were entertaining enough to keep me occupied .
_num_ .
beer battered fish tacos had way to much batter .
_num_ .
chicken quesadillas were nothing more than mediocre .
_num_ .
bbq mahi tacos were decent .
now , it 's all gone down hill .
every time i 've eaten there recently it 's terrible .
recently i got the veggie fajitas .
it was so gross .
i did n't finish it .
so last week i went there ( why ?
anyway i started feeling an upset stomach after the first part of the wrap .
i threw up around _num_ times that day .
i have never felt so sick .
chips and pico were served .
wrong !
( $ _num_ for _num_ tacos _num_ side ) .
they were wrong in all senses of the word .
it had absolutely no flavor .
blackened is supposed to be very flavorful people !
it was decoration , i guess .
for my _num_ side i chose the refried beans .
tastes like cheap canned beans .
even the beer was a hot mess .
i 'm not quite sure what all the hype is about .
this place was not very good at all .
what a disappointment !
not a good experience ... .
you 're lazy .
tacky .
the shrimp and crab dip , way too creamy .
not for us .
nightmare !
horrible service , food and poor attitudes !
this place use to be on our short list of regular places to visit .
it was cold .
that was a turn off .
my son got the $ _num_ shrimp burrito from the kids menu .
she picked the shrimp out and ate them solo .
, he left his slaw to the trash .
not sure we will be back , which makes me sad .
the service has always been awesome though .
this place is terrible where did they get the fish ?
did not look like any fish that i have ever had .
it was so bad i took two bites and left .
i will never step foot in this establishment again .
i was completely disappointed .
secondly , the food was just ok .
i got chicken tacos that were dry and flavorless .
either way , i will not be returning .
because of this , it was not the best service .
however , food was worst .
and my fist taco was just bland and not good .
none of which was present in any of the food !
sadly , we had a really bad experience .
the black beans and rice had no flavor .
it was just not a meal i would ever come back for .
the fish was bland and not particularly anything to write home about .
that should 've been my first sign .
spent the next two days in bed feeling miserable .
but it totally sucks .
do n't ever get the trout taco special .
they are crap !
cabo fish taco has really gone down hill lately .
the service is good the food is crap !
and the chips were completely stale .
slow .
and simply nothing special about the food .
after being repeat customers we had the worst experience with customer service .
since that time we have not been back and will not return .
got the tuna salad for dinner sunday night .
do n't believe the hype .
my chicken taco was so dry that a knife could n't even cut it .
we hardly ate any of our food .
will not be returning .
i 'm not quite sure how it gets such good reviews .
every time i come i get bad service and bad food .
the queso was cold and chips were stale .
service also sucked .
the only positive was the salsa .
the last time before this week that i had a meal there was _num_ .
the service was at best mediocre .
wrong !
whatever that corn stuff they bring to the table is was horrible .
none of the condiments at the table could make it much better .
wrong !
i surely would not want my signature on that !
this place has really lost what they once had .
i went to cabo fish taco tonight after seeing a live music show .
same with the rice and beans i ordered as a side .
really sub par .
horrendous service and attitude from both waitress and management .
extremely poor service .
do not recommend to anyone .
i ordered the mahi bbq taco and it was very good .
the tuna from cabo fish taco really tasted off .
my friend john got the lemon grilled shrimp tacos and was not happy .
i tried the shrimp and it did not taste fresh .
i will never return and will not recommend to anyone .
i doubt i 'll be back .
not well prepared , low quality ingredients ... i do n't get it .
how can your salsa be lame ?
it did n't get better .
so so so awful !
i really do n't understand people that like this place .
stale , cold chips .
they did n't even try to dress it up .
so bad , so so bad .
first off , the chips , salsa , and queso .
not a good start .
for entrees , we split the specialty tuna and bbq mahi tacos .
requested tuna medium rare , but received overcooked tuna .
rice and beans on the side were flavorless .
i 've been here _num_ times .
first time the food was bland , cold , and my tortillas were soggy .
the second time was just terrible .
it 's not an experience that i ever care to have again .
went here for the first time tonight .
it was crowded , but we were sat right away on the outdoor patio .
have n't been back .
the waiter we had , matt , was the absolute worst .
he should not be serving .
all around - horrible horrible horrible horrible , and even more horrible .
they are not `` authentic '' .
they have very little food made in house .
although my boyfriends tuna burrito is a perfect medium .
the salsa is pretty average , nothing to write home about .
it was a weeknight ( a wednesday ) at 7pm .
so , we had to wait even more .
i 've never seen such a horrible waitress before .
also , the salads are horrible .
i got the tuna one and it was gross .
not worth the $ _num_ .
just stick with a margarita and queso .
this was probably the most boring meal i have ever had .
margarita tasted like it was a pre-made mix as well .
overall disappointing .
poor customer service .
so so so awful !
i really do n't understand people that like this place .
stale , cold chips .
they did n't even try to dress it up .
so bad , so so bad .
my experience last was horrible , not the food but the service .
i realized i received a text msg _num_ minutes earlier .
looks like a socal beach dive has landed in noda .
both times i have gone they have given me the wrong food .
it 's a shame the service is so poor because the food is delicious .
wo n't be returning .
otherwise , i 'd suggest you skip it and enjoy classic southern soul food .
i was hungry , but stale .
i do n't eat beans so gave those to the husband .
not so much .
i can not recommend this place .
fish was n't cooked all the way through .
server hardly returned to see how we were doing .
possibly assuming it was her tip ?
when should you ever assume though ?
so why would n't they check before having me drive all the way there ?
no thanks .
thanks for nothing , glad i found the other nursery though .
the work was sloppy and not what i am used to .
this time i walked in to get a manicure .
customer service regarding this incident was extremely poor .
went here based on the reviews and was not impressed at all !
they definitely are busy , but not my style .
not clean and not particular enough for me.
to top it off , the pedicure was rushed .
very messy .
wo n't be back .
the gel manicure i got was applied incorrectly .
it was a waste of money .
i was confused but say perhaps she had an appointment .
she says oh someone else is coming to help me .
still makes no sense though .
i wait another _num_ mins and no one has come .
as i get my shoes one , finally my technician has made an appearance .
never have i ever paid for that .
we walked in and the place seemed ok at first .
i ca n't believe she would talk to a customer like that .
a week passes , and no call .
the medicine is supposed to be $ _num_ for a _num_ month supply .
ugh .
i know i 'm not a vet , but i 'm not stupid either .
no thanks .
the high today in charlotte , nc was _num_ degrees .
no one should have been outside today .
over the years it seems that the quality of services have gone down .
i went over for a visit since they had been there over a week .
the smell was just as bad .
several cats had no water .
i just do n't get this place 's success .
bland food in a bland atmosphere .
i 'm with tony c. on this one .
to me , the bbq was greasy and nasty .
believe me , i was paying for it later .
unfortunately , it 's the lowest rating possible to provide a review .
if there could be lower than one star i would provide that .
customer service is sub par .
dealing with them is like dealing with less the bright _num_ year olds .
if you can avoid this individual and or people do so at all costs .
i got a piece of cake , but was horribly disappointed .
the cake was dry as if it were a few days old .
i was also disappointed with their selection of baked goods at the counter .
they have a very limited selection .
i woke up this morning wanting cheesecake .
they had cannoli , and that 's hard to find in this city .
first of all , there were only _num_ people there .
it should have been packed , and i understand why it was n't .
i was n't at all impressed with their selection of sweet bakery items .
the baklava did n't disappoint , though i 'm not a huge fan .
soggy cannoli .
they deserve better love !
dear cannoli , i 'll be looking for you elsewhere !
the cannoli shell itself was heavy , dense , and oily .
cannoli shells should be light , and somewhat crunchy .
maybe i 'll be back to give that a try ... but the cannoli ?
no thank you .
now for the bad .
customer service is left to be desired to top a less than average bakery .
no macaroons .
i was n't wowed by anything here despite their having been on television .
i 'm always looking to be wowed so maybe my expectations are too high .
i would -- i was just expecting a little bit more is all .
had the best iced vanilla chai latte every single time .
but today alone has made me never want to go again .
she got my drink order ( two of the same ) wrong .
every nova 's experience is a bland one .
the service is slow , the products mediocre .
my coffee or tea is always served too hot to drink .
just completely unorganized .
horrible service .
went here on a whim for after dinner treats last night .
unfortunately , the cookies we got were stale and very underwhelming .
the pastries are stale and so extremely bland .
not good at all .
too bad there are no amazing german or true french bakeries in charlotte .
i would definitely never purchase from bland nova again .
very small little place .
i dined alone so i was watching what goes on .
i just do n't like to see stuff like that .
its too cheap !
i am not looking for the cheapest price for the cheapest food .
instead , i am looking for quality food at a reasonable price .
i can not say enough about how friendly the staff was .
however , i had not sat down because every single open table was dirty .
this was the worst experience ever .
i will no go there again .
nothing special , and it 's cash only .
`` wrong and strong '' is no way to face the public .
they treated his symptoms and respected my budget .
i have n't been back , and i do n't plan to go back .
the staff here is pretty inconsistent .
very few vets remain from visit to visit , turnover is frequent .
it sounds bad , but we still go here .
so my cat was given another minor surgery and put on a diet .
after going to the second vet , my cat was like a kitten again .
it just kept getting worse and worse .
i picked her up on wednesday and she was acting better .
thursday night she started acting like she did monday .
doctor cooper was her doctor at that time and she was very rude .
did n't seem to be worried about mia 's condition .
she pretty much flat out said that we should put her down .
but before i brought her in she was healthy .
yes , still dealing with this awful place !
they do n't return phone calls and are very rude !
terrible communication and forget about the customer service .
wo n't be returning .
this fee is in addition to the hours of waiting that you do there .
very disappointed with this vet center .
do not bring your pet to this facility .
this place is going down hill fast .
however , your bill will be a tall one with every visit .
they placed an iv and gave fluids .
it would cost $ _num_ for surgery .
needless to say i wo n't visit again .
if i could give a zero , i would .
my dog died there .
they do not deserve any stars , they deserve to be shut down .
one star is too much for them !
maybe it 's just me but i 'm going to start looking elsewhere .
total oil change time _num_ hours _num_ minutes .
sent an employee to lunch while i waited and generally is an ass .
fast forward and my car is towed there .
no calls this weekend .
no updates .
now the car wo n't be done until wednesday .
not good enough .
this place left the oil cap off after a basic oil change .
i 'm not quite sure what the fuss is about .
there 's stuff everywhere and it 's completely overwhelming .
the music was not laid-back , more like aggressive .
seems like people get pretty comfortable .
downside : not for me .
cool place but slow .
my sandwich was nothing out of the ordinary .
_num_ ) i love that they have beer and wine tastings on occasion .
nothing like trying new stuff !
_num_ ) their food is really bland .
both times i was incredibly disappointed .
the soup tasted watered down and their sandwiches were flavorless and dry .
_num_ ) the parking is not great .
_num_ ) this place is always crowded .
just terrible service .
terribly rude to her .
for my return trip , it was worse .
needless to say , they never called back .
on the departure day , no one showed up .
i was very worried so i called them .
as a result , i missed my international flight .
but the company is completely lack of professionalism or basic courtesy .
but this company failed completely !
at one point i would have rated _num_ stars .
i wo n't say horrible service , but i will say it sucks bad .
this is the worst cab service in charlotte nc .
do n't use this unprofessional service .
what an a hole .
i had crappy service provided by driver with car # _num_ .
i did n't enjoy the experience .
he is so unfriendly and rude .
he will surely lose business with his attitude if he has n't already .
there 's no ambiance to it whatsoever .
it was all those things in _num_ , and is all those things now .
this is n't one of them .
- the lobby is too small and not very inviting .
-the staff did not go out of their way to assist us .
all in all i was pretty disappointed .
it was bizarre .
the acoustics in this venue have always been bad , and they still are .
but the theatre is horrible !
then she poured just a splash of cranberry .
uh , i was wrong .
it was so totally watered down it barely had any flavor at all .
it was very disappointing for seven dollars .
is n't that an illegal practice ?
if not , it should be .
i 'm not against older venues , or even tiny venues .
you can still get _num_ stars .
not their fault , right ?
roughly _num_ % of people attending drive there and park there .
this may not be the forum to express my disappointment but here goes .
seats were terrible .
it does not work very well .
will never return unless i can buy the expensive seats .
student rush said general admission , which was not true .
waste of money due to the seats .
really feel like we got cheated .
parking is horrible .
the facility is old and rundown and the staff is n't very helpful .
i have never had such a horrific experience in my life .
i 'm giving the two stars to the performance only .
however ; it was hard to enjoy anything in such an awful venue .
my legs were so cramped the whole time that they fell asleep .
parking is a nightmare as well .
otherwise , it is just a nightmare .
many people were using the program to fan themselves and it was very uncomfortable .
ruined my first musical experience .
i will never attend another at this awful venue .
awful place .
$ _num_ ?
extremely outdated .
not enough bathrooms .
seats are so uncomfortable .
no food here .
total dive if your looking for that .
Negative
first negative review i have written .
machine takes $ _num_ off of my card for no reason .
ok whatever $ _num_ is n't worth my time .
came back , still had another _num_ min till wash cycle was finished .
left again came back in _num_ minutes around 7:30 .
only thing about closing is 9:00 posted on the door .
can i get the contact info for your boss .
obviously will not be going back .
dear god .
this place is definitely gone further downhill , if that was even possible !
anyway , i would n't go if i was you !
the staff that was working was , simply put , rude .
it 's not like the piercings in front of me were that crazy .
it is , however , rather inexpensive .
deviled eggs that are to die for !
the kitchen staff works hard and the food is ok .
but the wait staff is often inattentive at best and surly at worst .
after several such unpleasant experiences , i 've given up .
i ordered the meat loaf ( recommended by friends ) and the mashed potatoes .
the wait staff ( at least the one working my table ) was horrible .
it 's too bad to see a business so disorganized .
dish was a big disappointment .
- fried green tomatoes were bland and `` hard . ''
a seasoned corn meal batter would 've been much better .
they basically take a traditional spinach dip and substitute collards .
a hint of sweetness i can see , but these were just not good .
the place was almost full when we visited .
waited at the door for _num_ min before we were even acknowledged .
it sucks , i used to love this place .
come back to us old dish , wherever you have gone .
not me !
ok , i get it , i know about the waiter / waitress rotation .
it took our food about _num_ minutes to come out ... seriously ?
i got salmon cakes & macaroni & cheese & deviled eggs .
i have no idea why it took so long .
the food was horrible .
i hardly ate any of it .
still no acknowledgement from our waiter or anyone else for that matter .
will i give dish another chance ?
and the bartender served me promptly .
after about _num_ minutes , the entire party was available so we were seated .
very , very small serving of soup .
we both ordered the salmon patties .
not so this evening .
neither one of us enjoyed our meal & wasted nearly $ _num_ .
however i am willing to give them one more try .
but next time better be hella yummy !
i 've had it other times and it was borderline awful .
so no telling how much cheesy hair goodness i consumed !
needless to say i did not eat the food .
i was n't very impressed with this place .
everything we ordered was either gross or ok at best .
had the worst service i 've ever had in a restaurant .
myself and three friends visited for lunch .
two in the party had never been to your restaurant .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
absolutely a horrible experience .
mashed cauliflower was bland and tasteless and gritty , not creamy at all .
mac and cheese was as generic as possible .
grilled eggplant pita was unusual but no strong spices or flavoring .
overall , pretty disappointing .
i was very disappointed with my burger .
it lacked any type of flavor .
however , kevin really enjoyed his chicken & dumplings .
i mean real simple .
once the plate came out i was excited to dig into my sandwich .
wrong .
after i took a bite , i noticed they forgot the tomato .
how can sliced fruit be bad ?
why is my fruit warm ?
the second star for the veggie loaf i tried from someone else 's plate .
this was our first time dining here after hearing about it for some time .
but our server was pretty much a disaster .
that happens , and we were n't too concerned .
this is not the way you handle a restaurant customer .
mediocre food , lousy service .
wo n't be going back .
also did not have any flavor .
spent _num_ dollars on food that was no better than a frozen dinner .
it was not pleasing to the eye or palate .
both times they failed .
we stopped into this local joint during our hour long lunch break .
the waitress then incredibly rudely said not my fault not my problem !
when we saw the menu we were excited .
i just remember it was so gross .
we were so disappointed .
i just was n't feeling it .
that 's silly to lose a customer over but they 've certainly lost me .
the food was bland and cold .
we wo n't be back , not worth a second try .
this was not our first time eating here .
she was n't sure so i called the waitress over .
i said no i just wanted to speak with the manager .
the waitress has never made a mistake and i ate most of my meal .
it is obvious that all of the employees are scared of this person .
needless to say she lost more than two customers .
i ordered the shrimp shrimp and grits and was not impressed .
the grits were cold and the sauce that came with it was flavorless .
the only good saving grace of the experience were $ _num_ mimosas .
was n't horrible but was n't great .
ate here last night ... first and last time .
deviled egg ... either made earlier in the day or day before .
much better food in charlotte for the price .
avoid this business .
not that i need a walker or anything ( yet ) .
i 'll leave it to you to decide which is more likely .
service is ok , only if u know spanish .
do n't pay extra for the reserved balcony seats .
you can hardly see the stage and the sound is terrible .
this place is a wreck and a fire hazard .
for $ _num_ , you would think there would be seating .
very disappointed .
they no longer have shows in the big theatre where the big stage is .
there 's a bar where you can buy overpriced drinks .
beers were $ _num_ .
there 's no place to sit to watch the bands .
the men 's bathroom reeked of urine .
the current management does n't get it .
we drove from _num_ miles away and were utterly disappointed .
the acoustics in the new space are awful .
however , the building still stands , but it was destroyed from the inside .
no more .
no ac !
even the lead singer commented on how hot it was .
the worst live music venue that i have ever been to .
the band commented that it was the hottest place they ever played .
the bouncer told me they have been operating without ac for awhile .
do n't waste money on tickets for a good band .
in sum , they were very kind and sympathetic , but disorganized .
it is n't .
some people ca n't afford $ _num_ .
my `` sweet boy '' would have been _num_ in june .
also they were looking for was money and not to care for my dog .
but my initial walk in was horrid experience .
entirely too expensive .
they have absolutely no respect for your money .
they would not refund me for the visit .
i would n't recommend this place , ever .
i always feel rushed and my questions are not answered .
upon entering the office , i never felt welcomed .
i found this very offensive and unprofessional .
my first visit was equally unpleasant .
absolutely the worst service i 've ever seen .
i do not recommend that anyone leave their pet in this company 's hands .
scam and neglected my pet .
she said i would hear from him in about _num_ hours .
i 'm not sure how this place is still in business .
this place is terrible .
very bad service .
but it is already _num_ hours late and there is no traffic at all .
scheduled for pickup and delivery to airport .
cab driver never showed up .
do n't be fooled ... it isnt the same .
it 's located in an old warehouse about _num_ mins from uptown .
the music played is terrible .
the roof leaks bad .
i do n't even see how this building passed inspection .
also , the back area does n't have heat or a/c .
the cats that hang out up front are n't there to workout !
unfortunately i 'm stuck here until my contract ends .
when i told her this , she hung up on me !
the taste is n't the same either , even if the style is similar .
and frankly , it 's not as good .
drinks were also quickly refilled .
the service was `` half good '' , but that 's also half bad .
sanitation rating _num_ - not impressive .
chicken and dumplings were good but i just was n't really feeling it .
side of canned green beans , really canned ?
and mac and cheese was okay .
it was just ok .
_num_ stars ?
meh ... not for me .
the food just did n't do it for me .
i was disappointed with both .
the burger was overcooked and tasteless .
i just was n't thrilled .
i am sad to report that we both left pretty disappointed .
maybe i hyped it up too much .
husband ordered the chili dog and he was underwhelmed .
the greasy chips that came on the side were okay i guess ?
not my cup of tea .
apparently it gets very busy , but i personally do not know why .
i tried the nachos , they were n't terrible .
they are insanely big though , so plan to share .
if a friend had not brought me there i would have walked out immediately .
if hygiene is not a big deal with you you may like this place .
no way do i go back .
the burger was dry , as was the bun .
fries were not an option , nor was anything else homemade .
shame i will not be back because of one bad seed .
looked like the place was closed as i drove by , but it wasnt .
the wings came out and was dissapointed that they were not fried wings .
unfortunately ordered in one trip .
am i missing something ?
not the greatest .
wo n't be back for a long time .
i arrived at the smelly cat with this expectation and was severely disappointed .
i would not recommend smelly cat for a delicious or satisfying cup a joe .
um , no .
lacking .
especially when half the water is poured straight down the filter .
these folks need proper training .
the cup itself was marginal .
trendy , but coffee leaves something to be desired .
meh , this has never been a super impressive shop in my opinion .
i guess i find myself bored every time i come back around .
i have n't seen anything new pop up in here .
prices are so high that i 've never once considered buying anything .
do n't bother going here .
i 've been several times and it 's always full of over priced junk .
dirty does not equal vintage .
the guy in there is always rude .
walked inside greeted the worker which from the conversation must be the owner .
the guy that works there is so rude !
they were wrong .
my food experiences were mostly ok , but never anything special .
and the steak sandwich i had was downright crappy .
and then there was a rush of people to be seated .
no egg dishes .
maybe i will try one more time and try the banana pudding ?
simply the worst experience i 've ever had in a restaurant !
had a party of _num_ but _num_ of us got there early .
no one offered to seat us so sat down on our own .
told me i had a right to my `` wrong '' opinion .
there were at least _num_ open tables with no one waiting .
i was very very angry .
the food is n't worth the trouble .
i 've had it before and it is n't that great !
_num_ years ago it used to be cool .
parking lot is pathetic and they do n't care about their customers !
i was not impressed .
the service , except for one waiter , sucked .
i will not be back .
the wait is too long for sub-par , over-priced bar food .
the wait was over an hour , and the staff was rude !
the food was bland , everything needed salt .
the fries were cold , and the burgers were small .
rude .
it is not worth it .
it is loud and the kids will not enjoy the environment .
do n't waste your time .
stole the place from the owners , do n't no one approve .
i even grew up on the east side !
after seeing it on food network , i was excited to try it out .
not to overly impressed with any of it .
the wait staff here lacks that .
so apparently this is n't the one it was anymore .
i wish i had read these reviews before i wasted a one hour trip !
like a lot of places the prices went up & less food !
i will never waste my time coming here again !
the penguin is not what it used to be .
worse yet , no hush puppies !
we will not be going back .
the pickles are much worse , and the burgers just do n't cut it .
the `` new '' penguin drive in leaves a lot to be desired .
a sad , sad , sad experience .
i had the chicken tenders basket instead .
it seriously tasted just like burger king tenders .
nothing special about this place anymore ... .
terrible .
i will not be back , as there are better alternatives in the neighborhood .
how far the mighty has fallen !
the names on the menus are ridiculous .
this being the burger i had was n't awful ... dry .
but not awful .
fried pickles were standard but good .
now it just seems like a bland cookie cutter restaurant .
and turn the lights down .
so we ate _num_ bites total and asked to take it off the bill .
now , not so much .
what the hell happened ?
so sad !
the prices are a bit higher ( but not too high ) .
if you did , join me in pouring one out .
oh so disappointed .
i had not been back to the penguin since it closed .
a mistake .
there were only three other tables with people .
really very sad .
unfortunately that is not true .
also the service was mediocre and way over priced for the quality of food .
there are so many better burger joints in town .
save your self a bad meal and walk around the corner .
visit the diamond for the penguin goodies now .
writing this review breaks my heart .
i have raved and raved about the penguin and been there several times .
this time however was a big disappointment .
it was n't super crowded for one and the menu was significantly smaller .
i was disgusted .
so sad ... .
unfortunately for the server though apt ... we agreed not to leave any gratuity .
his answers of _num_ minutes turned into _num_ hours .
gross !
fried to die for .
do n't be fooled , this place is nothing special !
had a bbq sand and was nothing but disappointed .
why would anyone go out other their was to do a fried pickle ?
sadly , a shadow of its former self .
the meat was dry and overdone , and flavor was ... lacking .
my fries were way too cool ( almost cold ) and lacked salt .
what 's worse is that the ambiance is totally gone .
it 's still the same building , but the servers lack tattoos .
the `` new '' penguin is neither .
i am extremely disappointed and i do n't give one star reviews lightly !
when we came in , i was excited about this place .
egg , mozzarella cheese & mayo .
i 'll get there , do n't you worry .
good thing i like onions i guess .
i just ate the burger and did n't say anything at first .
she did n't even mix it up or anything .
i did n't want to feel that way two days in a row .
ugh .
this place is sure to disappoint .
it was too expensive for what it was , especially considering the service .
after reading reviews more closely , we will try diamond next time instead .
`` almost anywhere '' would have been a good answer .
the sandwich was n't even on the menu anymore .
the burgers were a bit dry and the onion rings were flavorless .
i did like the african hotdog , but the chili kind of ruined it .
very disappointed in this restaurant .
we stopped in around 2pm on a saturday hoping to have a good time .
unfortunately , the food fell short of mediocre .
our food showed up cold and was not good .
i unfortunately understand why .
there were only _num_ people here .
this was _num_ % miss for us .
just like some other people have said its just not what it was .
when i recently went there everything about the restaurant was off putting .
the whole restaurant was dark and empty .
i walked in no one greeted me .
ca n't believe this place has been featured on several food shows .
i make better fried pickles at home .
unfortunately it was an awful experience this afternoon for lunch .
it was a rip off .
the burger was mediocre , slightly dry and nothing spectacular .
spend less on a better burger elsewhere !
poor penguin , my how the mighty have fallen .
ok , so it was 9:30 on a monday .
i have no clue how the place is still open .
no food and only two other customers .
the staff was friendly , that is the only redeeming factor .
unfortunately without food to choose from , we ended up going elsewhere for dinner .
we finally left with no service whatsoever .
if they can get their act together , i may try this place again .
otherwise , do n't waste your time .
she was nice , but the food is horrible .
i had a hard time putting this mess in my mouth .
with patties that bad , toppings do n't matter .
the coleslaw was not good .
the only thing that was actually good was the penguin sauce .
a few of us from my office went to the penguin for lunch .
when we received our food , it was nothing like we had ordered !
the fried pickles were thicker , not breaded enough , not fried enough .
toppings unremarkable .
terrible patties .
overall service bad , restaurant empty .
the small block at the diamond is the burger i fell in love with .
sub fried pickles for your side of fries ?
burger cooked anything but medium well ?
no way !
between the three of us we tried a couple burgers and a chicken salad .
not sure what all the hype is about .
the service was efficient - no complaints .
no special tasty to any of it .
i was informed that the original owners moved to a different location .
first impressions were not good to start with .
the bathrooms are gross and they have a condiment squeeze bottle for the soap .
this was after waiting over an hour for hamburgers and hotdogs !
ridiculous !
it was gross and very disappointing .
if you look closely , there is a _num_ cent charge for water .
extra sauces are $ _num_ ( pricey in my opinion ) .
sodas and tea are $ _num_ ( more expensive than a beer ) .
in the same conversation , they asked for the check as well .
he dropped our check , took our money and then disappeared for _num_ minutes .
our waiter also got a _num_ % tip as well .
Negative
it 's harder to repair a negative visit than it is to prevent one .
the invoice was not comped either .
drinks were not refilled timely .
she just offered to cancel them , so we did and left .
we did n't even get to try the fried pickles .
not worth it .
_num_ of the _num_ people had incorrect food ( i.e .
first of all , burgers have buns , not toasted white bread .
_num_ out of _num_ orders were wrong toppings .
what the hell has this place become ?
well i was very disappointed with our visit here .
wo n't be back , the apps were good but not worthy the trouble .
literally _num_ hours .
the saving grace was they could n't find our ticket so was free .
but the food ... was greasy and gross .
soooo disappointed !
took some friends who had never been and it was terrible !
service was terrible !
cooks looked like they were cooking but no food was going to tables !
they didnt even comp our apps or club sodas for the long wait !
i first went to the penguin in _num_ and it was awesome .
alas , time has not been kind to the penguin .
going to the penguin will just leave you disappointed .
this place needs someone to go in , take over and bring it back .
it could n't be in a more perfect neighborhood .
food- the burgers were overcooked , overpriced , and plain flavored .
save your money and your appetite for the other foodie places in clt .
it just is n't good anymore .
the food is n't as good .
first time here & it was horrible .
over _num_ minutes to take our food order even though we were ready .
horrible service !
half of the staff walked out of the place while we were sitting there .
guess i 'll give it _num_ star since i ca n't give any less .
this is surely not the same penguin that was featured on two tv shows .
service was the worse i 've ever experienced .
probably did n't have the a/c on since they 're not making money .
watched _num_ groups of people walked out since no server acknowledged them .
when our food finally arrived it was missing our appetizers .
turns out they did n't even start making them .
as bad as food gets .
both were awful .
they were soggy and very salty , absolutely horrible .
the servers were nice , but the food is just that bad .
what a disappointing lunch !
it used to be hard to get a seat in there .
a hotdog , small fry and drink was over $ _num_ .
none of the items were particularly good .
i did n't even care to finish any item ordered .
despite having an office right up the street , i wo n't be returning .
it 's not the same place .
want the classic penguin ?
just tried the famous kitchen burger , was very disappointed .
took forever and was not worth waiting for .
she did not introduce herself and she clearly did not want to be there .
she seemed annoyed that we were n't ready to place our full order .
i was in awe that a server could be so blatantly rude .
she had the worst attitude of any server i have ever seen .
this is the worst mcdonalds i have ever been too !
the staff is rude and the order is never right .
the absolute worst .
went there tonight around _num_ am and was told it was cash only .
when i visit a mcdonald 's restaurant , my expectations ate the same .
the bread was stale and the chicken was cold .
unfortunately , some of the food was not .
my fries were cold !
not warm ... cold !
it also took for ever before we got our check which was truly annoying .
on the positive note , the food was cheap .
wrong .
after sitting for _num_ hour and _num_ mins and no food , we left .
spoke to three people in their and none of them were happy .
the fried pickles are exactly the same as the penguin 's .
, my order was wrong & they forgot part of another order .
another 15-20 minutes pass and we still ca n't pay .
the waitress was slow and dumb .
i wo n't go out of my way for it ever again .
seriously , this restaurant needs to start over .
the service was the worse i have ever experienced .
i would have complained , but the waitress never returned to check on us .
the fried pickles we ordered also arrived at room temperature .
i 'll miss the food and ambiance of the old diamond .
it was worse .
not pleased .
not impressed .
i was very disappointed with my experience .
while this may be a local legend it was underwhelming .
i also had a few bites of the fried pickles .
mac & cheese was moist and cheesy and acceptable .
cream squash was omg kinda not good .
waitress was n't too friendly at all .
so far i 've been disappointed by most of them .
my girlfriend was disappointed with her spaghetti .
i ca n't say as the burger was that bad .
as for the hot dog , well it was a hot dog .
everything about this place is average to me .
my food was decent , but my gf hated her food .
`` wo n't get fooled again !
if you 're looking for penguin _num_ , do n't be fooled .
i have been _num_ times and have been let down _num_ times .
service was fast but not overly friendly .
the meat was thin cut and not high quality .
on to the food - i ordered wings and fried pickles .
the fried pickles were good - the wings were not .
they were chewy , not spicy and dry .
very disappointed in my last two trips to the diamond .
so embarrassed i suggested it for our lunch group .
what a disappointment .
mediocre , overpriced food .
i ordered take-out recently from the diamond through living social .
ok , no problem .
it was 6:30pm after all , dinner rush .
my experience was n't the greatest , but also was n't the worst .
the fries were horrible !
the deal breaker for me is that the place is just dirty .
i understand it 's an old building but it could use some tlc inside .
ate there tonight for the first time .
the wait staff had major attitude and were down right rude .
i am not sure what happened in the following months .
not sure how that is possible for a place that was just redone completely .
basically all fluff and no substance .
i really , really want to like the diamond .
it 's cheap , convenient to my house , and my friends like it .
unfortunately , the diamond ca n't manage cooking scrambled eggs .
they came out rubbery and overdone both times .
no herbs , no parmesan , nothing extra at all .
all in all it was a bland experience , both times .
fried chicken was a little greasy and dry .
left food on the table , paid and walked out .
she spilled drinks and did n't bother to clean them up !
we had fried pickles which were fantastic , as expected !
$ _num_ for poor service and incredibly mediocre food .
the patio was completely open at the diamond with only one couple sitting outside .
finally a server came out to check on the other table .
ma 'm '' she completely ignored me .
another _num_ minutes went by .
i had probably been there _num_ min .
by this time i really did n't feel like eating .
needless to say , the diamond wo n't see any more of my business .
which is really sad .
i realize that this is supposed to be a charlotte classic .
but the food is simply disgusting .
i 'm not sure there was any onion in there .
it was more like i was eating hard chunks of over fried breading .
skinny , way overcooked patties .
and there was no flavor .
the pitas seemed stale rather than the claimed `` toasted '' .
this hummus looked like something out of `` two girls , one cup '' .
it was not possible to dip one of the stale pitas into it .
the stale pita broke .
i stuck my knife into the `` hummus '' and let go .
it just stood there standing straight up .
first off , my chicken and greens were luke warm .
to which to server said , '' yeah , just serve him whatever . ''
what i really would 've appreciated was fresh chicken .
the chicken i received was cold and tasteless .
a little salt and pepper goes a long way .
however , the mac and cheese made up for it by being over seasoned .
i tipped my server something like $ _num_ on $ _num_ , and left .
i will not be back , ever .
maybe you can fool all the hipsters , but you ca n't fool me .
i 've been wanting to try the diamond for years .
i probably wo n't be coming back .
and i doubt i would ever recommend the diamond to anyone .
did not even include a side dish with the meal .
crust was the only part worth eating .
disappointing since this place used to serve quality food all the time .
normally great ... but things have been going down hill .
will try again though bc i enjoyed my tuna melt sandwich and fried pickles .
reminds me of terrible cafeteria food i ate in grade school .
the service has always been slow .
consider traveling here only after being drunk .
just seems not sanitary .
not complicated this late .
so obviously diamond does n't care about their customers anymore .
the food was disappointing as well .
but because of my experience i refuse to go back .
after eating that oysters i was excited to get my entree .
i ordered a philly , my girlfriend ordered a burger .
we figured it was a simple mistake and brushed it off .
my girlfriends burger tasted like crap and was way over cooked .
the veggies were wilted and watery .
i was beyond upset and no longer had an appetite .
i do n't care if it 's late night or not .
why is zero stars not possible ?
friday night , not terribly busy .
_num_ minutes later , stopped host to ask for drinks .
another _num_ minutes , host took our drink order .
another _num_ minutes , asked host about drinks .
told `` i 'm not your server , sorry . ''
have been coming here for years , but will never be back .
absolutely the worst service i have ever received anywhere , anytime .
food was decent but i waited _num_ minutes for a grilled cheese sandwich !
i have received poor service and poor food both times i have been here .
i tried to give them a second chance but the service is so slow .
really good food , however every time we go the service is terrible .
they are either really slow or have an attitude .
the fries were not fried right , the gravy on the fries was bland .
the first burger attempted to be delivered was not what we ordered at all .
the delivered burger was also bland .
not the place for a good burger and fries .
not at all impressed ... .
we were halfway greeted at the door and the server was extremely rude .
he asked me for my drink and then did n't even ask my friend .
she had to yell out what she wanted .
i know they were busy , but that was ridiculous .
i definitely wo n't be going back .
the spaces were n't clearly marked and cars were parked wherever they could fit .
the waitress was friendly and quickly took our order .
gross !
i did n't enjoy them at all .
she never even mentioned the fries again .
she just gave us the check .
we paid and left but overall we felt a little disappointed by our visit .
everything else pretty much was unimpressive .
rarely is it a place that i choose to go .
with few exceptions the food doesnt do too much for me .
for some reason the fried pickles do n't even taste as good .
fries were soggy and soft and bland also .
i pushed my plate away and the bartender took it back to the kitchen .
only upon returning from the kitchen did he ask whether i want anything different .
no thanks .
so disappointed .
to my disappointment , my burger was also extremely over cooked and dry .
the hot dog was ok but the chili was a bit salty .
i could n't believe it .
not impressed tried to go for lunch they sat us down and forgot us .
only attempted to take our order after we got up to leave .
wow this place has gone downhill .
i do n't have high expectations for a diner .
walked in with a buddy at 8:30 on a friday night .
waitress approached after about _num_ minutes to take our drink order .
pickles came out about _num_ minutes later .
how long does it take to fry some damn pickles ?
waitress did n't take our order until we were halfway done with the pickles .
meanwhile tables who were seated after us were already eating .
we ate because we were hungry , but i will not be back .
you 'll be sitting there waiting a while for your order to come out .
then when you do get your food , it 'll be cold .
the booths are very uncomfortable and extremely close to the table .
this place would serve the community better by being torn down .
i would not give any stars , but that was n't an option .
i had a burger w/ fries and my friend had a blt w/ fries .
sorry if our business was too much of a hassle for you .
walked in and ignored by both the bar tender and the server .
their backyard is to die for .
joey ... the waiter ... sucks .
it 's 2pm on a tuesday ... i 'm here at lunch .
he was in a horrible mood .
why would we want a server like that ?
they 've never met .
but i did stay and ordered the philly cheesesteak with fries .
the fries were fresh and hot .
it 's not that hard for a diner to buy a damn dishwasher .
i do n't understand this place .
this is a horrible representation of a deli .
five thumbs down for this hole in the wall .
i 'd rather go play a friends living room than play this place .
bad neighborhood .
difficult to park .
they do n't serve liquor or anything else besides beer and wine .
it was lame .
i really do n't understand all the _num_ star reviews for this place .
i wo n't be back .
sub-par ingredients , all the sauces now taste almost exactly the same .
it is a real shame .
the rice looked like it had been cooked in mud , the day before .
the sauce flavor was a little off to me too .
it just seemed like everything was not quite good .
this wo n't be our go-to .
so disappointed ... .
Neutral
the employees attitude is so negative .
food is n't as good as it used to be either .
i ate it and i did n't die .
however i was really disappointed with the lack of attention paid to the interior .
very disappointed that they do n't vacuum .
they may as well not even bother .
i will not take my car here again .
the actual car wash was fine , nothing too special or spectacular .
it was pretty affordable , but the service could have been better .
you should really just wash your car yourself .
what a waste of money .
will not be confused back .
the food : just not bueno for me .
the sauce tasted canned and the ravioli were essentially tasteless .
needless to say , i left gus 's sir beef hungry and disappointed .
gus ... oh , gus .
hmm ... not this place , the outside matches the inside unfortunately .
but in all reality the food was just not what it probably once was .
not for the food .
got take out here recently and it was not very good .
bland and tasteless .
not worth it .
sat for _num_ minutes without menus and drink order taken .
count me in , right ?
on the three occasions i 've visited , the staff have always been curt .
dairy queen can be so hit & miss .
: / it packs in the people though .
i did n't know the difference .
i had no need to worry though because this dq is consistently subpar .
it 's not the lack of seating .
it 's not the long lines .
the problem is that the ice cream is soupy .
this is a consistent problem in fall and summer .
the owners need to fix their machines because they have lost a customer !
first off , i want to say that i 've been here multiple times .
recently , i went there with my boyfriend .
it was a total disaster .
tonight we drove out of our way to go enjoy a last minute dessert .
a big disappointment .
cole slaw was flavorless .
very underwhelming ... .
not quite sure why the onions rings are famous .
the food was very disappointing !
i have been to the other location in matthews and it tasted much better .
i was sad because this place is closer to me .
will not be back .
my experience inside this branch was so-so .
which i knew i had not .
my last interaction at this branch was beyond frustrating .
it was n't that they could not .
most of the tellers are extremely rude .
i feel like it 's too much .
this is the worst food lion i have been to .
what makes this the worst ?
but the final straw was when i purchased breakfast sausage this past sunday .
it was so bad i almost got sick .
this was not expired .
it was so bad i could not take it back to the store .
customer service did give me my money back .
now i am going out of my way to do my shopping .
really disappointing considering we order from here very often .
wrong .
yeah , i figured wrong .
where was the bowl ?
grits grits everywhere , because these grits were on the soupy side .
needless to say i gained weight just looking at them .
sadly , the gyro was mediocre .
the meat had little flavor and was dry .
what really got me was that the gyro sandwich was served as a platter .
our service was lackluster , at best , borderline surly at worst .
i ordered _num_ eggs over easy with toast , bacon , and fries .
after all , how bad can a plate of fries be ?
as it turns out , pretty bad .
like our service , they seemed lackluster , bored .
all in all it was a lackluster diner and dining experience .
just do n't order the fries .
it was terrible i will never go here again .
how can you mess up a simple cheeseburger and chicken finger ?
i was disappointed to say the least .
but landmark needs to step it up .
_num_ eggs over medium , sausage patties and french toast .
french toast some battered and some not .
sausage patties ?
they gave me one order and they were way overcooked .
the waiter had only about _num_ other tables and she already looked busy .
what kind of restaurant requires you to pay extra to share ?
very disappointed in this place .
maybe it is only good at 3am .
do not go here for gyros .
the owner came to our table and really showed is butt off .
the bread was stale and cold .
definitely disappointed and will not return .
the chicken tenders were cooked too long until they were hard and inedible .
the stuffed baked potato was served burned and blackened .
the fish sandwich was terrible .
would n't eat there again although it was n't terrible .
worst service i 've ever gotten here !
horrible service , had to ask server four times for silverware .
requested cocktail sauce , received barbecue sauce .
fish sandwich was full of bones and served on a stale bun .
very disappointing .
it was n't until it was over that the experience became a bad one .
shame shame shame , did i say shame ?
shame on you landmark , update your menu , decor and bathrooms .
none of the food was above average , and some was certainly sub-par .
we wo n't be going back .
one had a philly cheese steak sandwich which was totally flavorless .
another had beef tips over rice that tasted like uncle ben 's rice .
all this and a waitress with a crappy attitude .
sorry landmark ... time for us to find another `` go to '' place .
so when i visited this past week , this was my first stop .
i was so disappointed .
as soon as you walk in you an tell that the atmosphere has changed .
the staff is not as friendly .
two of us ordered the italian trio .
it was awful !
it was cold and tasteless .
i guess the other customers do n't count .
that was way back when they were good .
i was not impressed at all .
i ordered buffalo chicken wings with ranch & cheese grits .
the buffalo wing sauce was not good at all .
it was very salty with a bad after taste .
the ranch was bland so it did n't mask the bad sauce taste .
no would you like a desert ?
there are hundreds of restaurants in charlotte pick another one with descent service !
all around disappointing .
place was crazy busy with the after church crowd .
it just continues to go downhill from there .
empty water glass , and the list goes on .
our breakfasts took _num_ minutes to arrive .
food was hot , but mediocre at best .
i wo n't be coming back .
check them out for yourself and see what you think .
crappy job , and crappy customer service in response to the eggs .
do n't accept poor service !
it was not packed and we waited about 3-5 minutes to be seated .
he was clueless and just stood there with his mouth hanging open .
my husband was grabbing his jacket and coming out behind me .
no wait , i bet she did n't eat it .
in fact , i will bet no one ate it , whatever it was .
drove almost _num_ mins from home to here to eat .
i did n't feel like late night fast food so i picked this spot .
website says it 's open for another hour and _num_ minutes .
girl washing the window says they close at 1am .
i would n't have driven _num_ mins if it had said otherwise .
_num_ .
needs remodeling , cuts in the seats and i mean big ones .
_num_ .
cooks do n't remember what you order .
_num_ .
our server was n't really friendly at all .
i ordered a western omelet and it was not good at all .
that was the worst omelet i 've ever had .
i was very disappointed .
hours of their business are wrong .
terribly disappointing .
ribeye steak sandwich was tasteless .
i did n't waste time on that garbage .
husband had a hot roast beef sandwich .
roast beef was tough .
service is slow .
checkout is ridiculous .
we had terrible service .
the service is horrible and the food is not good anymore .
the week prior we ordered take out salads and they were not well prepared .
no , greeter lady .
i ca n't spare any change .
this used to be my be my neighborhood go-to for all consumer goods .
just make sure you check the date on the package .
questionable cleanliness .
there are just too many stinky smells in here .
i left with an upset stomach .
the vegetables are wilted and look old .
will not be returning .
but , do n't take your pride and joy to these people .
employees were aware of this but did not seem to be very concerned .
so gross .
the food was terrible and burnt .
i just got finished eating two bites and i threw the whole thing away .
the building itself is disgusting and filthy .
the windows are covered in a nasty film .
this place needs to be torn down immediately .
so no more cravings for church 's chicken .
craving has been satisfied .
the service was not that great however hubby and i love the chicken .
okay every cashier gets my order wrong .
two more parties of black people walk in after me .
been twice , both times they messed up my order .
skipping forward two months i went on sunday and ordered the chicken tender special .
bad news , folks .
i got lost among their products and i wanted to buy and try everything .
we ordered the veggie plate and tried all _num_ different sides .
the spinach pastry was hard and difficult to eat .
the staff were very friendly and the seating area was clean .
the lamb though was not really seasoned and tasted like boiled meat .
they also tucked dill pickles into the thing which tasted strange to me .
i love this middle eastern food , but this was a disappointing meal .
greedy people .
do n't waste money and time .
it was pathetic .
these people really need to hire competent employees if they want business .
multiple horrible experiences from this location !
the location is falling apart , door handle literally hanging off .
one word ... nasty .
i tried this place and i was highly disappointed .
the sandwich however was terrible .
i wo n't go back .
very disappointed and have not even had a lesson yet .
i 've been trying _num_ weeks to schedule a lesson .
i can not return the groupon because i 'm pass the _num_ day mark .
incredibly disappointed .
its like they are mixing two recipes , chinese vegetable in the salad dish .
stick to the pho if you go , just beware if you msg allergies .
it 's not even up to par .
i had immediately lost my appetite .
one look at the glass door and i knew this restaurant was not clean .
the biggest mistake i made was going to the restroom .
absolutely disgusting and clearly is never serviced .
i will not be back .
the service is horrible .
did n't even apologize .
not recommending .
i would pick zero stars if i could .
they did n't even offer to cover my oil change .
dishonest practices !
i went here yesterday and they did not pass my car over ridiculous things .
do n't go here dishonest practices !
but the prices kill it for me .
first , the place is under new management and the renovations are awesome .
unfortunately , i thought dinner would be the same and it was borderline terrible .
i 've been a loyal customer for more than _num_ years .
_num_ ) , this place is tucked behind an italian restaurant for good reason .
the buffet is small and bland .
i tried the sesame chicken ; they used dark meat chicken !
i ca n't understand how this place remains open .
do n't waste your time here .
this place is awful .
nothing else needs to be said .
i wish i could give it _num_ stars .
this place is bad enough to warrant a post .
it 's just a horrible spot overall .
do not waste your time or money .
worst chinese buffett i have ever had !
the broth did not have the home made authentic taste to it .
feels fake .
the chilli paste on the table is too oily .
_num_ , so its a low b at that .
i was very disappointed .
horrible experience .
Neutral
i wish i could give negative stars .
worst service ever .
my experience after i walked out of the store was terrible .
it was awful .
i was so mad and let them know .
they also told me that the legs would n't arrive until saturday .
so i called the customer care center again .
so thursday morning comes around , no phone call the guy shows up .
_num_ minutes !
some of the worst customer service i have ever received .
i spent $ _num_ on delivery and it was a joke .
not even a sorry .
she is rude , unprofessional , disrespectful and incompetent .
my overall experience with this store was horrible .
very slow and inefficient .
i too went the first time based on a recommendation .
not anymore due to our last takeout order .
bad .
no thank you .
wrong .
where 's the garbage ?
okay , this is a hard one .
not nasty but not what i expected .
if only another hibachi option was close to this one !
worst sushi i have ever had even if it was for $ _num_ .
i was a little skeptical about ordering anything .
chicken had no flavor and looked like it was a week old .
as others have said , decor and location are horrible .
the salad was n't really fresh but the ginger dressing was passable .
the chicken teriyaki is n't bad .
cons : their customer service was weak at best .
never said hello , thank you , etc .
the salad did n't taste very fresh either .
the decor is nothing to write home about .
i waited and i sure enough paid $ _num_ twice for one meal .
never going back !
do n't waste your time .
the place has a new greedy owner .
closed & the shopping center has been torn down .
i ca n't understand all the positive reviews about this place .
because of the great reviews , i went there recently .
the fish on display were in ice was mostly melted .
no gel polish , gel top coat ?
so i just wanted to put the red flag on customer service .
terrible .
hated the whole atmosphere too .
gave her exactly $ _num_ and will never go there again .
trash .
i would strongly recommend not wasting your time or money with this establishment .
customer service is something this salon definitely lacks !
a plain spicy chicken combo with a pepsi .
i was offered a shot glass sized frosty for my trouble .
this has got to be the worst wendy 's in charlotte .
do n't usually eat fast food .
_num_ minutes later myself and _num_ other people are still waiting for our orders .
seems very disorganized .
this is the worst wendy 's in charlotte !
do not give this location your money .
worst wendy 's ever .
employees are always rude , food takes forever .
unbelievable how little the employees care about customers .
it was my birthday so thought i would get myself some treats .
for the best tres leches , go to viva chicken .
it looked pretty but it was too soggy .
is there an option for _num_ stars ?
this is the worst place .
what the hell !
also the people around there are scum , too .
renovation does not hide the fact that this complex is still garbage .
ca n't wait to move out .
i am only giving them one star because i ca n't give them zero .
not to mention that we have called the front office several times .
stay away from these apartments .
this new management is the worst thing to happen to this place .
spoke to management about that too - still no response .
every time i turn my shower on , i 'm greeted by rusty water .
because other than the staff , the place was nearly empty .
i went with a gyro instead .
valentines dinner .
no big deal my child was in the restroom .
he just took the plate and cup and never wiped up the spilled tea .
so my review is low and i will not go back .
worst pizza .
the pizza was soggy and bland .
no quality here ... .
i called in a supreme pizza and they said _num_ minutes .
the pizza was soft , doughy , and basically inedible .
i wo n't be back .
they charge $ _num_ for ranch .
so i said ok no problem he got me .
hey keep your ranch !
you can wait _num_ minutes or leave . ''
we chose to leave and wo n't be back .
during the last several years , this restaurant has been in slow decline .
$ _num_ for a dozen wings ( not full wings , but pieces ) .
pasta ( bolognese ) was very bitter .
meatballs : $ _num_ .
coke was flat , asked for a replacement of sweet tea .
i expected similar food and ambience , was let down .
would n't come back to this location for sure .
it 's just a shame that they were n't fresh .
honestly there is no excuse for that .
i have never been treated so badly in my whole life .
my food was gross , poorly cooked and soggy .
just do not ever go to this location , you will be sorry .
my biggest issue is : no dressing rooms ?
for what it is , its expensive and the owner is a jerk .
he was not allowed to even get a drink .
we immediately got thrown out .
i will never be back .
do n't be fooled by this places high rating .
boring !
for my brother $ _num_ .
the salon is located in a pretty run down area .
you can imagine the horror i felt .
sorry j & s .
inconsistent much ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
there is no volume on the tvs .
_num_ .
_num_ .
there are no windows with views outside .
_num_ .
the building was hot and uncomfortable and the staff was less than hospitable .
i would suggest you skip this place .
they obviously do n't stand behind their work so i will not be back .
i did n't find anything i found to be spectacular here .
that was after _num_ minutes .
i was seated immediately , ordered steak and eggs promptly .
it was mainly empty despite being a saturday .
mistake # _num_ .
the burger was flavorless and dry .
secondly , we asked for our fries to be cooked crispy .
does no one in charlotte know how to make crispy french fries ?
besides the onion rings i 'm not sure how this place has any business .
generic food and the server acted annoyed we were even there .
it really was that awful .
terrible !
sad that i 'll have to look for another practitioner .
i 've had such a terrible experience .
i would not wish on my worst enemy .
you absolutely can not be in water after the water breaks .
you can not move around during active labor .
i highly suggest you find another practice .
you absolutely can not be in water after the water breaks .
you can not move around during active labor .
she is no longer with the practice .
it 's gross .
downright disgusting .
sadly , the place has gone downhill in a big way .
i miss the doctors who delivered both of my children .
it 's quick and easy and not too expensive .
but keep your head down and that wo n't matter much .
these were terrible .
i could n't eat it .
after passing this little place for years i stopped for a late breakfast .
prices are dirt low and the food is basic diner fare .
my low score comes simply from a lack of investment into the property .
wrong !
the fries were stale and tasted freezer burnt .
the burger was a hot mess and tasted off .
the mother was extremely rude and particular unhelpful .
overall , a totally creepy experience .
valid for the next day only .
there were so many displays that were n't finished , or not up .
this is not a fair business practice .
the sweet and sour chicken and sesame chicken are both dry and chewy .
which is why this restaurant gets a `` no ! ''
gross ... that 's pretty much all i have to say about it .
it may be cheap , but there is a reason for that .
worst food i have had in a long time .
every part of it was terrible .
two apps and two entrees , all really bad .
it took me over _num_ minutes to place my order .
the meal was very greasy & the rice and egg roll were so over-cooked .
wo n't bother again .
i 've had it -- i will not eat here again .
do not order any dish with breaded chicken .
ginger chicken is the dish to get if you find yourself here .
there was very little amounts of chicken in the orange chicken .
rice was good , dumplings were nothing special .
never received the champagne .
the food arrived and was just ok .
but i could totally see this place featured on fox kitchen nightmares .
maybe he should have sent the `` male cousin '' over !
but the experience was less than ideal .
but what i got was overcooked , dry chicken and very bland stuffing .
so she probably would give a different rating for this restaurant .
but i wo n't be going back .
what can i say other than this place just plain stinks .
i usually do not give _num_ star ratings but this place had it coming .
first of all the waitstaff were very snooty and unfriendly .
the steaks came out cooked identical , both were cooked well done .
i was beginning to think they were trying to tell us to leave .
they squeezed us at a small table which our bread and appetizer barely fit .
the waiter was ok but rarely checked back .
the sauce had so much meat and was heavy sausage tasting .
it did n't taste good either .
there must be better italian in charlotte .
i will have some problems for the rest of my life .
i would suggest avoiding this doctor unless you are a man .
this organization lacks communication , follow-up , and engaged patient to doctor care .
this has been a very disappointing experience .
i will pay anything but when the food is nasty .
if the food was not so terrible .
lack of freshness .
parm tuscan chicken had too much sauce but good flavor .
mac n cheese tasted processed as well .
i would not recommend this place unfortunately .
however , i 've only gone once .
i strongly suggest not going to this practice .
the office staff is incredibly rude and inappropriate .
i am not a fan of this store .
the main reason is the hygiene concerns .
i do n't know why many people like it .
no reply .
guess they do n't need my business .
they will randomly leave out at least one item every trip .
i have bought several of your prepared food items .
they have all been very disappointing .
the kid at the counter is explaining to be how frozen ravioli is better .
unbelievable .
very disappointed in this place .
went here with high hopes , left disappointed .
as you walk inside you gets welcomed by the garlic smell .
i was offered many things but bought just the focaccia which was terrible .
i am yet to find a truly italian market in charlotte .
turns out , i could n't have been more wrong .
as an adult , though , it really did n't feel like my scene .
do n't get me wrong .
enter with low expectations and be surprised on occasion .
fyi , our money is green too !
however , he no longer works at this office .
he might as well have been a character from a dark comedy .
_num_ minutes later , someone finally came to assist us .
so another _num_ minutes to an hour later -- he finally came .
pretty sure i know that if she eats a peanut , she might die .
someone tell me how you get out of paying for a useless appointment ?
waiting for an hour and a half for _num_ minutes of wasted time ...
the # _num_ negative is their billing .
it 's horrible .
went there for a horrible allergic reaction .
this was a _num_ month follow up visit for my _num_ year old daughter .
a simply routine visit as she is not having any problems .
called back to exam room in _num_ minutes or so .
we waited another _num_ minutes and still nothing .
even the nurses were standing around doing nothing .
Negative
this place deserves negative stars .
i just did n't get a good feeling from him at all .
overall the service was at best mediocre , and that 's generous .
as for our food again there was n't much better .
the arugula and spinach salad was drenched in oil .
the food was ok - good but the service was terrible .
my husband had to get up to get our own fresh ground pepper .
never smiled , did n't know how to describe the restaurant she works at .
her reply , `` i do n't know , good question . ''
one of my ( tiny -- hello ?
this should n't have been hard ! )
charlotte dentistry stood out .
the dentist was rude .
she insisted the chart said _num_ .
all the work was finished at the pediatric dentist .
if my teeth do n't turn out right this will be a problem .
i felt really sick .
cut that cost me $ _num_ .
miserable experience .
the assistant manager spoke down to me and treated me like i was stupid .
she did nothing to help me or the situation .
it was so bad i left in tears and will never go back .
how awful can one place be ?
_num_ ) asking them a question is a non starter .
the store , overall , looks dated .
worst pharmacy ever .
always rude , employees are lazy .
the worst .
just awful customer service .
this place sucks .
it is so horrible .
the pizza is decent , but delivery is an epic failure .
bad process and bad employees who lied twice times .
pizza maybe , technology no .
this place is awful .
they ruined my boyfriend 's gorgeous hair .
the `` open '' light in the window was switched off .
neither one attempted to communicate with me .
guess they do n't want business ?
that was just rude .
some haircuts are great , some are really bad .
too bad i even have to give this place a star .
i had to immediately place this review as i love total wine .
little to my surprise she contacted me back , extremely disappointed .
i hate the place !
the customer service is horrible .
its a joke big box store blowing smoke .
the woman told me it would be over $ _num_ to clean !
these owners do n't care about any of their customers .
needless to say we will never be back !
under the new management ( starting in _num_ ?
do not go to this cleaners !
be careful -- i do not think that man is stable !
so frustrating and unbelievable .
he looked at it and then went over to get the batteries for me .
while he was messing around with one remote , i changed the other .
so time to pay and he tells me $ _num_ .
whoa , really ?
you 're kidding me , right ?
found the same watch batteries at lower from $ _num_ less .
not my thing , but sports pubs never are .
not my favorite place .
but the service leaves something to be desired .
they were n't taken off until we asked for the check .
service is aweful due to management not scheduling enough servers .
there was a female bartender with glasses who was extremely rude .
an irish pub that does n't serve anything irish ?
thats cause it was all frozen and deep fried .
home of the weak drink .
ridiculous .
waste of money .
stick with beer or wine .
i do n't know how they keep repeat customers .
_num_ .
wanted to get a bite to eat however , no silverware .
really , no clean silverware ?
service here is slow ( i was warned by friends before coming here . )
people are n't very friendly here .
i had a terrible experience here last night .
it was my second time here , first time ordering food .
worst service i 've ever received anywhere in my life .
no apology .
this place was so utterly terrible i wo n't be back .
did i mention that the price was _num_ what a big let down .
some employees are not friendly at all .
may be one of the worst hit cuts i have ever had .
safe to say i will not be back .
we 'd had high hopes for the butterfly atrium and were somewhat disappointed .
it is well maintained but feels old and in need of some love .
the ethiopian restaurant we went to afterwards though -- now that was worth it .
i do not recommend this museum .
cake i ordered tasted so bad that i threw it away .
the icing was disgusting .
i paid a $ _num_ deposit with a card over the phone .
we were completely disappointed .
last year , the cake was dry .
i will not go back for a 3rd year in a row .
unfortunately , i will never purchase beer from this place again .
that 's just horrible customer service , and i will never return .
horrible customer service !
not one _num_ pack but one bottle .
what on earth am i going to do with _num_ bottle of beer ?
disappointing .
and a bad visit today stops me from coming back .
owner is so arrogant that he does not appreciate long term customers .
i am sorely disappointed at the owner being so arrogant to me today .
for this reason i will not be back .
condescending staff and owner , mike needs some work on his customer service .
the worst michael 's in charlotte .
the employees know nothing and the manager does n't know anything either .
disappointed with the service i received .
instead i was completely underwhelmed .
so-so to gross ingredients , edible but barely .
will not be going back here .
i wish that was all i ordered .
i will only be ordering wings from now on .
the flavor was okay but too salty soy for my liking .
the sweet potato mash was dark in color and kind of bland in taste .
the corn bread was just okay .
that way i know that they would truly get the tip .
the squash casserole was okay , but not great .
most of my _num_ $ lunch ended up in the trash .
mediocre .
and , boy was i disappointed .
i also ordered the chicken soft taco and chips .
the taco , i have had better .
we wanted something fast and good before heading to the airport early .
the chicken was dry , the rice had parts that were not completely cooked .
the new potatoes and squash casserole were decent .
if i lived here i would only return for beer .
very bland food , no flavor .
will not be return .
good flavor , but the dumplings were runny and ruined the entire experience .
would i try it again ?
probably not , but i can see some potential .
good food but lately poor execution .
two _num_ '' chicken rib bones .
food is good but service is terrible .
they are only friendly to customers they know .
maybe it was an off night , but we were pretty disappointed .
i ordered the rotisserie chicken with black beans & queso .
i went back up to get it which was fine .
the `` buttered '' spinach was awful , and the garlic potatoes were decent .
i 've had the monterey chicken wrap several times , and it never disappoints .
i went their recently and was very disappointed .
big mistake .
the food has no taste .
everything we ordered was watery and tasted like mystery mush .
even the stir fry veggies were bad -- how do you mess that up ?
i 'm not _num_ % sure what the hype is about .
admittedly , i did n't actually order any chicken .
my group and i had a hard time finding a clean table .
no response so i 'm leaving a review here for potential customers to see .
my wife was not acknowledged in any way .
after the employee returned with the shoe , my wife was then again ignored .
bottom line is she was super unprofessional and not very smart or helpful .
i really , really like wendy 's food .
this location is literally less than five minutes from my office .
instead of asiago chicken club , seems i have a standard spicy chicken sandwich .
no asiago cheese , no bacon .
makes me sad as i was already having a bad morning .
sorry wendy 's ( at least this location ) .
this wendy 's served me raw chicken .
do not eat at this location .
could n't find it anywhere .
- yes , its cheap .
- my gf said the turkey sausage tasted like soap .
bacon had a horrible aftertaste .
hashbrowns were barely cooked and were n't crisp at all .
the portions are large , yet the flavor is just ok .
outdated decor but lots of booths .
lots of greek and italian options in addition to the breakfast menu .
as for the food , everything was just okay .
food was cold and tasteless , service was extremely slow .
table next to us had the same issue , overheard them complaining .
not that the tzatziki sauce was rotten , it just was not tzatziki sauce .
the food was not good .
i ordered a chicken quesadilla , without the chicken , and some fries .
the quesadilla was mushy , tasteless with very little seasoning , and just bland .
it seems they lack food quality .
it just did n't come close to meeting my expectations .
my husband could not eat his cheeseburger as he said it was so overcooked .
i ordered the feta cheese omelette and was disappointed .
the egg was very dry and the omelette was broken in many places .
how does a pizza hut run out of garlic breadsticks & medium crust ?
this was probably the worst pizza experience i 've ever had .
it was very strange and i was surprised no one asked him to leave .
he looks confused and asks for my ticket .
he apologized and said again they were waiting on my wings .
no apology what so ever .
of course , its missing toppings and no pretzel crust as ordered .
the breading was burnt and all i could taste was burnt oil .
do n't waste your time or money here !
i ordered a skinny slice pizza with veggies on it .
make sure to check your pizza before the pizza man leaves .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
i do not know how they are staying in business .
wish i could give less than _num_ star .
worst pizza hut delivery experience ever .
was told order would be ready in _num_ minutes for pick up .
it 's saturday night at _num_ pm .
not cool , pizza hut .
not cool .
my only crime was asking for the meat to be replaced with beans .
this one was particularly bad .
of sour cream in it , and the rest was refried beans .
my order was $ _num_ for two items and a soda .
unfortunately , i made the decision of visiting this establishment tonight .
first off i did n't pay for my food .
so they get _num_ stars for letting that even happen .
however they messed up my order , minus _num_ star .
minus _num_ star .
slowest effing place known to man !
_num_ mins to get fast food .
are you kidding me ?
however ; my recent visit was a little disappointing .
um , no thanks .
then we added half of sun dried tomatoes .
not what i ordered .
the overall experience really left me with `` meh . ''
our initial greeting from the gentleman ( owner ?
in _num_ - _num_ minutes or so our pie came out ... wrong .
that 's all on us ... not complaining about that .
tres annoying .
_num_ ) the pizza was full of grease .
very little flavor and super bland .
i got ta say , we were disappointed .
i wanted to like the pizza , but it just was n't very good .
the crust was so thin it was soggy everywhere but the edges .
i guess we 'll have to start driving a little further for it .
very limited selection , but they were nice enough to take requests .
the pizza was amazingly thin , and the service was good at first .
however , the pizza itself did n't wow me .
i like thin pizza with an initial crunch then some chew to the crust .
nasty .
got sick .
do not recommend .
however , tonight 's visit will be our last .
it started the moment we walked in the door .
the restaurant was nearly empty ; only a couple of tables were occupied .
not a big deal , just loud when they hit the pizza stand .
that salad 's way too big for one cup of dressing .
in the same bored tone he used with my wife .
how could someone mess up a pizza ... beats me .
felt compelled , a week later , to share this pizza embarrassment ... .
a year and a half later and the service is still consistently horrible !
completely unacceptable in my opinion .
i dont need people to waste my time .
what is wrong with you people .
and larry what an ignorant fool insulting someone for his own experience .
while the store was clean and organized the selection and quality was dismal .
waited approximately _num_ minutes for her to finish with him .
i wanted a trim , i did n't need a trim .
i was promptly greeted and seated after the _num_ min wait .
not to mention the place is a disgusting shop .
go to the other one on south blvd instead of this shit hole .
i had no problem because i was just there for a trim .
after this experience i will never go there again .
it threw me off bangs for a long time !
i would leave zero stars if i could .
rude !
local outdoor store with a small selection of clothes and gear .
the selection for rock climbing gear was very limited .
it is so very very over priced .
also , the location is rather tough to get to .
not my favorite place .
if it were possible , i would not even give them a single star .
if it were possible , i would not even give them a single star .
so , i really do n't know how to feel about this place .
called today , monday , was told they did n't have the tires .
i 'm really not surprised because ... .
took my car in at _num_ am .
came back at 5:30 pm and the wheel was not replaced .
because the part they got was the wrong one .
after the car had been there for _num_ hours .
a few hours later , i was out the door .
but i will never come back to this location again .
i came in to purchase _num_ rear tires .
so i pulled up my confirmation email on my phone .
so he then asked another associate for help in finding my appointment .
now i also have a constant tire pressure light on thanks to charlotte .
trust me , stay away from the south blvd charlotte location .
you 're killing people 's cars , park road shopping center .
needless to say , i left quite a bit on my plate .
he asked the server twice for it , with no results .
)
, she accommodated my request for the hockey game .
needless to say , we did n't pay and left immediately .
the worst place i 've been too !
burnt so called hash browns , burnt french toast .
i do n't recommend going for breakfast .
probably one of the worst experiences ever .
asked for english muffin advised they only have toast .
my boyfriend ordered liver mush .
a few tables walked out .
i took my daughter here and it was a very bad experience .
this is the worst dry cleaners i 've ever been to .
the second time again _num_ pieces still had small stains on them .
also , their prices are quite expensive .
from the outside , press box looks like a depressing brick house .
it 's definitely cheap .
ugh .
maybe other associates would be better .
the damage to our reputation will take some time to build that trust back .
however , that 's where it ends .
she did say have a nice day as i walked out .
do it yourself for _num_ bucks or spend _num_ here .
this place had _num_ stars out of _num_ reviews .
that set aside , i do n't appreciate him laughing at my response .
this is by far the worst chinese food i have ever had .
there are chinese restaurants on every corner but only few are actually good .
it did n't even look like what i had ordered .
about the dish : it was just flat out nasty .
the breading was soft and mushy .
it was quite bland .
i ordered rice ( no onions with extra egg ) .
it was the most bland fried rice i 've ever tried in my life .
however , i did like the egg roll .
it puts this one to shame .
the latest is my breaking point .
it said limit two so i decided to get another one .
but no .
the rep insisted on pointing it out to me .
the employee there was n't more helpful .
the parking lot is worse .
the produce buyers for the harris teeter brand in general are atrocious .
if you 're a pipe smoker , it 's a necessary evil .
in total , just not worth the drama .
wonder why theres no positive views toward police in the south ?
the _num_ stars is just cause i liked josh .
this place plays more to the over _num_ crowd .
zero stars , this location can only be described as pathetic .
and yes like the other reviews say it is slow .
the service is slow in my opinion for `` fast food '' .
returned again , recieved another one with mustard and pickle .
staff clearly appeared to not care .
the customer service is dreadful beyond belief .
wrong .
absolutely horrible service !
they just obviously could care less on the night shift .
the potatoes were acceptable i.e properly cooked .
they were bland with no spice and no butter served on the side .
the only ice cream that they had was cinnamon flavored - very mediocre .
they were not fresh and were just terrible .
i wo n't be back .
disappointment pretty much sums up my experience at beef & bottle .
in october , i purchased a groupon .
all evening the table shook anytime someone went in or out of the door .
there was also dank mildew odor by our table .
it was not a pleasing atmosphere to have a romantic dinner for _num_ .
but also mentioned it tasted out of a packet , nothing terribly special .
we arrived with a reservation tonight , a tuesday , it was packed !
it was a long stretch of time though between our drinks and our salad .
our server was awful .
she was nice but , sorry , pretty dumb .
i think she was trying to be funny , but it was odd .
so then we ordered our meals .
i could n't believe it .
i also thought i tasted some old bay on my steak .
no thanks , i like just salt and pepper .
i was very unimpressed with the salad too .
iceberg does n't do it for me .
food was average minus , walls were very dirty , service decent .
would not recommend this restaurant to anyone .
i was told this restaurant was like ruth chris , do n't believe it !
service was friendly but lacking .
it was n't terrible , just okay .
dont know how they cook , but had no charcoal flavor or other seasoning .
daughter had rib-eye , which was better , wife had filet i think .
one of our favorites just became not one of our favorites .
it was n't romantic ... just irritating .
just eh .
the side dishes were nothing special .
mashed potatoes were bland , asparagus looked wilted .
i told the server that it was extremely rude to expect us to move .
so , will i go to this restaurant again ?
probably not .
both were cooked well , but there was nothing special about the flavor .
she deserves to be in a better venue .
prices are too high for what you get .
the main dinning room was n't even full .
we wo n't even give them a second chance .
o , there is a $ _num_ coupon on their website .
that will cover cheese and bacon on two baked potatoes .
very pricy for a mediocre meal .
service was okay but nothing special .
oysters rockefeller were good but sauted mushrooms were awful .
after a long while we get our meals .
my husband medium rare rib eye was way over cooked .
so basically they gave him a crappy $ _num_ cut of beef .
the service was slow , steaks heavily seasoned , and presentation was poor .
they seem miserable and make the person dining feel awkward .
the food was mediocre .
the first time we did not have a reservation .
i had no complaints that night .
fast forward to tonight .
i sure as heck wo n't be back .
i will not be back .
we really wish we had skipped this one .
the outside is sketchy , we should have known better .
we were seated right away , but service was slow .
it all went down hill after that .
her pasta looked much better than my scallops which were horrendous .
very disappointing .
the creamed spinach was runny .
it was awful !
full of fat and gristle , i was in shock .
the wait staff did n't seem to care at all .
the place from the outside looks like garbage if not a trailer .
then when you get inside of the place it looks very fancy .
my wife had salmon which she said was not fresh .
both not fresh at all and half left .
it 's terrible and expensive to boot .
we came on a week day .
after another ten minutes , we got up and left .
this past weekend i was throw off by being ignored by my waiter .
i complained and the manager was not sympathetic , in the least .
we ordered _num_ apps and an entre .
not to mention the bottle of wine .
so you do n't need plates to share the apps .
i am over ignoring bad service at this place .
there are too many fantastic places to eat in charlotte .
guess i 'm am also over the feeling of eating dinner in a trailer .
too bad .
plus , the staff was very rude about it .
the sides and salads were bland as well .
when we walked inside it was also still very disappointing .
the hostess said that they gave our table away because we were late .
our entres were decent , nothing too exciting but not horrible either .
but there was nothing cheesy about them .
it just tasted like a hash brown patty .
just as others have said , extremely overpriced !
_num_ .
_num_ .
interior and exterior is outdated and dirty .
_num_ .
crackers with canned cheese instead of fresh bread and butter ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
ny steak was very bland .
_num_ .
cheddar potatoes were frozen and not fresh without any cheddar taste .
_num_ .
vegetables for the salad were separate and not properly cut .
( is it common to have chopped celery on a salad ?
_num_ .
wait staff was friendly however inattentive with water .
_num_ .
from the moment we walked in we immediately felt unwelcome because we had children .
from the time we sat down everything seemed to be a problem .
the server constantly repeated that we had children ... .
if we 're a problem that we had children .
our waitress was not attentive at all from the start .
the second time the steak came out gray and cold ... .
a woman approached and poured my fianc and i a glass of water .
i 'm very disappointed with the service here !
not one to write reviews usually but i will never return .
we spent _num_ plus $ and were rushed from beginning to end .
sat down right at _num_ .
my first clue should have been how fast our appetizer and salad came out .
long story short we were finishing up our meal just slightly after _num_ .
three visits in a row my order has been messed up .
it 's always extremely loud inside because it 's a small restaurant .
back patio is a little better than the front .
i would not take a date here expecting a quiet romantic evening .
deserts are all excellent .
have n't had one i did n't like .
kitchen - f - details are posted above .
_num_ visits in a row with something on my order not cooked properly .
not acceptable anywhere .
the food and ambiance we subpar in my opinion .
the restaurant was dated and the food quality was not the best either .
guess what , i wo n't be buying my supplies there !
this used to be my go to place for fish .
not anymore .
also , the selection of fish is n't what it used to be .
i guess the unique fish went away the same time as the knowledgeable staff .
this is a flat out lie .
dead .
nothing in my sample indicated that my fish should be dying .
stay as far away from any business that is owned by this guy .
he now has closed the store and runs an aquarium maintenance scam .
the bakery is ok , but the service is terrible .
never going back .
boy , was i disappointed .
it looked like a child decorated it .
three layers in a _num_ inch cake ?
the people were nice to me , though .
it rubbed off but still very visible !
the pound cake had not taste , either .
really upsetting and embarrassing since it was a gift .
she was the least helpful person i 've ever met in my life .
why could n't you have told this well before all the stress ?
the experience was completely _num_ % ruined by this lady .
my sister met me there at my suggestion , i am so embarrassed .
this bakery has horrible customer service and rude employees .
i was spoke to several rude and unhelpful employees .
no real effort or attempt was made to fix the cake .
they were all dry !
super disappointed .
i read about the bakery and was excited to check it out .
i get the impression they 've lost interest in their business .
my kids and i stopped in after school to try their cupcakes .
unfortunately , they were extremely dry .
we tried _num_ different cupcakes and every one seemed `` old '' .
i do n't know what much to say about this place .
it is tiny but that does n't bother me at all .
you smelled it as soon as you walked in .
i had no choice but to have _num_ beer while waiting for a friend .
and the bartender was not at all friendly .
i had n't been into jeff 's bucket shop in awhile .
no problem with that but the place reeked last weekend .
hopefully they just overlooked it that one night .
this place had a weird smell with equally weird patrons as well .
if only it had actually been his last night .
so the bar is really , really small .
the bad news is if you want to sing .
tip for service after you sing , not tip just to even get service .
fine place to drink or watch , terrible place to sing .
not a terrible experience but the whole pint thing killed it for me .
looks like they have some new employees since the last time we were there .
the dj guy was not very good .
skipping your songs after you have tipped him .
why ca n't the dj just go in order by who signs up ?
beyond disappointed with this so called club .
most unimpressive cashiers ever .
some of the worst customer service in charlotte nc .
she could n't even finish half of it .
do n't bother with this place .
why would they do such a thing ?
let 's just throw privacy out the window .
it takes entirely too long to order and get food quickly .
_num_ minute max to make ?
when i got there i waited another _num_ minutes !
it was very dry with no mayo or sauce in it .
but today was an off day , i did not enjoy my time spent .
ok , i could live with that .
i had the worst experiences lately there .
_num_ .
i should have walked out then .
did the waitress offer me anything for my trouble , nope .
the food is mediocre at best , tasteless & bland even for british food .
the food has always been mediocre .
the service was not even that good .
the service and prices were disappointing !
i choose the rueben sandwich -- sounded like a safe bet .
i will not be going back anytime soon .
no beer specials on saturday night !
the online menu is not current and meat pie is nowhere to be seen .
the new menu has things like egg rolls with spicy sauce .
the new items are mediocre at best .
definitely had bad tummy the rest of the evening .
sadly i find the food here a bit lacking after having been here twice .
the fries were n't as crisp as i would like and under seasoned .
on the plus side drinks are cheap , and the patrons are friendly .
to about _num_ % wet white fish .
anyway , if i go back , i 'm not sure what to order .
not my kind of lunch though .
the goat cheese fritters were very bland .
without good seasoning , they lost their `` wow '' factor .
the kids ' grilled cheese was dry and bland and the fries soft .
was very slow last night .
two wait staff seemed to be covering the whole room .
we waited _num_ minutes before anyone took our food order .
they have _num_ menus : entrees and bar food which includes appetizers .
terrible all around .
app came out another _num_ minutes later and still nothing else .
no refills .
apparently you only get served if you 're best friend 's with the waiter .
will not go back .
the waitress alone was an example on how you do n't treat your patrons .
suddenly when it was tip time she was courteous .
the food was not good either .
my fries tasted like fish .
the wrap was awful .
sure , they have a fish and chips , but where 's the curry ?
where 's the jacket potato ?
burgers are fine , but that 's american food not proper british fare .
do i really have to be a regular to get any friendly service ?
that pretty much set the tone for an unpleasant night for me .
server could not have possibly cared less if we were there , or not .
the fact that this place has his approval is not to be taken lightly .
-- not the way to win customers ' hearts .
hostess was awful , but the waitress was nice !
it 's dead here and the food was awful .
will not be back .
the waitress could not have been any more rude .
i really do n't think i 've ever had such a rude waitress .
then walked away .
i have never had a worse experience at any restaurant in my life .
i highly recommend you avoid the place .
used to be my favorite !
i ordered a hamburger with no mustard , no mayo , and cheddar cheese .
disgusting .
i visited here with my fiance last night after about _num_ years away .
the entrees were better ; enjoyable but nothing to write home about .
but for $ _num_ , the value factor drops it to a poor .
came starving and left hungry ... .
not impressed or coming back .
it just seems odd to me .
i wanted to like it but something was off .
who knows my mom might just be a terrible cook .
the stew like base just had this burnt taste to it .
needless to say we skipped dessert ... .
i could n't dare run the chance of them ruining apple pie for me !
i 'm hoping it was just a bad night in the kitchen .
i ca n't believe they were n't ashamed bringing that out to me .
rudest bartender and staff i have encountered .
menu was n't available online only last year 's .
very overpriced and extremely small portions ... .
the weather is great but the service mediocre at best .
i said they know better and so should you .
did they think i 'd consider paying for a salad i sent back ?
no one cared or came .
my boyfriend and i ate here just an hour ago .
so i tried two more bites which were equally awful .
then made my boyfriend ( nicest guy ever ) try a bite .
why , i do n't know .
wait ... they have food , too ?
not a place i want to spend my evenings in charlotte .
i got food poisoning the last time i ate here as did my girlfriend .
we had the burgers plus the waitress was rude , would not recommend .
the only redeeming quality is , that the owners will someday die .
i wish i could give them zero stars .
_num_ .
this put two holes in my brand new skirt .
_num_ .
they lost my third dress and told me i did n't bring it in .
i have never in my life been so disgusted with a business .
place is dirty .
my clothes had that dry cleaner smell for days longer than other cleaners .
never going back .
it also takes a long time for them to get repairs done .
unfortunately this is my last time going to this location .
management must be poor to continue to allow this all of the time .
too bad .
the predictable result is long waits .
i am very disappointed .
this place has gone downhill .
every time i come here i am disappointed .
the worst service and most unprofessional staff i have ever seen .
Negative
i would 've given negative stars if possible .
i tried the level _num_ bed for _num_ mins .
day _num_ - i walked in and the place was packed .
so would _num_ mins in the _num_ be okay .
then tried to sell me a package .
this is where everything went wrong .
needless to say i wont go back .
i did not buy lotion .
however , that 's where the nice ends .
but i regret ever going in because the staff is so pushy .
and somehow convinced me to do the _num_ dollar membership .
it 's like they argued with me about it .
awkward .
a .
the board of health should close them down .
because mine did seem used .
awful awful awful .
boy , was i in for a disappointment !
i was furious inside and i was shocked she just ignored my comment .
weird and rude .
i do not recommend it and i will never be going back .
plus horrible customer service .
boy was i wrong .
in a rush of course because there are still people waiting .
when i look down , my foot was bleeding !
sub par manicure and pedicure is being nice .
the tips of my nails were n't painted either .
definitely not , the technician was extremely rough to the point of pain .
lame .
boo to this store , epic fail .
terrible service and attention to detail .
not even close .
i will not be paying $ _num_ to get fit on a bike .
this is the second time i have tried to use them .
they told him no problem and it would be around a week or so .
i was the wrong tire .
i explained this bike was my only transportation and i needed it .
he stated _num_ mins and it would cost _num_ .
one sales person made a lame excuse .
no body seem to give a damn about me .
so never trust them and be careful because they love to lie to you .
unfortunately , the new bike was stolen from our garage ten days later .
it was over priced and tasteless .
really , $ _num_ for that ?
the potato salad was pretty awful also .
just not for me i guess .
the service was friendly so i 'll give _num_ stars for that at least .
unfortunately , i do n't agree with their choice .
there was way too much going on on that plate .
let me preface this review by saying ... i rarely give _num_ stars .
it was flat and pretty still sitting on the floor of the car .
i was starving , and ate two of the massive slices .
actually , after that , we threw everything away .
as for the chicken parm , we were underwhelmed .
it was forgettable .
no distinct flavor , just the standard chicken parm .
the salad , was equally as weak .
the dressing one yelper called `` amazing '' -- was a creamy orange nothing .
it added nothing to the salad .
walked away disappointed .
the breading was light and very bland !
no seasoning at all .
and i ate it on my bread so the marinara gets _num_ stars !
it was sour tasting and extremely salty and very tough .
i only ate one piece of pizza .
overall experience is a _num_ i guess .
bad food for the price .
specials suggested by our waiter were really bad .
place and wine was ok .
i 'm disgusted with the food they serve at this place .
i think the restaurant impossible should visit this place and fire the chef .
not exactly wonderful but not bad .
it was n't worth what we paid though .
the server we had was also very rude .
no `` thanks for coming in . ''
headed to try this place for the first time tonight .
but the service was atrocious .
worst i 've experienced in charlotte .
not good .
i come here 's few times a month & normally have the same dish .
the garlic bread was covered in it .
my wife and i frequented this place almost on a weekly basis .
no one even acknowledged our table .
needless to say , we got up and left .
we got pizza here last sunday and it was dry .
first it was they left it in too long because of us .
then it was sitting out too long .
never again will i go back .
no thanks !
service slow .
a sure sign of poor quality food !
no broccoli .
_num_ ) the cappuccino needs to be removed from the restaurant .
i doubt she has ever seen an espresso machine .
horrible service.
the portofino 's at the other location may be better i hope so .
i suggest you try a different restaurant if you want good italian food .
these folks are a complete unprofessional joke .
terrible property manager .
nor does first service return phone messages .
so my wife and i went in to purchase window treatments for our house .
my business will be taken elsewhere .
so , why the _num_ star ?
i was busy , so requested another day .
called them back , only to be told that they only deliver on tuesdays .
the couch should never have made it past quality control at the plant .
these were n't subtle problems .
anyone who looked at the couch could spot the problems .
but they shipped it out anyway .
buying a couch should n't be this difficult .
huge mistake .
not good .
so disappointed .
i really ca n't believe they returned it worse than when i brought it .
they are clueless .
had to go back _num_ times and my shirt was still not right .
worst place in this city to get alterations .
i made the mistake of taking a very expensive jacket here .
worst customer service of my life .
after a few cleanings your clothing will look old and worn .
not a wide selection of belly button rings .
- parking leaves much to be desired .
i had it to go , so it was too late to go back .
i did n't finish anything .
i 'm going to think twice before i go to this store again .
these guys are not easy to deal with .
worse service in town .
it was n't bad food , just way over priced for low end average .
nothing special here .
after waiting almost two hours beyond our scheduled time , they sat us .
this was my first time here and likely my last .
service was poor .
waiter was missing for _num_ minutes .
from that point on things just got worse .
would not go there again even if meal was for nothing .
we 've been _num_ times and it never gets better .
bar menu was good , appetizers we only okay .
food is mediocre & drinks are n't strong .
it 's the place you regret going to because you 're completely isolated .
terrible .
there is not one good thing to say about this place .
all _num_ of our meals were overlooked .
my chicken colorado was burned to a brick .
all of the orders were burned and cold .
they obviously do n't care .
do not waste money here .
we finally walked out .
huge disappointment .
if that is what you are looking for this is not your spot .
this was a bit shocking to me , especially considering the monthly price tag .
: z , but no one seemed bothered by it .
it is not yoga by definition .
the ( raw fish ) sushi was warmer than room temperature .
my dining companion eats here regularly ( why ? )
i value my health too much to try it again .
my husband and i went to sushi _num_ on a tuesday evening .
we met up with a group of people of approximately _num_ people .
the sushi , well , was a huge disappointment .
the rolls have became really small and prices are not in line either .
i was unimpressed by the taste of the rolls , finding them rather bland .
i doubt i would go back .
the sushi was in general mediocre .
the service on the other hand was sub-par .
the food was barely at par , nothing special .
but at $ _num_ for what you get it 's a bit expensive .
terrible service for overpriced moderate quality sushi in a roach infested strip mall .
no matter where i visit , i must have sushi .
in all honesty , not real memorable .
i 've got nothing .
the rainbow roll was also your stock rainbow roll , nothing special .
walked in on a decently busy friday night , to an empty hostess stand .
again , awkward , but we shrugged it off .
by this point we were more than ready to leave and not come back .
sushi _num_ , go back to school .
the rice on all the sushi was mushy .
absolutely horrible .
i just tossed my entire order in the trash .
we were starving so anything good would have tasted great .
rubbery chicken , and the teriyaki sauce was just disgusting .
this meal was literally sooo gross .
another thing was the rice , simply disgusting .
if you 're looking for good hibachi do not go here !
they do n't even have white sauce ... like japanese say what .
since when did imitation crab become passable as chefs choice sashimi .
i always loved this place ... but damn .
so , the only spot i could remember was sushi _num_ .
and , boy , biggest regret .
the service was horrible , very rude and short server .
as for the tuna , what a horrible piece of tuna .
i was n't even able to chew it .
i will not return and know there are better sushi spots in charlotte now .
do n't waste your time and money !
the lady that served me was great and quickly submitted my order .
the worst delivery service ever !
it was _num_ hour and _num_ mins before our order was delivered !
no worries .
jason 's deli offers small portions of below average food .
it 's not !
take a look at the better business bureau and ripoff report .
too long of a story , but trust me .
they do not care about you .
i properly cancelled my services and still get charge from time to time .
do not go with this company .
lots of people working but slow and no help .
the staff always seems to be in a bad mood .
the line was only about _num_ people deep and took well over _num_ minutes .
i 'll buy online instead .
burgers were n't bad .
the fat cow behind the drive thru window had such a nasty attitude .
i miss the ciabatta bun burger that had that awesome sauce .
the customer service at this location is pretty bad .
i get that nobody wants to work on christmas day .
maybe he should find one of those instead .
at this economy i really wish that people were appreciative to have a job .
these employees really need training or to be replaced with friendlier individuals .
i used to come to this location every night after work .
so , a few days ago , i decided to redeem my coupons .
in the past , this has been a very senses oriented experience .
not this gal .
i never felt so ugly .
i thought that maybe i should shave my head and start over .
i walked in because i was curious about the curly line .
a woman greeted me and asked me what i was looking for .
i took the action to be extremely rude and i left .
went to red rocks cafe on christmas eve .
the dish was lackluster at best .
the angel hair pasta was mushy and the sauce needed flavor .
i 'm not sure whether id go back again .
it was n't terrible but it was n't wonderful .
i have been here several times in the past and have left pleased .
last saturday night , though - maybe an off night ?
arrived at 6:30 and told there would be a _num_ minute wait .
finally seated _num_ minutes later .
no offer for a free appetizer or anything .
service was ok , not stellar .
this place was just ok .
the server we had was horrible .
no personality whatsoever .
if you decide to go do n't let her help you .
i had salad and a fillet w/ mashed potatoes .
then my sides got cold .
but this service makes me never want to go there again .
this was by far the worse .
i was really disappointed in red rocks .
i have been going to red rocks for _num_ years .
i went on saturday night and this will be the last time .
my daughter ( _num_ yrs old ) ordered spinach ravioli with chicken .
what she got was a soup with some ravioli in it .
he apologized and went to the kitchen to get the chicken .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
this was _num_ minute after he said they did .
there were _num_ of us at the table , we all heard it .
strike _num_ .
ten years later we went tonight for a group event .
the she crab soup tasted old and salty .
at $ _num_ , not a good investment .
bland !
my sides - garlic mashed potatoes and green beans - were equally bland .
at least our steaks were cooked correctly .
the vanilla bean torte for dessert was the only decent thing we ate .
i do n't know where to start with how horrible this experience was .
the food had no flavor , just plain .
the chocolate cake was the lone highlight of the meal .
just ordered take out .
$ _num_ for approximately _num_ chips .
service is slow !
the problem that night was the rude hostess .
there are too many better restaurants in the area to ever go back .
a most unfortunate evening and a loss of _num_ customers .
no breakfast sausage , grits or quiche .
wo n't be returning for mother 's day next year .
it is a pretty pricy thai restaurant .
we got the take out pad see ew tonight .
this was a very loose and spicy clear sauce .
the spring rolls were plain but fine .
it wasnt bad at all , but nothing special at all .
i continue trying to like this place but am disappointed almost every time .
$ _num_ for mediocre shrimp curry is n't worth it !
i could n't believe how spicy it was !
considering our previous experience this lunch was as unexpected as it was disappointing .
since we did n't want beef stir fry the choices were chicken or chicken .
the soup was clear broth of chicken with rice .
it was n't even remotely hot and besides there was little there , there .
again no heat at all .
this place is not for you .
i am only giving _num_ stars because i feel bad giving one star .
i wo n't be back .
the pan friend noodle was plain taste and nothing special .
the noodle soup was bland taste .
the vegetable they used in the noodles were cheap .
bunch of cheap onions and baby corn .
restaurant owner yelled `` we close at _num_ '' .
my less than warm welcome left a bad taste .
there was nothing overly special about the pad thai or yellow curry .
you really do n't get the full effect of the thai dishes .
if it you want better portions & consistency , this is not the place .
the service is lacking n here 's why !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
overpriced tasteless fake thai food .
service was n't great either .
shrimp dishes were overcooked and chewy .
pan fried noodles were rubbery southern style thick wide pastry strips .
not enough properly cooked vegetables in soup and/or entrees .
holly really had an attitude and was n't very pleasant to talk to either .
this place is terrible !
if you are looking to sell , go elsewhere !
the jeweler off park road offered over $ _num_ !
i would n't trust them to buy any jewelry at any reasonable price .
i did not pay until going through each piece .
very disappointed and very unsatisfied from just _num_ quick visits .
i will not go back again due to customer service and pricing alone .
do n't waste your money here .
elizabeth screwed up my cut and color .
very unprofessional yet expensive salon !
the atmosphere was calming and the staff greeting us was friendly enough .
for starters , my chair did n't work at all !
my last purchase at belk was an expensive bra .
i felt ill so left after that purchase .
not even the courtesy of a reply .
i have visited this belk on several occasions .
this weekend i had a rather odd experience .
the white customer being waited on had a lengthy transaction .
the white customer did not have to ask .
i would suggest you pass on this one .
one time i got a voicemail box but of course no calls back .
the salespeople have probably all tuned it out so they just never answer .
what 's the worst that can happen ?
no big deal .
this was purchased at a showroom in los angeles .
he did n't even give me a chance to explain how i needed help .
he was rude from the first moment he picked up the phone .
that was not good customer service !
i felt very uncomfortable and rushed the entire time .
in one small , closing statement `` this mall has been around since _num_ .
no thanks .
there is no way i would have made it in on my own .
he also left an oil stain on my driver 's side mat .
i pulled up in a lane with only one car ahead of me .
pretty much would only recommend this place to my worst enemy .
not a real chick-fil-a .
it took _num_ minutes from when they took her order !
and it was wrong !
( no nuts , and _num_ in an _num_ piece box ) .
i would not recommend this shop .
they looked at my car three times and the problem was not fixed .
they are cheap !
worst experience of my life ... living with roaches !
they are not professional !
i wish i can give them no star .
the new company that has recently taken over are absolute hell .
worst customer service ever .
their customer service is the worst .
stay away stay away from this place .
this is literally the most poorly run starbucks i 've ever been to .
the nice girl at the counter took my name .
most lazy starbucks employee i 've ever encountered .
this is the most terrible place to get coffee .
finally one young man realized something was wrong with the coffee .
do n't get alterations done once you purchase the suit !
just an overall unreal experience , from start to finish .
the incompetence and lack of professionalism was astounding !
but believe me , they are .
secondly , the girls almost never acknowledge you when you walk in .
however , would it kill them to actually do their damn jobs ?
save yourself the trouble ... do n't shop here !
then she tried to get me to buy it at full price .
this woman should not have a job working with people .
so yes , i said , i 'm going to buy the damn string .
i take my purchase up to the register and greet the cashier .
what the hell ?
the guy who answer the call was n't helpful or nice .
my first fresh market was in south carolina , and it was an oasis .
so does harris teeter .
the staff , mainly the younger staff , are not very friendly or helpful .
please bring back curry chicken salad .
the deli ca n't tell me why you do n't carry it .
buyer beware , worst return policy ever .
terrible customer service !
terrible customer service !
regular avoid this location , you will be disappointed .
it 's expensive , for one .
not having as many locations means more crowded stores and more videos picked over .
by far the worst professional setting ever .
once they noticed it was good coverage they called me in .
i felt totally uncomfortable with the whole situation here .
Negative
if i could give them a negative review i would .
i wish no stars was an option .
what a terrible experience i have had here .
gross !
gross !
gross !
and my order is wrong !
and horrible parking lot to enter and leave !
now they have lost my business completely .
i walk in the following saturday and they had no record of the incident .
i would not eat here again .
she said , `` i am sorry i will get you another one . ''
figured maybe it was a fluke and went again several weeks later .
wish i could give this less than one star .
awful service , workers are rude and careless .
the past three times i 've been i was very disappointed .
no straw or napkins were ever put in the bag .
disappointed that bojangles has gone so downhill .
but it 's a food court , so choices are limited .
the pricing was a bit confusing and i 'm still convinced we were overcharged .
not that i had high expectations for mall food .
my husband was n't very happy with his pizza .
basically ... it 's mall food court pizza .
oddly the cashier over complicated it and made it difficult to split the bill .
this was my second visit .
but the food just is n't memorable for me .
i ate there a few weeks ago and it was n't good .
i wo n't be back .
and , unfortunately , there were no descriptions .
unfortunately , it was n't .
and there was nothing on the table to doctor it up .
atmosphere is a big deal for me .
tres tacky .
the friendly woman at the register said that the prices had gone up .
my last visit - lunchtime - really disappointed me .
avoid at all costs !
wish i could give it less than _num_ star .
the waiter was very unhelpful .
horrible service .
upholstery was outdated .
the customer service was n't very great to begin with .
the lady was n't very friendly and helpful in suggesting any special dish .
pork fried rice - it was blah !
there was no flavor to the rice but oil .
general tso chicken - it was blah too !
unfortunately i was highly disappointed .
best chinese , no .
very old and stale feeling .
the servers were nice , but the food was less than great .
nothing to write home about and too many other chinese restaurants that are better .
this place is n't what it use to be .
( support staff was great , but waiter was horrible ) .
rudest , most disrespectful server i 've ever had .
he was so unpleasant ( borderline angry ) and he ruined our dining experience .
he should not be working with the public .
i 'm sorry to say we will not be back .
food does n't match the restaurant 's look and atmosphere .
disappointing .
would n't recommend it if you 're looking for good chinese .
ordered delivery and it was not good .
chicken noodle soup tasted like water .
the customer service in this place is horrible .
the people look miserable in there , and the food is mediocre .
the brown rice must have been sitting back there as it was dried out .
no more profit from us .
ordered takeout , no big deal .
mediocre sorta chinese food is n't worth $ _num_ and terrible customer service .
this may be the worst chinese meal i 've ever had .
it makes me sad to post this review .
this place was once the go-to old school chinese place .
food was terrible .
today the garlic sauce scallops were fishy tasting and tough .
i used to really like it , but the food quality has gone downhill .
the last few times i ordered from here , the food was atrocious .
menu items do n't taste fresh and the dishes are not up to par .
the fried rice hardly tastes fried .
it is like white rice with veggies mixed in .
the pan fried dumplings are limp , like pulled from a freezer and microwaved .
the lo mein tastes like old noodles soaked in soy sauce .
so , i decided to check them out again .
however , the soup , blah again .
i ordered the chicken and shrimp with mixed veggies for my entre .
i am not a big fan of this restaurant .
i just think the tastes were a little bit off .
if i want some shoes , i 'm going straight here .
immediately , i 'm turned off .
i will not be returning .
i have received the worst customer service in this nordstrom 's cosmetic department .
i was visiting charlotte and decided to check out nordstrom for a hair product .
secondly , she was unreasonable rude .
this nordstrom has the worst customer service ever !
i will give them another chance because of the great service they usually provide .
i will give them another chance because of the great service they usually provide .
the store manager at this location is very rude .
poor customer service .
unfortunately i had the worst possible customer service at this location .
it might be a bit expensive for you though .
it 's like $ _num_ .
i ca n't even make this shit up .
and sesame chicken was basically in a syrup , not a sauce .
got charged for water .
worst $ _num_ ( after tax and water ) buffet ever .
will not order from this place again .
after my attempts to flag someone down failed , i decided to leave .
i can not comment on their work as it did not get that .
one of my options was to pay the shortage and increase my monthly payment .
on the february statement , everything was screwed up !
their complaint was that my mortgage payment was too low .
all _num_ times i was given the excuse that a supervisor was not available .
i am completely frustrated with this company !
since then , they have incorrectly processed each of my additional mortgage payments .
not a good breakfast choice .
today something is off at phil 's deli .
i gave her the sour cream back and said i needed alot of butter .
but this is butter for crying out loud .
that 's like charging for ketchup packs .
the gnocchi we started with was very heavy and over cooked .
the wine by the glass menu was very limited .
my dish had butternut squash in it , but you could n't taste anything .
no shrimp , no squash .
now why a rating of _num_ ?
we were not impressed at all with the food .
the pasta my wife ordered was supposed to have rib-eye beef tips .
the complimentary bean dip was ok .
this was a constant complaint from my wife throughout our dinner .
the wait staff was not great either .
poor service .
no butter for the bread though ... not sure what happened there .
when our entrees arrived , neither of us were pleased .
rather bland .
the mozzarella cheese was flavorless .
i would not recommend this place .
poor food quality .
poor wait staff .
avoid this place .
it 's very pricey for very little portions .
she was as attentive as she could be .
we really were quite disappointed with the food .
we were very disappointed in this restaurant .
to start , the waiter talked to us a total of _num_ times .
it tasted more like burnt brown sauce than marsala .
ick !
went with our dinner group and we were all fairly disappointed .
our hostess was terribly rude and confused .
no explanation .
one really ca n't complain .
he kept our waters full .
yelp reviewers really threw me off on this one .
watered down carbonara that was dripping ( which it never should ) .
rubbery lobster that you literally could not cut - let alone chew .
for frozen crap ?
are you kidding me ?
anyway , took the table ; service was extremely slow .
we ordered and the food came out approximately _num_ minutes later .
but we 're not those people .
however , the risotto that was on the menu was not what was served .
at this point , the busboy comes over to clear our dishes .
we said no , thank you .
very disappointing experience .
based off of the menu i ordered the veal ravioli in butter sage sauce .
my fiance did n't care for her dish either .
i could go on but i have better ways to spend my time .
the waiter which i think was the manager was rude , arrogant and unapologetic .
no big deal .
but _num_ of us ate and the 4th waited .
overpriced mediocre food served by people who need a lesson in customer service .
well , i was wrong .
i did n't feel that the prices here were all that great .
)
early sunday morning visit to pick up something for breakfast .
thumbs down on this place .
it was a horrible experience i hate that place .
later i received a bill for $ _num_ .
after _num_ year i was told that insurance gave them the wrong information .
i think this is wrong .
recommendation , make sure you get things in writing from them .
of course , the appointment was smooth for me to be seen .
i consider the wait for the doctor to be normal .
the eye exam was redone by the doctor - that was professional .
i do not recommend .
this simple eye exam ended up taking _num_ and a half hours .
it was all mush and no banana .
if i could it rate this dairy queen with _num_ stars i would !
needless to say there was nothing queen like about this experience .
it tasted nothing like what i was used to having at dairy queen .
i just kept saying literally '' this is not dairy queen hot fudge . ''
it was very thick and barely had any flavor to it .
it tasted like cheap hot fudge .
like i said before , i will not be returning this particular location again .
so my fianc drove to the south blvd location .
the decor was awful !
i tried the fried oyster salad and there was two crab cakes ordered .
we also had no plates to eat with as all had been cleared .
we were actually all laughing at this point because it was just a disaster .
i could not wait to leave .
terrible .
i left and will not go back .
how has it become so acceptable for doctors to just waste patients ' time ?
not only was the wait terrible , the desk staff were rude .
i wasted _num_ hours of my work day .
never received follow up call or appt .
not a well run business in my opinion .
office staff are completely incompetent .
no call .
also , come an hour late for your appointment .
the worst .
why am i being charged _num_ facility fees ?
its so sick .
and its so wrong .
that type of doctor and medical care is a lost art .
i wait _num_ weeks for my recent appointment .
she never diagnosed a problem .
avoid at all costs .
i have never heard that in my life !
the second thing , i never got my temporary card .
i did not originally purchase the shirt on sale or clearance .
it would n't open at all .
i had n't been in since they moved across the parking lot .
i went in to browse yesterday ( saturday ) and was really disappointed .
they did n't greet me or my sister .
i love mac makeup , and i 'm a total makeup junkie .
love mac 's products , but the service lost a sale .
maybe it 'd be a better place to visit for dinner .
the mgr complained that _num_ ppl had not shown up .
they probably saw the same sign & left .
why not just honor the $ _num_ & not lose business ?
we spent over $ _num_ due to a fixed price menu & were unhappy .
stupid .
i 'll go back just to use the groupon but never again .
she did n't even apologize .
every dish seems to have something in it to kill the patron .
the french do not eat this crap .
if the flounder is good , why ruin it ?
needless to say , we paid and left .
i 'm very disappointed with this selection .
wine comes , brought by waiter _num_ who is also the bartender .
crap on your groupon customers .
Positive
however , the experience overall has been negative .
because it `` can not be combined with any other offers . ''
that was _num_ months ago .
still no response .
the manager ( ? )
very over rated restaurant .
the waiter was a heavy smoker and smelt bad .
the prices were very steep and the food was so so .
my friend , a vegetarian , could not find anything on the menu .
waste of money .
customer service was lacking due to rude staff .
do n't know if i would even try to go again .
thanks for nothing .
spent _num_ hours at home being sick .
we felt rushed towards the end .
not impressed - for the price the food is average .
the ambiance is okay , not exceptional either .
meal for two was $ _num_ with no wine or drinks .
there are better restaurants in the area .
unfortunately this happened after i had taken a bite of my salad .
then this same situation happened to the table sitting next to us .
the food was average and nothing special .
i would never ever go back and feel that i was robbed .
very boring , nothing interesting .
i cant find anything that stands out from a positive aspect .
the service was disappointing at best .
the staff was so overwhelmed we were barely spoken to .
i do not dine out to be ignored or spoken down to .
this time , the service and attention to details were terrible .
our waitress was nice but totally inexperienced for this type of restaurant .
she was more en par with a typical chain restaurant at best .
first thing first ... service was awful .
the place was dead .
that should have been our first warning sign .
simple things like , `` what fruit comes with the french toast ? ''
while we waited , our water and coffee glasses sat empty .
when the food came , it all got worse .
my boyfriend 's $ _num_ truffle burger was a disgrace .
flavorless and over cooked .
if you ca n't do brunch well , just stay closed .
it 's a shame you ruined our decent dinner experience .
no explanation .
one man walked all the way through the room confused on where to go .
lamb was cold .
probably will not return .
the crap did n't do a thing during the procedure it hurts like hell .
never seen anything like it .
i got no answers to my concerns .
after about a week , the nurse called me with the lab results .
she said that she did n't know , that she would ask .
got there i 'm sorry but your appointment has been cancelled .
excuse me , what do you mean my appointment has been cancelled ?
very bad day .
but i would avoid this practice at al costs .
seems unethical and completely wrong to me !
very unhappy !
unfortunately , the outside mirrors what 's going on the inside .
even the surly teenage kids checking you out , i can deal with .
but i was n't very excited about buying much .
the parking lot is indeed dangerous with holes , the other reviews are correct .
forgetting a condiment or a special request , okay , but the patty ?
worst wendy 's i been to .
was n't to impressed .
i wo n't be back .
Negative
the place is consistently slow .
just a mistake that could of happened anywhere .
i ordered _num_ jr hamburgers plain but one with lettuce and tomato .
opened it up and they all _num_ had cheese !
they gave me a stone hard `` grilled '' asiago burger .
one of the staff was rude beyond words .
they are very rude , unsanitary , and slow .
by far the worst customer service i 've ever experienced .
it was absolutely ridiculous .
he then responded he would n't continue until i pay .
as if i was some fool who did n't understand how it was done .
needless to say , this place sucks .
not to mention she did n't paint my whole nail .
needless to say i wo n't be going back .
i 've tried different workers and they all are equally horrible .
i have officially washed my hands of them .
worse nail experience ever !
my toes have nail polish all over my skin .
very disappointed tonight .
poor service .
today apparently everyone had a order in a they actually ran out of numbers .
literally , yelled .
`` nothing , '' i replied .
i immediately drove down university city blvd .
i wish i could give this place _num_ stars .
and she just kept yelling until i walked out .
uh , no thanks !
nice room , but this place needs to step up their breakfast .
however this location is n't too good .
first , the road leading to it is horrible .
it does n't help that the signage is poor as well .
the room itself was clean , and had the usual assortment of items here .
however the bed was very uncomfortable and i could not sleep at all .
finally , the breakfast was just not very good .
the place is entirely too small .
the place does not look well kept .
maybe she was having a bad day but that was unacceptable .
the orders were put in wrong .
i ordered filet mignon and chicken combo .
overall though i was so let down and would not return .
had the worst service ever there .
i really do n't think the waitress spoke english .
then another _num_ minutes to get our bill back .
when we complained to the hostess , she said oh , ok .
i waited almost _num_ mins before my food was ready for take out .
i was craving some hibachi grilled food and this place jumped out at me .
and presentation was awful as well , but the service was ok .
like it made no sense !
really ?
i tried the sliders and i 'm over it now .
the b & m of this store is fine .
usually easy and smooth to buy , rent , or sell books .
meh is the only way to describe my experience here yesterday .
just a blank unfriendly stare .
very , very , dry falafel .
too bad , i was looking for a good , new , dining experience .
the gyro meat was greasy and dried out at the same time .
there was barely any actual green coloring to it .
later that night , i got really sick .
it was food poisoning , no doubt .
nope i do n't want to play guessing games with a menu .
i should have waited the _num_ hours .
but the size and limited toppings made it not worth the price .
i ordered the cheeseburger pizza .
so they earned the _num_ stars fair and square .
i will not be shopping there again .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
racist !
walked in and the guy was throwing racist comment at me .
does n't have a return policy .
i bought a hookah and it sucked .
do n't waste your time with this place they have low quality items .
been here _num_ times wanting to try their food .
today , sunday , they should be open _num_ to _num_ .
would i return maybe as a last resort .
and miso soup was incredibly watered down .
could find better japanese in the area .
i probably should have kept driving .
stale chips .
if it were n't for that i would never go back .
i get waited on almost immediately and i place my order at fair prices .
i 'm about five minutes from the office so i decide to eat in .
odd ... but did n't pay much attention .
_num_ % of the food is going to the drive through window .
more like a stop and wait and wait and wait .
_num_ min wait to be precise !
all that wait and the food sucks and was cold .
so , i stopped by here since it was so close .
big mistake .
someone finally walked to the register to take my order .
it was just meh .
the chips and salsa that came with it were meh .
meh , meh , meh .
if you 're in a rush , do n't stop by here .
gross !
the bun looked half cooked and the burger was cooked past dead .
with all the toppings thrown on and a cup of mayonnaise .
if you can avoid this restaurant please avoid this restaurant .
if i could give it less than one star i would .
this is not the only unsanitary thing i 've seen here .
she completely ignored me .
the people by the door were already waited on .
i am a white man , _num_ years old , and disabled .
i turned and walked out without getting my dinner .
i will simply never patronize your establishment again .
i was given a pizza with stale cheese and sauce .
sometimes fresh , sometimes stale .
little caesar 's : eat stale .
and he was yelling at me too .
you should check your reviews on google .
and i 'm sorry but you did n't pack the box .
the caesar salad was pretty average , too .
it 's hard to make a caesar salad bad , though .
but that 's not enough to bring me back for lunch .
do we need _num_ hostesses for a saturday night ?
i 'm not sure what they were doing there .
much less charge them extra .
i would honestly usually give _num_ star for how bad this experience was .
i wish i could say it was just the staff that was rude .
steak was undercooked and so was chicken .
mashed potatoes were crusty ?
and then to top it off we had trouble with the bill .
she never came back and she was n't busy .
maybe _num_ people at the bar and one other table .
she is the only reason this place gets _num_ stars .
completely over fried , hard , and dry .
atmosphere was lame and so were the servers .
plain jane central .
it 's because it was n't prepared fresh .
they were sour and had too much breading that was n't freshly prepared .
and the nachos were a disgrace .
very sparse to say the least .
such a disappointment .
sub-par food and sub-par service is the only way i can describe this place .
the service is extremely slow ... ... if you receive service at all .
service was so poor that we never went back .
then nothing , absolutely nothing .
no one took my order for either drinks or food .
this did not make me happy .
it was not clear to me that day .
terrible service .
terrible food .
terrible drinks .
this was unbelievable .
he did n't bother sending back .
very bad experience !
after another _num_ minutes or so the server brings the check .
my wife and i stopped in on sunday afternoon for lunch .
we had a very poor server .
we will not be back .
there are plenty of other places who would like our money .
the waiter we had had been working there for _num_ days .
there were other wait staff did n't even attempt to help him .
we waited _num_ minutes before someone came over .
the manager walked by did n't even stop .
when our order was taken he could n't get that right .
service was fine , food was not .
diced chicken , bacon , eggs , pico and jalapenos .
my wife and _num_ kids walked in this afternoon .
hostess barely even spoke to us .
after _num_ minutes of waiting for someone to come by we left .
this has been typical lately at this location .
the bean were mush .
i 've had canned beans with more texture and better flavor .
i also could n't tell if it had been fried or not .
the taco looked like it needed a lot of love .
the meat was oddly seasoned and had gross , mushy texture to it .
ick .
overall , if i do go back i 'm trying something else .
we asked for a new basket and they were a tiny bit better .
we asked for mild salsa and it came out like tomato juice .
we know we can get better chips elsewhere .
( mixed fajitas with chicken , beef , shrimp , carnitas and chorizo ) .
it was my favorite thing and i honestly could n't stop eating it .
we both got sick to our stomachs and could not finish our meal .
maybe just a bad experience , but we wo n't be back .
this place has really gone down hill as of late .
tonight 's visit was a nightmare .
typical last minute decision , tired kids , grumpy spouse .
the chips were stale and over cooked , or double cooked .
it was just bad .
they are a new item , beef tips in a burrito .
not awful really .
they were not good .
the service was pretty lame too .
it 's not as bad as it used to be , its worse !
it was not pretty , but tasted ok .
if only there were biscuits to go with the chile relleno .
what used to be my favorite mexican restaurant has now become my least .
it used to be good , but recently has gone downhill .
this place is a very mediocre mexican restaurant .
the service is horrible .
not to mention the food .
you 're much better off going across the street to don pedro .
the chile relleno has no pepper .
grilled chicken - dry and flavorless .
tortillas used for enchiladas thick and rubbery .
quesadilla - a running cheesy mess .
horrible service !
service was extremely disappointing .
as for the food , it felt like it was missing something .
the cheese dip was decent but it was too runny .
the chicken in my burrito was n't seasoned very much .
the steak i 'm her fajita was also kind of bland .
it was n't bad , it just needed some spices .
this was the worst restaurant experience i have ever had !
customer service was so bad .
she clearly did n't know what she was talking about .
the service was quick , but not friendly .
i had the tuna melt and was a bit disappointed .
this place is a hot mess !
did n't eat , wo n't come again .
someone recommended this place , they said the subs were good .
i do n't really disagree , i do n't agree either .
the subs are n't bad , better than subway , i suppose .
so it 's not saying much .
decor is incredibly outdated , no wifi .
why am i providing _num_ star ?
the meatball sub tasted as if it came out a can .
also , this place is so over priced .
major fail !
will not go back .
not greeted when i walked in , stared down actually .
ordered just a philly chicken cheese steak .
chicken had some weird spices in it .
almost seemed like they have the same chicken for the philly and fajita sandwich .
almost $ _num_ for the sandwich alone with tax .
online check-in takes priority over walk-ins .
avoid this place .
dim sum is not good at all .
this restaurant is better than dim sum on central .
that is not really saying much .
the dishes seem frozen and not fresh .
the dim sum was bland and not much variety .
i do not expect charlotte to have the quality dim sum of large cities .
however , they are not .
sad sad sad .
seriously , dragon court , wtf ?
there is zero excuse for this crap .
textures : the textures of several of the dishes were just all wrong .
_num_ minutes to make more dim sum ?
come on , dragon court , i know you 're better than that .
consider this review the first two strikes though .
nasty !
total bill was just under $ _num_ , w/ minimal tip .
( do n't even get me started on the dim sum fillings ! )
i 'd never recommend this place for dim sum to anyone !
what a horrible experience .
hong kong style should be a balanced combination of ground pork and shrimp .
but the most recent time i went , the service was abysmal .
it was truly a disappointment .
i would check their restaurant health scores before you decide to eat here .
we visited yesterday and were extremely disappointed .
i also had an msg headache with _num_ min .
charlotte does not have decent chinese restaurant or dim sum restaurant .
tried this restaurant and it is one of the worst experience .
every food we receive from the cart is either barely warm or cold .
the person that took my order was obviously very sick !
i said `` oh ... okay '' then he walked away .
i finished this review at a different mcdonald 's .
whatever the case , i will not be back .
i 'm not to sure , about this one .
i wo n't make that mistake again , especially not from this location .
its home depot , you 've been there .
i said , it says i need assistance .
she came over and looked at my order and went back to her screen .
she did n't even say she was sorry .
they are n't very helpful here .
nobody in sight to help me load up a shopping cart .
i was looking , i do n't mind doing one or two .
horrible customer service !
attempted to get key made .
through the years , i developed no expectations for them .
i will never visit this university location again .
went back the second time to get it done .
i recently had a vehicle in their shop for a water pump replacement .
i recently had a vehicle in their shop for a water pump replacement .
the worst bowling alley i 've seen in a long time !
i went on a tuesday night for their $ _num_ bowling night .
i think i 'll stick to _num_ park lanes .
_num_ stars ?
asked for sugar free syrup for pancakes , no dice .
pancakes were dry .
i did n't like the atmosphere .
this place was very , very , disappointing .
i was told i should have told my waitress to add more egg .
do n't waste your time or money at this hole in the wall .
i went to the old hickory house on a saturday afternoon for lunch .
i left very disappointed .
the restaurant was not very busy .
overall the place looked like it could use a good scrub down .
the waitress let me know i could sit anywhere .
for the sides i choose baked beans and hushpuppies .
it was tender and that was the only good thing about it .
it was lukewarm and very bland tasting .
there was no smoke flavor at all .
i tried adding some of the bbq sauce .
the sauce was thin with chunks of onions i think in it .
it did not compliment the meat at all .
like the meat they were very bland .
the only redeeming thing about the meal were the hushpuppies .
the other piece was not toasted at all .
the just is no quality control in the kitchen .
less than _num_ minutes later , my food came out .
there was no smoke flavor to it whatsoever .
the taste was okay -- not really overwhelming or remarkable .
the sauce did n't really do much for me .
everyone had mentioned the `` sketchy '' location .
it did n't seem that bad to me .
each pork plate came with _num_ slices of texas toast .
our bill totaled $ _num_ before a tip .
the food was ready very quickly .
it tasted ok , but it was barely warmer than room temperature .
it looked more like a vegetable soup than bbq sauce .
next time , i 'll try somewhere else .
the positives : the hush puppies were amazing .
where i 'll never eat bbq again and it 's not the bbq .
if we caught it he would always apologize and we would pay and leave .
nothing was said by register guy just an apology .
she said no problem and she would get me another bowl .
so , i got up and left never to return again .
i 'm just going to leave it up to you .
i guess the worst part of the meal was the fries and hushpuppies .
the atmosphere was like i was eating from the movie fried green tomatoes .
i was thoroughly disappointed .
but i can not stress enough how bad it really is .
i arrived at about 6:00 pm and there were just three tables occupied .
when i left _num_ minutes later , still just three tables occupied .
and they were out of several of their usual selections to make it worse .
i just did n't think it was good at all .
when you walk in , you see a big smoker behind a counter .
there was no aroma of smoke or bbq at all in the place .
i had a combo plate with chicken , ribs , and brisket .
all were clearly not fresh or even recently made .
all the meats were very dry , tough , and served cold .
they were awful .
sides were limited and were not good at all either .
too many other options for q that are far better to justify returning .
i was expecting authentic eastern nc barbeque .
the brisket was a bit tough .
tried all _num_ meats .
especially the bathroom - wash your hands before you go .
i would look for a better bbq , charlotte .
low and slow is the way to go boys .
barbecue is only as good as the cuts of meat start with .
their cuts seem to be on the cheap and tough side .
even ribs that should 've fallen off the bone were tough and harsh .
barbecue sauce way too heavy and vinegar and not enough heat .
presentation is a big cafeteria zero .
hush puppies were the only thing that lived up to advertising .
ate their brisket last night .
it was n't good at all .
restaurant was pretty dead .
the baked beans also were nice , with some pieces of meat in it .
it also had not a single hint of smoke flavor to it .
the decor is like stepping into a diner from the late _num_ 's .
i went for the first time today and was extremely disappointed .
the flavor was ok , but nothing to write home about .
they were n't cold , but they were n't piping hot , either .
lunch also came with two sad , mushy pieces of texas toast .
at _num_ i called and was told to give them _num_ minutes .
no way !
i was kind enough to not review before but goodness !
the review described my trouble finding it and the lady .
i would definitely not take my pet there !
ugh , this store is ghetto !
the store lighting is horrible & dim .
too bad their store environment is so nasty .
the times i 've eaten here , the food was so-so .
i just do not get it.
i guess bad management .
i 'm a fan of boston market but today was not the business .
instead of garlic spinach i ordered the creamed and it was gross .
the cornbread was like a little crispy brick and basically inedible .
either way this meal was a waste of money .
they will never see another dollar of my money .
the cashiers up front and the management sucks .
this rating is for the stylist in the back not the actual store .
they are not professional .
i was quoted a price of _num_ .
i had to pay _num_ at another salon to fix my hair .
an apology does not fix my hair .
i havent been to a beauty supply store this insulting in my life .
i was highly offended and uncomfortable .
i bought hair and it was $ _num_ on the price sticker .
when i got home i noticed the sticker had been placed over another .
gave only one key , when there were _num_ of us .
Positive
the customer service stinks and the delivery people always take their time .
just like the whole restaurant .
i should not have to do that , just to order some pizza .
i absolutely hate this pizza hut .
they should close down , hire new workers or something .
the absolute worst pizza i have ever had .
there was no cheese on the pizza and the bread was tough .
the cheese bread was tough and did n't have cheese on it either .
the pizza sauce was dried out and was too much .
there was barely any cheese on the pizza .
never asked me if i needed any help .
they could be giving pizza away and i would pass .
save your money and do not go to this pizza hut .
this is really not much of a mall .
they also have hanging bbq ducks and roasted pork section along with a bakery .
however , this is more vietnamese and chinese focus .
homeless people on the corners asking for money .
stores are smelly and cold and dirty and old and creepy looking .
this is not even close to a mall .
nearly half empty .
while not impressive or particularly flavorful , the food sticks to your ribs .
it seems like fair bet for lunch if i 'm craving diner fare .
i left before i even finished picking out my color !
you are not here but two minutes .
and you are trying to hurt my business .
when welcomed i was greeted promptly and asked what i needed .
the young woman then continued to try to up sell me to gel polish .
recently changed management .
i miss christina !
the new manager is racist and has no customer service skills .
prices are good , but overall service is awful !
i tried everything !
as for the shredded beef , eh , just as unfortunate tasting .
all in all , an upsetting experience .
as a disclaimer , i 've only had what i 've mentioned above .
worst pho i 've ever had .
bubble tea also terrible , the worst i 've had .
and like the previous yelper wrote , this is not a vietnamese restaurant .
nothing crazy good or bad , just right .
this place gets a low _num_ stars due to the pathetic service .
i ordered the _num_ oz ribeye and was served a sirloin , instead .
she should know by looking at it .
this store was clean , server was polite and food was mediocre .
the wings were good , but the pork porterhouse was very dry .
also , the sirloin my daughter got was cooked properly and very tough .
the worst outback i 've ever been to .
this location always is horrible when it comes to service and food .
ive repeatedly had to send back steaks due to over cooking .
outback is usually a good chain but this location is horrible .
this location is not a good one .
the blooming onion was soggy before taking it out to the car .
i believe this was my worst restaurant experience ever .
it was the smallest , most pitiful little thing , undercooked and barely breaded .
we ate it , and did n't complain .
save yourself _num_ hours and go somewhere else !
very disappointed tonight at this outback location .
the lettuce was very brown and black and the croutons were very stale .
my meal arrived with many things missing off my baked potatoes .
i do n't know maybe it 's different elsewhere .
everything came out so slow !
we did n't get our food until _num_ pm !
big disappointment .
except for the last few times we 've eaten at this location .
and the blooming onion looked as if it had been found under the sea .
that is the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard .
that 's still a dumb thing to do .
extremely poor service , food was n't even average .
i 'm not even sure how that got through ... .
but never again would i step foot in here .
well _num_ minutes later i still had not gotten my food .
by the time i received it , everyone else had finished eating .
needless to say , lunch was horrible .
the worst chinese on planet earth .
the chicken they use must be jerky and i am not joking .
just not happy at all .
the shrimp toast was burnt and beyond fishy tasting .
burn the cottage !
i ordered chicken fried rice and pineapple chicken .
the chicken lacked flavor and was fatty for the most part .
the rice tasted like it was fried in old grease .
the egg roll was soggy and greasy , just nasty .
almost walked out of the place .
it was not bad , per se .
but , it certainly was not good .
the atmosphere gets a _num_ out of _num_ .
service gets a _num_ out of _num_ .
it 's one big room , tables lined up one next to the other .
nothing special .
there are better lunch choices in the area .
bathroom was nasty .
the rice was very bland and the chicken was more fat than actual meat .
i will not be visiting this place ever again !
my second visit here such a disappointment .
age tofu overcooked .
sushi rolls were ok but turned up before appetizers .
sad sad sad .
i get a thing for sushi and cold japanese beer .
every time , disappointed .
every time after , it has been just okay .
at least twice , the rice was old .
not good for what they charge .
like i requested , it was just so bland and greasy .
the only good thing on my plate was the carrots .
atmosphere is run down .
booths with holes with a warehouse feel .
the quantity of food is less .
the food did not taste as good as it used to .
i was disappointed .
i have eaten here twice and i will not be back .
my tuna roll was fine and thats the only reason for _num_ stars .
that being said it was not good enough to go here just for sushi .
worst place to eat ever !
the service gets one star but the food is n't worth it .
only thing good was the salad !
lol not hard to make a salad though .
honestly , the fact that this place has a _num_ star rating is appalling !
do n't go here ... why would you ?
this place is just disgusting .
usually i can suffer through bad sushi but this was awful !
old rubbery seaweed wraps , warm slimy sashimi , mushy rice .
just disgusting .
by far the worst sushi ever !
i have n't eaten anything all day .
service was horrible .
the only positive thing i can say is the shrimp vegetable dumplings .
one of the low end japanese express style of restaurants in the university area .
the hispanic sushi chef has no idea how to make sushi .
and the shrimp tempura tastes like it 's been cooked in beer batter .
i 'm a server myself and you dont rush customers .
the hibachi is mediocre .
i do n't know , that 's just me .
the hibachi is disappointing even for a cheap hibachi place .
i guess i will put in the towel and make this my last time .
the fried rice came with shrimp sauce and that seemed to be too runny .
the rice was mediocre and sticking together .
there was no flavor in the sushi whatsoever .
i was very disappointed .
i suggest that if you want some delicious japanese food then skip this location .
pay some more money and get better quality food elsewhere .
even an asian buffet can do better than this .
the sauce and vegetables was just okay , but definitely edible .
just so gross .
however , the sushi my friends ordered was pretty good !
this place could really use a remodel on its decor .
it 's not anywhere where i want to stay inside and eat .
i 'd recommend skipping their fried rice .
this place is by the worst place i have ever been .
disgusting !
i was in search of gyoza .
they have gyoza ... that is where it all goes south .
this place has _num_ stars for a reason .
everything is wrong with this place .
the inside is an even bigger train wreck of a mess .
the inside of the place has not been cleaned in a long time .
just crap everywhere that does not belong .
way too long for anything in the back to be fresh .
needless to say the gyoza was either steamed or deep fried .
sorry you ca n't do that .
gyoza is pan fried and then steamed .
so this trip was to prove that i would never go here again .
that is a bad sign .
i ca n't stress this place is a mess .
these people should not be running a restaurant at all !
my mom said if you have nothing good to say do n't say anything .
but all of it is pretty much in plain view .
it 's kind of weird .
really dirty place !
i 'm not gon na come again worst service ever !
why not this place since it was on the way home ?
i should have listened to my gut upon arrival .
i walked in the door to a very unpleasant fishy stench .
the smell was so bad i started looking around for the sanitation grade .
2nd warning i could not find it anywhere .
also i did n't get sick from the sushi : - ) .
their jumbo shrimp is not jumbo by definition .
you guys serve the worst fucking coffee in the world .
i have to say i just got my first bad pizza from this store .
my daughter ordered two large regular crust cheese pizzas and i brought them home .
this has been my `` go to '' pizza for _num_ years .
this specific store puts the name to shame .
i 'm so annoyed by it !
in my opinion this store most likely lacks thorough training and strong leadership .
the food is usually good but it probably wo n't be what you ordered .
horrible service .
placed my order and called back _num_ hours and canceled my order .
well yelp requires me to choose a star so i chose one .
thee worst !
my pizza is always late or something is always wrong with it !
service is rude and horrible .
worst pizza hut experience ever !
the only thing that was correct was the pizza that was cold .
but to others , beware .
food arrives cold and any sodas or extras ordered are usually left off .
please save yourself the trouble and do n't give this place your business .
would never go there again and i tell everyone i know to beware !
i felt that the mac-n-cheese was a little watery and was n't cheesy enough .
the stew beef was okay , i guess .
from my experience though , stay away from the stew beef .
and the guy on register was slow .
this location is definitely subpar !
slow service .
the yams were hard and dry on booth occasions .
my first time visiting and the food here was terrible !
bad soul food is what i got .
the fried chicken was okay .
but ... isnt that the case for the good hole in the wall places .
fried chicken was ok .
mac and cheese was not cheesy enough and it was watery .
this was not good mac and cheese .
some people may like that , but i do n't .
it did n't taste good at all .
some reviewers said that it would make me want to slap my mama .
the yams that i had was the worst .
watery and gross .
i realize that some places are a hit or miss .
i left this place with a bunch of food .
and when i got home ... my trash can received a bunch of it .
_num_ stars was all i could give .
there was the smell of weed when before i walked through the front door .
this place would not be a top choice place for soul food .
it was awful .
so much so , that i barely ate any of it .
i feel like i wasted my money .
i will definitely not be ordering from there again .
not impressed at all .
finally the cook came over and handed me the bag .
hate to see what the kitchen looked like .
cheap is definitely how i would describe the food .
i can definitely _num_ % say i will never return .
worst wendy 's ever .
i ordered apple pecan chicken salad , fries and iced tea .
i would never eat their salad again .
i would give them no star at all .
_num_ out of every _num_ orders are incorrect or missing something .
worst wendy 's i have ever seen .
not clean .
they can not get orders correct .
awful service and management seems to not care .
they do n't have a clue what they are doing .
i ordered mine for here and they gave it to me in a bag .
extremely disappointed !
worst .
it 's been like this for years and corporate must not care ... .
waited over _num_ minutes for a simple order .
worst service ever .
totally screwed my order up at the register .
have never been to a fast food chain restaurant with such a bad performance !
got home and realized they gave me the wrong drink and sandwich .
i come here often because i live very close .
( yes , this has happened to me ) .
but i will not be going back .
there 's a reason this place has such low ratings .
every single time you come here they mess up your order .
terrible customer service and just an awful place to be .
worst wendy 's .
worst i have ever been .
staff are clueless .
well , they refused and another vet clinic did it .
guess which clinic will have my continued business ?
this mcdonald 's , although updated , often will get big orders wrong .
this one is n't .
disappointed .
there were no exhibits .
no old anything .
this is awful .
i was so pissed .
i am also only giving a second star because of the house .
at least then i know it will be cared for & appreciated .
ok , i 'll get off my soap box now .
i stayed here for _num_ nights for business .
the location was great and it only took _num_ minutes to get to work .
i am unable to get in my room .
i do n't know what good she thought the suite would do .
i needed my stuff bottom line and before 8am .
nor did i think it would .
absolute worst hotel experience i have ever had .
stayed here for _num_ nights for business in january with nicole b .
however , that is not what happened .
the clerk said mine would be removed .
then she said she would try , and proceeded to make a phone call .
she later advised me that there was nothing she could do .
we are here for one night with our _num_ month old .
he slept in bed with us and cried all night long .
completely rude front desk staff , dirty hotel and unsafe area .
most seemed like it was an inconvenience for me to be disturbing them .
we did n't try it again on our other two mornings .
shame on you marriott .
worst hotel experience ever .
very thin walls and floors .
room by the stairs is absolutely horrible .
i would give this insurance company a zero if i could .
no notice , no letter , no phone call .
needless to say that was the end of our relationship with that scam company .
horrible !
their food is n't all that great .
when our meals finally came , they were cold and just nasty .
there is really nothing special about this place .
well drinks are $ _num_ each .
in addition , the food is not seasoned .
nothing special about the burgers .
chips and fries are just thrown in a fryer and then on the plate .
about the only plus is the outdoor seating and large number of televisions .
this place is just blah .
we went here on a weekday evening , and it was not crowded .
service was extremely slow for a slow night at the restaurant .
food is very bland , lacking good flavor .
service : horrible !
one time , okay maybe it 's a fluke .
unacceptable .
the burger was overcooked and dry ... just no , no , no !
the whole thing just seem like an inconvenience ... for everyone .
i did n't enjoy myself or the food .
the description said ... '' cheesy creamed spinach served with warm chips '' .
the dip would not even sit on the chip .
nothing remained on the chip .
just my bill and the server disappeared .
she did not know the menu .
her customer service skills were a _num_ on a scale 1-10 .
would n't even make eye contact with me .
he got _num_ refills .
dirty interior , poor service .
i just got a chicken salad and it was not memorable .
i went with _num_ of my coworkers .
my coworkers had s philly cheese steak , chili and a fried chicken salad .
it is all typical pub food .
my salad lettuce was wilted .
the service was friendly but a little slow .
was in charlotte for business and ate here with a few co - workers .
sad considering i could have gotten the same beer elsewhere .
also the sauce was horrible , and i have had hotter banana pepper rings .
overall just a bad experience .
they 're not very organized for watching games at all .
i also had a glass of there house merlot for $ _num_ .
not that great of service , food okay .
the food is not bad here but the service usually is awful .
however , i go less frequently and probably will not return .
the past _num_ out of ten times , the service is beyond awful .
she then dropped the drinks off and took our food order .
once again , i received poor service and they were not busy at all .
she never refilled my drink nor came back to check on us .
needless to say she got no tip and lost two customers .
there is never a manager present .
not good .
gave them _num_ chances and both times sucked .
the sandwiches are always dry .
also , the hostesses do n't seem to be very well trained .
food was pretty good but the service was so bad we could n't stay .
unacceptable and i will not be back .
do n't be fooled .
i mean how can you mess up a philly steak and cheese !
waiting here for _num_ minutes now and no one has waited on me .
this is frustrating .
not a drink or a menu .
no calls to say they were late or to apologize .
i suggest another cab company .
the driver was friendly and polite .
i got home in about _num_ minutes .
( it was at a 1/4 tank . )
the fare with a tip would 've been close to $ _num_ .
filling up the cab came to $ _num_ & no tip .
only if i 'm desperate .
service is completely inept .
after giving directions i waited ... _num_ minutes later no driver .
waited another _num_ minutes and at this point i was getting annoyed .
if i could go lower than one star i would .
horrible service !
and the cab driver did n't even know how to get to the airport !
completely unreliable and i will never use them again .
i feel ripped off by my driver this evening .
i 've never experienced this in my numerous other rides with yellow cab .
i feel totally ripped off and doubt i 'll ever use yellow cab again .
driver ca n't find my home then takes longest route possible .
be prepared to pay _num_ dollars for _num_ dollar trip .
i would rather walk than use service again .
there are plenty of other cab companies in charlotte .
dispatch refused to do anything .
i would have and should have walked !
it 's no wonder companies like uber are taking over their business .
called for a cab and the driver that called was at the wrong location .
called back , told someone was on the way , _num_ minutes and nothing .
complete waste of time and would never call back .
at _num_ am , i looked over the window , there was no cab .
i called yellow cab again , then she said there was no cab available .
i screamed as i would miss my flight to work .
she said she was trying but she had never notified me earlier .
so i thought i better to use a cab instead of calling friends around .
i explained very clearly to the cab driver who said nothing about the charge .
as i got to my house , he said he would charge me double .
finally , i was charged $ _num_ for a _num_ miles ride .
i did n't know if that was acceptable .
they were behind me and should n't be longer than me .
i still could not understand what was going wrong with these cab drivers .
btw , if these cab drivers hate their work , find another one .
very disappointing service .
i got the feeling my cab driver was racist towards me .
so , i needed a ride to the train station .
days in advance , i scheduled a pickup online .
even then , if you have decent shoes ... just run !
goodbye cabs , hello uber !
turns out the dispatch sent the cab to the wrong location .
how long does it really take to drive _num_ miles ?
turns out they sent the cab to the wrong location again !
i can not express how done i am with this company .
i am sure there is some `` longest route '' feature .
it was $ _num_ for the uber back to my hotel after dinner .
Negative
i wish i could give them a negative score .
sadly , her collar came off and was found across the road .
received confirmation of my order # _num_ and payment .
i now have - $ _num_ in my account !
( more than a month ago the item was received ) .
this by far is the worse store i have ever shopped !
could be a good course , but ... conditions are terrible .
greens were furry and in horrible shape .
bunkers had n't been groomed and were mostly dirt .
will not play here again .
the front nine is more old school and pretty boring .
the back _num_ seems ten times better .
unfortunately right now i would advise to stay away .
even though it 's affordable it is n't worth the money right now .
bottom line , this course is not worth the money .
management , either lower your prices or take care of your course .
very difficult to play with no local knowledge .
the course was in poor shape .
the fairways were absolutely rock hard .
none of this would be really a concern if it was priced fairly .
renaissance is by far the worst course i have played in the charlotte area .
if you like hitting off hard pan this is your place .
very little grass to tee off from .
the layout of the course is blah .
this place was more attractive when it was a dump .
horrible experience .
drove _num_ miles to purchase a membership for my mother-in-law .
i guess sams club has all our future business .
so costco you need to shape up and get your act together !
well i left with all but paper towels .
worst costco i have ever been in .
worst customer service costco i ever been to .
nothing special .
not particularly polite .
i love costco , but this location is the worst .
it is a disorganized mess .
total of three trips .
it reminded me that a review was long overdue .
this was the worst auto experiences i 've ever had .
i had to come back _num_ times and numerous calls were made .
basically , my tire pressure button kept on coming on .
they refused to pay the bill .
horrible experience , i will never return .
stray away from their stores !
i 'm just going to copy and paste my complaint e-mail ... .
my store experience was terrible .
went here on a sunday early morning to get my flat tire fixed .
got the dough nut but all the stores were closed at this hour .
looked online to find a place that was open on sunday .
took car to the closest shop and the guy there had horrible customer service .
he did not seem to care and said that i would have to wait .
no follow up on how long would it take .
will not be coming back here again .
if i could give no stars i would .
um no !
total labor and parts would be under $ _num_ .
it was horrible .
clearly was n't going to happen now .
it arrives , it is put on and i drive away .
no there was no money taken off at all .
no one is even trying to call to explain away .
just stupid working there !
wrong .
inside it just smelled fried .
not quite clean .
this place is not good .
where do i begin to explain this awful hotel ?
the major issue was that my toilet was broken .
why not just ask the hotel to fix it ?
finally , its location leaves something to be desired .
but still -- rough sauce .
stayed two nights recently and my room stunk of smoke .
the ac did n't do anything to help .
the bathroom towels were dirty and the hair dryer did n't work .
also , i could smell cigarettes in the room .
i would n't recommend more than _num_ night .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
mold and mildew .
breakfast is standard choice hotels breakfast every single day .
no change .
shower rod is really loose .
property really went downhill from when it was a hampton .
not a good biz !
it was a scary experience with people smoking , yelling & throwing batteries around .
a creepy paper that lacks integrity .
everything about this restaurant is wrong .
i checked in a hotel near this restaurant and ordered some food for delivery .
it took me _num_ calls to place the order .
french fries are soggy , soup is bland and salad is shit .
i completely hate this hotel .
had problems with this room service option the first two nights i was here .
house salad missing items , missing condiments , more just attention to detail .
decided to go back for a day _num_ bad mistake .
ordered the fillet it 's supposed to be one of their specials .
honestly i am done with these folks i 'll never use them again .
that was the most poorly spent money i have ever given a restaurant .
once it arrived , the food was cold and soggy .
i could n't eat any of it .
so they ca n't be bothered with amateur musicians .
`` you want to buy a guitar and possibly take lessons ?
customer service here is deplorable .
most workers seemed friendly but i got the one guy with a bad attitude .
he gave me lots of attitude and i remained polite through the whole experience .
i was so confused !
my advice is not to bother with it .
awful customer service , dirty , & shelves are rarely stocked correctly .
you 're better off going somewhere else if you can .
they take it back no problem .
i paid for the beginner ' s class for my _num_ week old pup .
also often times the larger dogs terrified my toy breed pup .
i insisted on another class as the policy stated .
the next thing is the grooming dept .
the 1st matter was there were mats under the inside of my pups legs .
well after a week it looked worse !
that i was unhappy with the service .
her nails were not touched .
me : hi , i need to get my cats nails trimmed , please .
me : i wo n't be back tomorrow .
fail !
i will never trust them with my pet again .
if you do , they will remove your pet from the property .
none of that is on their website .
the room also smelled bad , as did the hallway .
we got a refund and got the hell out of here !
well , there were about _num_ fans and 4-5 other people in casual attire .
_num_ ) curb appeal of bar is slim to none .
_num_ ) out of the way location - near the airport .
and , unfortunately , i must disagree with some of the current yelp reviews .
couldnt even think of the 3rd bite .
we did have dessert though , off a huge machine looking cart .
i wish they would serve that as dessert !
for crap food !
sorry for my comment tonight .
presentation of food was ok but quality did not match with the price .
for half the price , i would take it but not the full price .
no wonder it was not as crowded as it used to be .
i sent them a email with no respond .
i am not a big fan of people making out while i am eating .
which was the best item out of the _num_ .
it really felt that it came from a grocery store .
anywho thats my _num_ cents .
i would not come back here again .
sorry but this does n't measure up to what i call italian .
reservations meant nothing .
i do n't eat mushy pasta .
it was not .
i give this restaurant _num_ star because i have to on this site .
overpriced and overbearing ... food was plain .
_num_ .
ambiance - cheesy ... no , super cheesy .
_num_ .
_num_ .
very disappointing .
_num_ .
the food was so so and very expensive for what we got .
met a co-worker for lunch here one day .
nothing , and i repeat , nothing , on the buffet was edible .
the food was cold and tasted worse than olive garden .
it was horrific .
i mean , horrible !
i just can not describe the disappointment guys !
then , we got bread and olive oil .
cant go wrong with that .
what i anticipated was the champagne and sorbet , didnt get it .
didnt get the show when they open up your entrees in front of you .
the waiter actually told me i can get the cover myself .
i ordered the same thing i had last time , to keep it safe .
it was bad .
cold polenta .
it was really really bad .
horrible service ... .
my boyfriend asked for a sprite again .
oh , and my boyfriend asked for a sprite again .
but the decor is super dated and way to dark .
they could use real flowers for what they charge instead of plastic ugly ones .
service was good , i think it was the only good thing .
needless to say he ate a lot of bread ( cold ) .
he seated us in a booth and left , no menus ?
after _num_ minutes we were brought complimentary bruschetta , which was very nice .
a waiter approached to take our drink order , still no menus .
as for the fish , unfortunately i had to send it back .
i tried to flag my waiter , however , he was mia .
a little disappointing for a night that i thought would be nice .
their service is horrible and the food is downright gross .
all in all , pretty weak food .
delivery was on time to a hotel that i was stuck over night .
pizza good size , but too much oil .
i do n't know how its garlic sauce when it looked like pure oil .
got to a hotel late night as we missed a flight .
we were very tired and hungry .
instead of charging _num_ for $ _num_ they charged me $ _num_ each .
so i called the restaurant back and mentioned them about the over charge .
the thin and crispy was not .
lack luster taste , dipping sauce , not crispy , dipping sauce .
the stars on this review should come with dipping sauce for these guys .
terrible pizza .
such a disappointment .
plus ... they stuck my side of hot sauce in the pizza .
pissed me off .
i live _num_ miles from the location .
he did n't know and said they delivered all around me but not me .
seems like really poor business management and customer service !
i hate this walgreens !
otherwise it would have been a one star visit .
it can sometimes seem a little sketchy when shopping inside ... ex .
i have a horrible experience when i go in to this walgreens .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
ridiculous !
unfortunately there 's not another nearby location .
i could write a book on how horrible this place is .
just ... do n't .
bad neighborhood .
lazy maintenance workers .
they 'll make your life a living hell .
i 've lived here for _num_ months and have had nothing but terrible experiences .
to the venues credit , it wasnt terrible looking .
avoid this place if you can .
the worst part of the evening was by far the waitresses .
they just stopped coming by the table .
disgusting nasty place .
people just standing around not going any where never a great sign .
and they always forget your straw .
on top of that , the grilled chicken sandwich was cold .
nice guys , but slow !
only _num_ car ahead of mine , and i was promised _num_ minutes .
i didnt ask for any fancy synthetic oil , and it cost $ _num_ !
if i could give them a zero i would .
they could not have put it on my car .
i wo n't be taking my service here ever again .
she said that she was unable to reach him .
fortunately , we did n't hear the dog again .
the other hotels in the area had their shuttles running without trouble .
probably wo n't stay here again .
this was possibly the most disgusting hotel i 've ever stayed in .
the breakfast buffet was nearly inedible .
horrible hotel .
breakfast did n't have protein , which is a no no for me .
and water pressure was poor so i never felt clean .
i did n't get any rest , which makes this hotel horrible bad .
very disappointing .
this year only breads and yogurt .
check-in was a breeze and i was in my room in minutes .
the room appeared to be clean and modern but the beds were awful .
the pillows were a little on the stiff side , too .
do n't stay here .
bottom line ... keep looking for a different place to stay .
other things were not so great though .
tip : check the bag before you drive away from the window .
the staff is ok ... slow but ok .
would you like to try our hot chocolate today ? ''
um ... no i do n't want a hot chocolate ... it 's july !
why would i want a hot chocolate ?
worst mcdonalds ever .
ordered a sundae , milk shake , small fry and medium coke .
poor customer service at its highest .
slow service and could not get a receipt .
i wish i could give this location zero stars .
we just had the rudest experience here .
the asshole taking our order could 've be bothered with our order .
i walked in , and i could not figure out where to walk first .
worst worst worst customer service .
this is the only place they used their card in charlotte .
my dad said he thought something was a bit off .
we wiped everything down with a baby wipe .
no one should have to apologize every time they come to your table .
my family and i will not visit this establishment again .
if i could give it _num_ stars , i would .
upon going in , the parking lot was trashy .
_num_ tables who came in after us got served first .
the waiter ended up getting our drinks wrong .
save yourself the trouble and skip coming here .
the worst ihop i 've ever entered .
they started with checking my tire pressure and rotating the tires .
i should probably get in replaced , but its not urgent .
trust the guy with the grease on his hands .
not the one in the pretty blue polo .
it costs _num_ dollars .
being a aaa member will not get you a discount .
no big deal .
the reason i put only one star is because of the customer service .
nothing special .
very run down .
i stopped to air up my tires .
the sandwich was cold .
it was 10pm on a saturday and the front door had been locked .
it looked like a typical bar only it was completely empty .
he responded again `` members only , you have to know someone '' .
not for you !
Negative
negative _num_ stars .
this place sucks .
very slow .
poor customer service .
each time i go , i think it will be better .
do not spend your money at this establishment .
rude !
i would rather order on-line rather then return back to his establishment .
made a reservation _num_ weeks in advance for a _num_ way from the airport .
the price came in too high , so i called to cancel .
very disappointed in this service !
i called to find out what had gone wrong .
i asked that management follow up with me asap .
can not recommend , will not use again .
i asked him to please not throw our bags because these are personal items .
i did n't throw the bag !
this is just bs ! ''
the staff was n't that helpful overall and the paying issue is just ridiculous .
the `` shuttle service '' is crap .
no `` sorry i 'm late .
at the hotel , the whole place smells like a burning tire yard .
if you have a choice , i would skip this place .
my boyfriend and i stayed here one night during our road trip .
this was the worst hotel we stayed at the whole time .
it 's defiantly not terrible , and you can sleep there for a night .
the breakfast was okay , normal hot continental breakfast .
worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
but that 's not even the worst part !
they do n't deserve even _num_ star !
no customer service at all .
left a very bad impression .
the bathrooms are gross .
the whole hotel is old and musty .
their pictures are a false representation of what it really is .
please do n't waste your money staying here .
there was a smoke smell throughout as well as a garbage smell .
i got into my room and the room looked clean at least .
nothing wrong with the water pressure but my toilet would n't flush correctly .
i was too exhausted to go back downstairs and complain to the desk .
i 'm so glad i did n't pay to stay at this hotel .
make sure to get your pricing in writing .
i was quoted a price to later find out it was twice as much .
not to mention they are _num_ weeks out to do the work .
can not recommend unless you want a new driveway .
stayed here while in charlotte for a meeting .
first impressions were not good .
the lobby and breakfast room are being renovated and are a mess .
not professional at all .
shower only , no tub .
light over bathroom sink blew out .
no lamps on each side of the bed .
hubby had to cover his head so i could stay up late reading .
check out and on our way !
was offered another room but moving out would just be another hassle .
first strike is being attached to a shady days inn .
first shrimp tasted very fishy , the rest were better .
so i gave it a shot but i doubt i 'll be back .
meh , i 've had better .
went here for lunch the other day and the place was packed .
seated right away and was met by the server instantly with chips .
ordered the combo place of tostada , enchilada and taco .
hot like it was sitting under the lamp too long .
flavors were just ok .
food is overly greasy , salsa is watery , chips are mediocre and limited .
needless to say we are still on the hunt .
the service was very prompt and polite .
i could n't bring myself to even eat it .
the beans were also watery underneath all the yellow cheese .
we paid _num_ for _num_ people and one margarita , so it was pricey .
service was minimal and not unfriendly but not too welcoming .
sauce surrounding it seemed like just thin bland tomato paste .
they are downright mean and lazy .
same corporate owners and recipes but better staff .
i do n't eat the salsa , so i ca n't speak to that .
i told them fine and walked out with my change .
the manager should never ever tell a paying customer that they are badly educated .
ridiculous .
i guess my azteca days are over .
waiting _num_ minutes when we were told a _num_ minute wait .
my dining companion had chicken fajitas , i had the chicken taco salad .
the taco salad was not very good .
my dining companion had chicken fajitas , i had the chicken taco salad .
the taco salad was not very good .
so went an ordered tacos to go .
the food was extremely cold and way over priced for the quality of food .
i will never waste time or money again in this place .
used to be really good , but i guess they got too comfortable .
i asked them to make fajitas spicy and for some reason it was sweet ?
this is probably the worst customer service i have ever received .
called and made a reservation for _num_ on thursday for tonight .
they wrote it down for the complete wrong date .
bar service is awful as well .
never coming back and still have n't even eaten .
no point in sending them back because they 'll just spit in it .
it 's a different combination plate of _num_ carne asada tacos _num_ .
so i choose shredded beef instead .
i did not try the guacamole .
i ate very little .
shredded beef tasted very bland in both the enchiladas and taco .
how can u mess that up , right ?
wrong !
shredded cheddar cheese throughout .
it was nasty nasty nasty .
the guy here - louis - was rude and racist .
bathroom horrible condition .
only stopped here because we were in a hurry .
i slept in and missed it .
the bathroom had no ventilation and the window in the room does n't open .
horrible business practices and horrific behavior by management .
staff is incredibly rude and disrespectful .
avoid !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
what a mistake !
the first room that we received was horrible !
ended up at this dive because us airways had many people miss flights .
the airline said it would be 30-40 dollars .
ummm no !
_num_ of the pillows had black stains on the pillow cases .
overall it is average stay .
it is an extremely stinky motel .
it smells like urine at times too .
this motel probably just renovated their rooms .
our next stop would be to florida .
so i asked to see a room on the second floor which was better .
smoking so much and i 'm allergic .
after this weekly rental is over i 'm out of here !
the heat that comes out is cold air .
this is by far the worse i 've been to .
do n't waste your time here !
only asks other people if they need any vacuuming .
the patio doors has homemade locks .
feels very uncomfortable living here .
i stayed here for a bit over a week .
it is a very sketchy place .
refused to clean the rooms .
it is the worse place i 've live .
this place sucks .
i wish i read yelp before coming here .
i can accept cheap prices as long as i feel safe .
i do n't feel safe here .
i was n't given any sort of discount or any real apology .
not worth the hassle .
i felt strangely out of place by the staff .
i was given dirty looks and my questions received no answers .
very large selection , all very neatly organized .
the staff was terribly rude .
they did not honor the sale price that was clearly posted above the suits .
they advised me it was labeled wrong .
horrible staff , horrible company all together .
i have n't gone back .
short staffing and bad attitudes !
this is the absolute worst waffle house ever !
i 'm never going back .
this place is horrible !
we are from new england , which is entirely void of these places .
this place was just plain depressing .
i walk in and sit down .
finally , there was a waitress who was smiling and friendly .
we walked in and we were surprised that they had seating available right away .
we sat down and immediately felt uncomfortable because the a/c was on full blast .
we told her that we were too cold to stay .
really bad service .
grabbed my waffle and threw it away .
they had attitudes and did not seem happy that i said anything .
maybe , i just went on the wrong night or something .
oh how the mighty have fallen .
the wednesday lunch buffet was killer and the weekend breakfast buffet was equally awesome .
also , the security was not as sharp as it used to be .
and what really surprised me was that there was no pole dancing !
for a club like this , and no pole ?
boring !
this place is pretentious and over priced .
the girls there have no talent and do n't really care .
worst place i 've ever been to no service or women .
i would never come in this place ever again .
women are not attractive and staff is even worse .
beer is almost $ _num_ with no girls in sight .
bartender played confused , made typical excuses for lazy dancer behavior .
finally bored we requested our check .
otherwise , generally sub par club .
would avoid at all costs .
hard to find one to get a dance .
hard to believe someone got that drunk on the overpriced watered down drinks .
sorry but my dollars will be spent where my business is appreciated !
and refused to refund me .
this location used to be a reliable quick stop for lunch .
not so much anymore .
they were wrong .
however , the food is disappointing .
unfortunately , i was very disappointed .
i like my pulled pork tender , but this was taken way too far .
this is below average carolina barbeque .
i made a special trip for a quick lunch and was very disappointed .
i have tried it several times and just never have been impressed .
for good bbq , try mac 's instead .
this is based off just one visit when i ordered the bbq chicken .
the bbq had a sour background taste .
worst meal i had in months .
had good flavor and fell right off the bone .
unfortunately i chose the mac and cheese for my side .
maybe it was cooked two days ago , maybe it was cooked yesterday .
the cheese and butter had separated from the pasta completely .
oh boy ... where we disappointed ?
the pork was cold and barely warm .
i did n't care about the sauce , it was very sour .
gross !
the only reason i am giving two stars were hush puppies .
i love little local family dives , but this place was a miss .
one of the worst bbq i 've ever had !
old and very dry !
wouldnt go back if you payed me $ _num_ !
salt on salt on salt .
i am more a fan of regular cole slaw .
sorry for the feedback but i wish nothing but good fortune to them .
this was our 2nd time dining here .
there was n't much of a wait and we were sat promptly .
that i just asked that my meal be placed to-go at that point .
needless to say we will not be returning to dine here anytime soon .
so , this is our first time trying a true southern restaurant .
i will admit it 's not bad .
if you are into vinegar style bbq then this is your place .
the sign said $ _num_ .
i ordered , and the lady told me it would be $ _num_ .
and to top it off , the hot dog was n't even good .
will never do business with these rude people again .
and they actually put mustard in the slaw , yuck !
way hotter than what would come out of the smoker .
the ribs were lacking in flavor , no smoke ring and overcooked .
the bark was soggy .
i had the rib , chicken combo and a side of baked beans .
the chicken was not bad fell off the bone and had some flavor .
i have nothing good to say about the sides .
the pork plate was well cooked , but lacked any real flavor .
for all the rave reviews , this place falls flat .
last week i was in the area and stopped in for lunch .
it just was n't what i was expecting or what should have been served .
i figured how in the world i never heard of this place .
or $ _num_ fried catfish sandwich .
all of the sudden it does n't look so bargain anymore .
i just was n't feeling fried catfish or bbq .
the entire dish was just ... bad , rice was barely warm .
my sides were a lot more natural looking , collard green and cabbage .
my coworkers opted for the complimentary dessert which was peach cobbler .
cheap , lousy truck stop food .
everything on the menu is either frozen , or comes from a can .
just tried the place because i was close .
chicken pot pie was decent .
fried okra was not that great .
mac and cheese treated like out of a box .
corn bread was ok.
cobbler was mediocre .
we ordered delivery here at work and it was delivered .
she did n't even speak or smile .
i do n't need bad service and mediocre food !
it 's a sandwich shop and the sandwich was n't good .
i waited and after _num_ minutes someone from the kitchen gave me my food .
the first order i got was the chicken cesar salad in the tortilla shell .
to say my lettuce was drowning in dressing would be an understatement .
i dipped my fork into the salad and it just disappeared !
the potato salad was awful !
maybe its supposed to be mashed potatoes covered in mayo but it was horrendous !
a little strip mall sandwich shop with a country cooking feel .
unfortunately that soup was the best part of the meal .
they made no apologies .
nothing special ... an oil change and possibly tires rotated .
i would give a zero star if given the chance .
they also tried to add _num_ for labor on a basic oil change .
they should be ashamed of themselves .
bad bad bad !
i left their establishment and went on my weekend trip .
however , i do not want them anywhere near my car .
did he offer to change my oil again ?
how dishonest !
if i could give no stars i would .
30-40 minutes and saw a total of _num_ dancers .
the drinks were good but way expensive .
just not a place i would recommend .
we did n't even get past the guy who answered the phone .
the customer service is absolutely terrible in all of my experiences .
did not consider that telling me where said water would be would be helpful .
i also purchased a living social to get golfing lessons .
why bother even making an appointment ?
driving range is good , balls fair , but customer service is very poor .
i wo n't be back .
the cheese was n't melted .
yep , they 'd made my order twice .
dumb .
very disappointed !
there was no one up front to take orders .
so totally did n't realize these existed on this side of the country !
yeah ... the menu here is a bit random .
sorta like arby 's .
for a few moments there was no one behind the counter at all .
i probably wo n't be back any time soon , especially not this location .
extremely disappointed with this visit .
for _num_ minutes we waited and not one of them served .
then one person got his food and to my surprise the order was wrong .
when we drove up to the window , no one was there .
it did not look good for the place .
this is not the first time we 've had such bad service here .
i was more disappointed to see the crumbs and dust on my dash .
when i got home i found out they had not vacuumed , at all .
tomorrow i will be taking my car elsewhere for yet another detailing .
they barely wiped down anything inside the car at all .
i wo n't go back .
not worth the damage that was done .
they installed two new h & c in our home _num_ years ago .
keep in mind it 's _num_ degrees outside .
not my previous service company who installed the units less than _num_ yrs .
i do not suggest using this company .
this company came recommended but i had a really bad experience .
stuck me for another $ _num_ then a separate $ _num_ .
horrible service .
also , they noted there was an oil leak .
after an hour and half , i asked about my car .
let me say i really like dollar tree .
just disorganized and ridiculous .
i have taken my car in to this location before for new tires .
wo n't ever be returning here , what a headache .
as much as i love kfc , this store is very disappointing .
she admitted things were n't going smoothly that day .
but make sure you get a receipt and check your orders before you leave !
i was quickly reminded why i do n't eat here .
this was not something i could roll with .
luckily for me she kindly let me replace my drink with a second side .
perhaps the manager should learn how to read .
if i could leave _num_ stars , i would .
nobody with such horrible customer service should be in the food industry .
this place is slow as shit .
waited _num_ minutes for food .
was n't even busy and wait was forever .
long wait for food .
awful experience .
other than that the experience would have been a zero .
built my own as i usually do , and it comes pretty quickly .
this pizza was a bland as it could be !
i mean , how is sweet italian sausage bland ?
the entire pizza just was not very good .
sounds pretty perfect , take out for $ _num_ including delivery and tax !
awkward !
thank god this next time i was only on hold for under a minute .
this experience will deter me from ordering from this location .
i will never order pizza from this place again .
he came back to tell me the order was never made .
starving '' .
i went downstairs and she was n't at or around her car .
if you want me to call every _num_ minutes , i can do that .
if that does n't keep you on your toes , nothing will .
room was large , bathroom was nice .
( i just kept thinking , is it going to cave in ?
this is absolutely the worst hotel experience i have ever encountered !
trust me , this place is not worth the money .
Negative
if i could give a negative star review i would .
do not stay here .
that is called shady and wrong .
the nasty smell in our room was overwhelming .
our room did not smell .
that lasted less then one day due to the smell .
i contacted hilton corporate and no response !
they deserve zero stars !
late night bartender was awesome but the breakfast restaurant was understaffed .
this time she cheated on me .
but today april _num_ i have see it all !
i find that extremely disturbing .
no please avoid .
avoid !
i travel for business _num_ weeks out of the year .
this hotel is by far the worst experience i have ever had .
by far the worst travel experience i have ever had .
expected better quality from embassy suites but was very disappointed .
will not stay at embassy suites ever again .
on-site steakhouse was disappointing .
not the best embassy suites i 've stayed at but not the worst either .
maybe the second worst ?
the guest room i was given is where they lost the stars .
the room i stayed in had definitely seen better days .
the bad .
our room had an ac leak .
the airline gave us a voucher to stay at embassy suites for the night .
fast forward to our _num_ minute wait time outside by the hotel shuttles .
finally , someone came from the back and i gave her my voucher .
my room was n't ready so i waited in the center space .
unacceptable .
not up to the hilton standards for sure .
it is no wonder this is the cheapest hilton property in charlotte .
i wish _num_ stars was an option .
garbage hotel .
internet worked for _num_ minutes then stopped .
i 've been here for a whole _num_ minutes and i 'm not happy .
makes for a very unwelcome feel .
this hotel is stuck in the _num_ 's in terms of their meeting spaces .
bad lighting that is annoying , bright and dull at the same time .
unfortunately this was a forced choice by our conference location .
welcome to _num_ and throw that bad boy in for free .
cornbread , stale .
peaches , canned .
but basil 's will no longer be getting our business .
there are so many things wrong here .
a good _num_ minutes from ordering drinks until you actually get them .
just do n't get your hopes up to high .
skip this one .
saigon palace is the first vietnamese restaurant i 've eaten at in charlotte .
the egg roll was mediocre .
priced around $ _num_ , i am sorry , but i expect more .
ok place , but nothing special .
the spring rolls were decent , as was the dipping sauce .
seriously , _num_ star rating .
boy was i wrong .
let me break it down for ya .
expensive as hell .
_num_ for a regular ?
the food was all just meh for a big price tag .
food is awful and so greasy .
i do n't get the _num_ star rating here .
not bad , but not the worse .
this was hands down the best thing we ate .
my _num_ year old son loves pho but with broth and noodles only .
i will stop at wendy 's before i go back to this place .
i 'm not really sure what draws so many people here .
but honestly , i did n't dare touch the buffet .
it did n't look clean .
neither did the tables or restaurant as a whole .
it was edible , but not flavorful .
i was not impressed and there are two better vietnamese places up the road .
if anything , it 's nonexistent .
the pho is mediocre .
the pho was very bland and tasted like water .
our first waitress was very sweet but so quiet i could barely hear her .
also she did n't speak much english so it was hard to understand her .
again , did n't speak much english but he was nice .
now our third waiter was a complete asshole !
maybe that explains his disgusting attitude !
rude !
he comes back and slides the little cup of chili on the table .
rude !
unless your job is that miserable .
not to mention we had no refills .
the steak was only okay , and a bit dry .
think of a chef 's salad , but worse .
mashed potatoes had the consistency of paste and were cold .
i 'm really confused by this place .
the food was great , but the service was horrible !
then the table next to us gets potatoes .
then a crazy amount of time to get our credit card back .
the atmosphere was lackluster and the entire experience was bad .
worst restaurant ever .
all for only an $ _num_ price tag .
no bread included complimentary .
unsure how they are still in business .
unfortunately will never come back .
an hour later still nothing .
when we finally got out food it was n't worth the wait .
the absolute worst service i 've ever experienced .
he was joined by our true waiter at this time so he backed off .
and walked away .
i then asked for the manager and again , kindly addressed him as well .
had to take it as to-go after waiting nearly _num_ minutes for another steak .
it was tough , over grilled and rubbery .
disappointed !
and i 'm not getting there steaks to my house either !
hubby done with his dinner , wine bottle finished .
ok , this seemed a bit pricey but reasonable .
i dropped my car off and they took it in no problem .
i went inside and explained that i needed them to check the pressure .
i was told to drive a few miles and it would go off .
unreal .
scam artists ( pep boys ) is more like it .
there was coolant steaming all over the engine .
that 's not enough to get more than a star from me .
tl ; dr : do not come here .
an inspection is typically what , _num_ minutes tops ?
my car had a few problems , sure what car does n't ?
literally takes him _num_ minutes to patch my tire , _num_ minutes .
world ' slowest oil change .
people just sitting in the shop doing nothing .
_num_ .
time - they are very very slow .
_num_ .
_num_ .
staff and customer service - they are just below average .
_num_ .
but i also do n't want you think they are very cheap .
i purchased more than i would need just so i would n't run out .
i ended up with _num_ full bottles left over and _num_ half bottles .
not `` you used these bottles i ca n't return them '' .
i waited _num_ hours and _num_ minutes for my car to be serviced .
do n't waste your time at this location .
this is the worse place for customer service .
i 've been waiting _num_ hours no for a scheduled oil change .
lack of customer service .
on the weekends , this place is crazy .
people are packed in here , and parking becomes quite difficult .
the only place i really appreciate is the vintage clothing .
would n't recommend right off gate from our initial phone conversation .
worst vet i have ever been too .
so why did you e-mail me a birthday card the very next day ?
i ca n't even believe this is the same place we are all reviewing .
overall my meal was $ _num_ - and yucky .
i will not be going back .
it was terrible .
the mushrooms were canned , and i absolutely hate canned mushrooms .
the cheese - i do n't even know if it actually had cheese .
it did not taste at all like avocado .
the rice tasted old and the refried beans were eh .
however sanitation has gone to shit .
they just got an _num_ grade .
no longer a customer .
i 've been eating here for years , through the second owner .
whatever you do , do not use this storage facility !
the staff are rude and completely unhelpful .
they close too early and the prices on the used records are ridiculous !
the prices are way too high for use cd 's .
their new record section sucks and is way over priced .
i really do not see me going back anytime soon .
this place here ... ummmm not so much .
bad customer service too .
over priced , low quality food .
frankly , i 'd rather get something from the grocery store deli counter .
i paid for _num_ people and it was _num_ $ .
subs tasted just like subway to me , except more expensive .
nothing like a northern deli shop .
i bought a groupon for four gel manicures , really wish i had n't .
their process to take off your existing gel polish is terrible .
on my second visit , i asked for someone different , same thing .
do n't waste your money here .
disgusted that i wasted my time .
first time getting gel nails was this past saturday .
then the next day it split open .
$ _num_ for this ?
why did n't she catch it before i left ?
waste of money .
horrible experience !
the services was not only poor so was the quality .
it was not worth the time and i will never go back .
they can not polish a nail correctly .
is n't that nail school _num_ ?
i 'm assuming there is a reason they do n't have regular customers !
horrible .
they switched the bottle , finally but it was too late .
they are not competent nail technicians .
i would not advise going to this place ever !
awful awful awful !
i just left there w/ the worst pedicure of my life .
did n't i just pay you to get rid of that ?
total nightmare .
, but bad food ( fake crab in crab rangoon !
with ketchup for sauce ) small portions and cheap ingredients .
i will not be returning to china wing .
gives a whole new meaning to cheap chinese .
never going back !
ordered the bulgogi , fried dumplings and crab rangoons .
the rangoons and dumplings were pretty decent .
Positive
i had to throw it out .
do n't think i will be going back .
horrible food , worse service .
nasty , you can see nasty in the kitchen .
not good korean .
it is more expensive .
i still do n't understand why people return here for food .
inconsistent quality of food & service .
i would n't eat here even if it was free .
nothing knocked me out , but all was fine .
horrible food .
i just left paying with a empty stomach .
i dunno how it gets _num_ stars .
never do delivery from this place .
the food is terrible and the service matches the food .
so i just arrived from miami on business and i am starving !
needless to say , i was sold !
service is awful as well .
chicken tikka masala was neither sweet nor spicy enough .
very bad food .
edible , but not really recommended for the lunch buffet .
edit : one more thing .
it was terrible .
one of the worst restaurants i have ever eaten at .
there was no spice involved .
the tikka masala had no cream consistency to it today .
i 've exhausted my attempts .
i will not eat here again .
very mediocre and the food was dry and unappealing .
do n't bother .
everything is very tired and the food is lacking in too many ways .
they were n't really set up .
my wife ate from the buffet and she was a bit disappointed as well .
the service is lacking , the original indian dishes are lacking .
my wife cooks indian food , she grew up in india .
the ambiance is lacking a little but it is passable .
i could n't recommend this place any more , like i used to .
after this visit , i had to share with yelp .
ordered delivery to hotel .
it is so busy that it would benefit the store and the poor personal .
the score is based on lack of staff not how they act .
it was nasty .
i explained to him i ate it in hunger but it was disgusting .
i chose the buffet because i wanted some vegetables .
this would have been ok except that they charged over $ _num_ for it .
if i go back , i should probably choose from the menu .
unfortunately , the search continues .
she had baked chicken , i the fried chicken .
not sure how the mac n cheese could receive such good reviews .
no , this is n't the place to satisfy your craving for orange chicken .
fried chicken , fried shrimp , fried tilapia , fried catfish .
i stopped in for a late lunch .
the service was lacking .
the green beans were simply prepared with no seasoning whatsoever .
the catfish was rather bland .
again , i 'm not sure if the sauce was prepared in-house .
overall , i think this place does southern fried soul fairly well .
as for it becoming a regular stop , probably not .
food is okay , but staff is extremely rude .
the catfish on the buffet was sub par .
pasta salad was nothing special .
i 'm pretty sure my fried chicken is better .
skin was crispy , but just nothing to brag about .
i 'd probably go back for lunch .
update : i went for lunch and wo n't be going back .
the `` buffet '' was sad and pathetic .
they only had a few things that did n't look appetizing .
i barely had any chicken , mostly skin .
there ai n't no soul in this place !
there are just too many other options .
however , everything is else is average .
the greens tasted like they just pulled it out fresh water .
there was absolute no salt or any spices added .
i would n't waste my money here ever again .
horrible !
i was soooo wrong !
if they would have just gave me fresh chicken from the start ?
i 've had much better fried chicken at bojangles down the street .
i will not return to this place again .
i will not come back .
my room didnt have a trash can !
the couch bed was full of springs and cover !
but it was roomy and had alot of channels no elevator or handicapped equivalent .
the manager , michael is not a people person .
i ended up only staying for a week at this extended type of hotel .
i checked out the room before i accepted it .
so then there is the room it self .
so you ca n't even open the door without pulling up on the handle .
then the a/c and heater unit .
as time went by they really seemed to lose touch .
each replacement show worse that the one prior .
personally i ca n't stand to listen to them for more than five minutes .
it is like they try way to hard to act like idiots .
they are offensive and should not be on the radio .
the music is crap now .
the floor tile was ordered and took almost a month to be delivered .
_num_ star is too many .
worst bank i 've ever been involved with .
take it from someone that went there ... and wished i had n't .
i found the student body and administration sorely lacking .
they were not helpful at all .
hate to do it but the service here is an absolute nightmare .
no problem , we 'll get it fixed .
one week later , get a call to come get the car .
get a call the next day , oops did n't make the delivery truck .
truly an embarrassment for my wife to drive .
a little disappointed that i wasted an hour for that .
this was only because my husband really wanted to keep that vehicle .
you hire incompetent people .
had that occurred we would have lost brakes all together .
so disappointed .
i would n't even give one star .
when in to see what they would pay me for my car .
ended up having to buy a new with my own money .
i told the sales manager no , and then presented the certificate .
i am not willing to be taken advantage of .
young female manager very unprofessional and rude !
make sure you order your pizza _num_ hours before you want it .
i will not be ordering from this location again .
i wish i could give this place a _num_ star .
so we got soggy , burnt bread .
i used to eat at this place quite regularly but , no more .
( i didnt have my car that evening ) .
they 're literally _num_ mins from my house .
second incident months later was they messed up my order .
this is not authentic chinese food .
the sweet and sour sauce is bitter and stale .
the mix of flavors with the vegetables is very off .
the only item that was passable was the orange chicken .
the second star is just for effort and not being overly salty .
my wife and daughter ordered sesame chicken a few days ago .
for this she lost three good customers as we ordered from this place frequently .
this is by far the worst chinese place in charlotte .
i regret going here , never again !
ok things happen , i understand .
be very careful .
not even in the home and office section .
always crowded , loud and most of the time it smells like shit .
the hamburger was dry .
very poor !
i left without getting anything .
i watched _num_ other customers just give up and leave before i did .
it 's been a very long time .
there were not many people inside eating as well .
what , no tomato at least ?
i practically threw away the sandwich ... it was only $ _num_ .
i usually love bk , this one is sub-par .
bad value overall .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the cheesesteak my wife ate was tough and had a bad flavor .
also , the condiments were very poor .
house recipe brand sucks !
_num_ .
a hot dog should not be served on a cheesesteak roll .
i just ate the dog without the bun .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the fries were soggy .
wife and i visited for the first time under new owners .
we were starving and filled up on peanuts .
horrible .
no courtesy to the customers what so ever .
by then i told him to get the money back .
no , that 's not a fresh burger , got ta be frozen .
it was disappointing .
grab some beers .
fried mushrooms delish .
let em cool , otherwise you 'll burn ur balls off .
homemade ranch , i think .
i would n't go back .
it was a stop for food on the way to somewhere .
my visit was short and not sweet at all !
i wish there was an option to not give a single star !
first and last !
nasty nasty nasty .
the worst manicure i have ever received !
the staff was not very welcoming when we walked in .
one staff member was even sitting in the pedi chair talking , not greeting .
he did n't trim , nor ask if i wanted my nails trimmed .
horrible !
needless to say i am very unsatisfied and will never be back .
poor service , unorganized .
wanted same color on nails and toes and they managed to mess that up .
tried to pass gel base off as color .
rude and expensive .
you 'll get a better deal elsewhere !
however , dealing with there sketchy service department afterwards is terrible .
they avoid answering any and all questions .
sure it was my fault for not checking over everything , but seriously ?
these people are really dismissive , contrary , and unfriendly .
no sale .
they consistently said i did n't have a leak .
Negative
i wish i can give a negative star .
i am purchasing the car , not the dealership 's honor .
no , we have to do it at _num_ .
_num_ .
i will definitely avoid the dealership in the future unless they change their manager .
if you really want an audi , go elsewhere .
they have lost my business .
will not be returning to this dealer ever again even .
worst car buying experience ever !
total nightmare .
i could see how they lied and never ordered his car .
horrible sales staff .
walked in and the salesman could not have been more rude or dismissive .
one would think , he would want to sell a car , no ?
in fact , no other salesman even offered to help .
there were more salespeople than customers .
these guys are clueless .
he apologized and asked me to come back .
service , staff were all top notch .
it 's too bad .
disclaimer : i do n't eat seafood !
no , after all this is the south .
the fried squash was not the best i 've had .
but , it really was more of a dessert than a side dish .
like , maybe the best i 've ever had !
the prices are low .
the decor is horrible .
very rude , it 's not all of them .
just a select few .
then i gave her my coupon .
she was rather curt after i gave it to her .
absolutely no reason for me to go back to the place .
no more creamy texture .
disappointed .
ice cream does not taste good and is way over priced .
this is the worst ice cream i 've ever had .
it tasted like sweet cream with chocolate chips .
very plain .
if you like sweet cream with food coloring , this is your place .
cheap greedy owners alert !
very over priced and portions are very small .
it was crazy , and i wish they would fix this .
i mean it is fast food .
my fries were burnt and my burger tasted like sour fish .
i took one bite and had to throw it away .
the meat selection is n't bad , but you must check the date .
you 'll pay more at other stores , but you wo n't regret it .
i purchased a few things two i was very excited for .
hummus and my boyfriends fave - red velvet cake .
no biggie .
-no prices on the ground turkey ( about 10-15 packs ) .
rant over ... sorry about that .
went and got the $ _num_ box of tenders .
hardly any chicken and severely over cooked .
took pictures to send to corporate .
i dont know if this restaurant is still open .
we sometimes go there when we 're too lazy to go somewhere else .
there 's a bolt sticking in my tire .
only _num_ at the tire place , but _num_ minutes out of my day .
and a crappy car wash at that .
if they ca n't even do the basics correctly what more do you expect ?
no apologies or anything back for customer service .
the staff was completely unprofessional .
the doctor is completely incompetent .
this is a horrible health services .
just have your sister call and make another appointment . ''
did you do something really bad to her ? ''
most disappointing and frustrating doctors office i 've ever been to .
the facility itself looks like it was built _num_ years ago and never renovated .
i could go on , but i think you get the point .
now the bad - everything else !
the driver showed up full of excuses and smelled horribly of cigarettes .
if i had known that i would have not ordered extra rice .
the chow mein was not chow mein .
it was steamed vegetables on top rice !
the teriyaki chicken - very dry , very bad tasting .
no teriyaki sauce .
finally , the egg rolls ( vegetable ) .
disgusting .
all cabbage and tasted like it was boiled .
if i could have given this place zero stars i would .
poor customer service .
i requested no carrots and no celery in my dish .
i wo n't be back .
you do n't feel welcome at this place .
but for a couple out to dinner , avoid it .
seems like the wait staff needs help and the kitchen as well .
the easiest thing to say about this store is : do n't bother .
yes , that 's harsh but sadly true .
crap , crap , crap .
save yourself the trip ... nothing to see here , folks !
the place was nearly empty and the food was practically inedible .
i trust chad 's reviews but i neglected to take the date into consideration .
the quality that they had four years ago is not here any more .
for the second plate , i tried some others .
in the ice cream case was a sliced pecan pie .
cheap buffet eats .
gel polish should not do that .
i 'm so disappointed .
needless to say i will not be going back .
did n't even bother complaining .
i 'd rather just keep someone else from making the same mistake .
sadly it was not a good experience .
please do n't go to this nail salon .
worst nail service ever !
my top over coat is not smooth .
she filed me so hard she cut me deep .
very dirty salon , equipment , floors , everything .
do n't waste your time or money .
this place is terrible .
checked the reviews here and was excited about checking it out .
service is bad .
avoid their restrooms .
the server was kind of rude and dismissive in general .
when the food came , i must say that it looked delicious .
but it turned out to be a bad decision for multiple reasons .
first , the food was nowhere close to authentic indian food .
none of the food items were flavorful for what they were .
samosa chat was dry and soft , the crunch was completely missing .
to top it all , the servers were rude and paid little attention .
in short , i was highly disappointed .
i am never coming back again .
indian lady at counter ...
lady like her will only have negative rating for business .
do n't know how to deal with customers .
and for the record , my wife is indian .
the staff was nice , but incredibly slow .
then the original waiter came over and apologized for forgetting about my order .
so i was left waiting for a table .
i refused .
overall the experience left me disappointed .
the good was ok , but not delicious .
do not waste your money here !
there was no salt , spices , flavor , or color in anything .
i have had buffets here , and they are useless .
are you kidding me ?
no acknowledgement , nothing .
i am never going back to this restaurant .
ca n't even bite into that thing .
will not go here .
dead and alive !
not a customer friendly restaurant .
limited quantity .
had to wait _num_ mins for bill .
worst customer service .
when we reached there , the lady was rude and said they 're closed .
no courtesy to be polite .
zero customer service , now imagine the food one would get !
the only difference was that we are not indian and everyone else was .
the host was rude and not at all apologetic .
the dish was okay , but not very flavorful .
no thanks .
we had a bad experience with this visit .
that was so rude .
this is the worst pizza hut location ever .
this place is horrible !
not sure what his attitude and deal was maybe he hates his job ?
the pizza sucked anyways waste of time .
and the management is horrible at this place .
do n't waste time or money .
pizza was more than _num_ mins past the _num_ hour promised delivery time .
but it will def be my last .
sucks the service is so terrible as i like pizza hut pizza better .
it took them over a month to replace my hard drive on my laptop .
worst experience ever !
Very negative
i wish i could give this a negative star .
the worst experience ever .
ridiculous .
do not shop here unless you enjoy wasting you time and money .
cheap furniture and poor quality !
my bed lasted _num_ years .
i will travel to hickory furniture outlets to get better quality furniture next time !
beyond pissed at this purchase !
i guess that is why the food took forever to come out .
no more sirloin cooked in jim bean sauce ... .
i 'm not kidding !
nine bucks for a burger and will only serve them well done ?
i settled for a bowl of watered down and completely bland chili .
my wife and i stopped in here last night .
i ordered the jumbo soft pretzels and the bacon ranch steak quesadillas .
the restaurant is pretty empty .
i thinly my waitress 's name is angie .
the quesadillas were flavorless and filled with fatty meat .
ugh .
unfortunately with a tip included the bill was $ _num_ .
that 's way too much for mediocre food .
my boyfriend got there first and requested a table for _num_ .
it takes another _num_ minutes for us to get our beverages !
the service was just unacceptable .
he gave us a free cheese dip to try and calm the waters .
our food still took another _num_ minutes to get to the table .
needless to say i was very upset .
i took one bite and sent it back .
the manager apologized and did not charge us for the plate .
not sure what was going on this night but the service was absolutely horrible .
i have eaten here before but never experience such unpleasant service .
usually chili 's restaurants are pretty consistent but this one is lacking .
the chicken fajitas , usually very predictable , were totally bland .
and no squeezed lime either .
slow service , never brought my appetizer but tried to charge me for it .
worst service i 've had in the area .
the bartender gave good service but the food runner was not friendly at all .
as for the food , it was not up to par .
the beef tacos did not have seasoning .
their beer cooler was also broken and they had only two beers on draft .
unless i get another gift card here i wo n't go back .
the worst food and the worst service all in one .
it took over _num_ minutes just to get water .
the manager brought out our main course and they were wrong .
to top it all off the food was terribly undercooked .
this was the absolute worst restaurant experience i have ever had .
awful , even the manager does not have customer service skills .
i ca n't tell you how bad this location is .
i could keep typing , but i wont , for now .
the worst experience i 've had at any restaurant !
this is not what we received on our plates .
when the fajitas came out sizzling , my mouth watered .
i pulled one off my plate and it was cold .
my fianc 's steak was fully cooked and tasted like cardboard .
however the food was pretty disgusting .
the worst part is that they put a garlic butter sauce on the tacos .
there 's too many restaurants in this area that are better than this chilis .
the food is mediocre & the place looks dirty .
the glass next to our booth was covered in greasy hand prints .
maybe that 's why the parking lot was empty ... .
slow service .
cold food .
this is the worst chilis i 've ever been to .
at yesterday 's visit our queso was so thick it broke the chips .
was sat at the worst table you could be seated at in a restaurant .
it was very loud and the food was not too great .
i 'll be calling wells fargo .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
the fees stood .
let me take care of that '' and refunded me the fees .
horrible , liars !
ive been a bank of america customer for over _num_ years .
i have _num_ accounts with them each having _num_ figures in each one .
so friday , i came for a repair .
so ultimately i had to pay for their mistake .
i do not recommend .
this was my second visit to v nails .
when i first move to charlotte _num_ years ago this apartment complex was great .
the leading company did nothing .
not worth it .
take your money elsewhere .
huge turnover in office and they never care or follow up with anything .
horrible breakfast .
horrible shower ( no pressure or hot water ) .
the downside of this hotel is it is very loud .
the soda fountain machine is not up to code .
just nasty !
the employees count out peppers and skip on product to save money .
food tasted ok .
staff is unfriendly and constantly playing inappropriate music .
i can not speak to the quality of the course or clubhouse .
typical chinese restaurant .
the food was awful .
the beef was n't edible being that i could n't chew it .
i hate giving bad reviews , but this place was horrible .
i would n't recommend it to anyone .
do not stop here .
my boyfriend and i came through the drive thru at around _num_ pm .
i was confused at why they did n't tell us that when we ordered !
i then just said that i would just like a refund for the salad .
terrible !
terrible .
sorry not sorry !
i 'm not sure where to start .
- she but my english muffins thrown in with other items that crushed them .
the employees did n't even offer to help get him his stuff back .
service is awful .
manager is terrible .
store is older and needs to be remodeled .
this store needs remodeling badly .
the store manager apparently does n't care .
that 's an old supermarket trick from ages ago .
do n't stand for it !
it will be too late to correct .
hey , even food lion is _num_ times cleaner than this store .
bad eats !
not a fan of this harris teeter , very bad produce .
every time i have to go here after work i instantly regret it .
i wok long _num_ hours days .
sometimes i ca n't make it to davis lake location in time .
this is the worst harris teeter around .
this place is terrible !
- be prepared to find no napkins and dirty tables .
this is one of the worst wendy 's i 've ever encountered .
and sadly it 's the one closest to my house .
unacceptable .
ugh .
this is the absolute worst wendy 's in the entire country .
i can not believe the owner would allow this place to be this gross .
my meal had all the correct ingredients , but the wrong proportions .
the chicken was dry and way too much condiments on my food .
i like wendy 's but this one is no good .
the interior is sad and the chicken sandwiches were no good .
clearly , the worst wendy 's i have been to .
last _num_ times i 've came here they have gotten my order right twice .
best word to describe this place is garbage .
worst service i have ever experienced in my life !
its a rip off .
i will take my business elsewhere and suggest you do the same .
omg maybe the left the honey bbq wings out too long ?
worst pizza hut .
worst staff and service ... freaking horrible !
super slow , super lazy and super inefficient staff .
it was a very bad experience for us .
the wait time was crazy .
plus there was at least _num_ cars behind me waiting for their orders .
my slowest experience at pizza hut ever .
next time i may be going to the dominos less than _num_ min .
only positive is they have a drive thru .
probably the worst pizza hut ever !
pizza was not cut properly either .
i wish i could rate this pizza hut less than one star .
worst customer experience ever !
terrible customer service !
if i could give zero stars i would .
this is the worst pizza hut ever !
a two hour delivery wait for one pizza and an order of wings !
not even super bowl sunday !
i always choose pizza hut over dominos until i ordered from this one .
this is the worst !
i understand that it was going to take longer than normal , ok .
we were very excited to try the new flavors with the pizza .
not to mention , never was there an apology for the inconvenience .
the convince of delivery just is n't worth it here !
terrible customer service !
pizza hut you should be ashamed !
Negative
if i could give it negative stars i would .
what a waste of time that was .
i will never ever go to this pizza hut again .
save yourself the headache and go elsewhere , trust me .
so we ordered a white cheese pizza with spinach and was completely disappointed .
i will not recommend ordering a spinach pizza from here .
just avoid going here .
unfortunately , customer service is not tops here .
this particular location along every other restaurant on this block has the same problem .
employees act like they do n't want to be there .
this location is very busy .
tried pizza hut again today .
another few minutes passed before anyone came to the front or even acknowledged me .
well i was very disappointed with the service here today .
if you offer call ahead that makes no sense .
we all know that it would n't be ready by _num_ .
get your shit together management .
i did n't want to call at this point i just want my pizza .
i 'm told the price and it will be _num_ hr .
but i have to wait _num_ min .
note to self never run out of frozen pizzas again .
zero stars .
not cool !
my burritos were not even hot .
they tasted like they had been sitting out at room temperature .
slow drive thru line and the girl running the window seemed so unhappy .
the worst waffle house i 've ever been to .
there was a piece of hair in my food which really grossed me out .
it was so gross the amount of syrup in the drink .
it was mostly vanilla with a little bit of coke flavor .
it was dirty and gross .
there was a short wait but nothing too crazy .
my boyfriend picked up his menu and ants started crawling out from under it .
we immediately got up and walked out .
we were disgusted and could n't shake the feeling of things crawling on us .
this particular visit was nothing close to that .
needless to say we arrived empty and left empty .
do n't even want to see the exterior of this place .
not one bit about this experience has gone right .
i do n't stray from my favorites .
i went through the drive-thru and the lady had a difficult time hearing me .
so by this time , i am livid .
as a customer , i just wanted to ensure that she heard me correctly .
i have never done this but i was mad .
maybe i just expect too much .
wanted to see how long it would take ... _num_ minutes ... .
not again .
service is virtually non-existent .
the atm machine looks like it would steal your pin number .
for all that is wrong what you get in return is low prices .
yes , the bathrooms here are gross .
the place smells and the restrooms were in awful condition .
terrible service !
# shame on the gm of hilton !
certainly not the best hilton property i 've ever visited .
the problems started at check-in when my room was n't ready .
needless to say , i accepted .
the next day there was a storm and part of the hotel lost power .
i tried the control on the side ; it did nothing .
this is a beat up hilton garden inn .
bad layout etc .
this needs to be a something other than a hilton garden inn .
but will never stay here again at this location period !
the only thing they did was put clean towels in the bathroom .
she notified me that she would be in our room in _num_ minutes .
i had to wash my little ones with my hands and soap .
so slow will never stop here again .
oh my god soo slow !
( they said no problem ) .
the wifi is horrible !
i stayed here one night june _num_ , _num_ while visiting family nearby .
the two times i made telephone orders both girls had major attitude problems .
if you do n't like your job , then quit .
horrible experience .
the worst hotel i have ever stayed in .
i booked through expedia and the hotel was closed after 11pm with no notice .
i could n't check in and had to sleep in my car .
i would not recommend this establishment .
worst management staff ever !
no big deal - it 's not expensive .
of course , we freak out thinking something went wrong .
this place is the worst and we will move as soon as possible .
do not eat here .
it is awful !
really bad .
you could n't pay me to eat here again .
warning to vegetarians : the spring rolls have shrimp in them .
warning to everyone else : the spring rolls are bland bland bland .
jade garden wo n't deliver to me so this is really out of convenience .
i will not be traveling across town anymore .
the food was not very hot because it was served on cold plates .
the pancakes did not taste like they were homemade .
the service was ok but could have been better .
one woman was hostess , server and cashier for the entire place .
the speed of service and quality of the food were n't an issue .
no professionalism .
i do n't blame the server as much as i blame poor management .
she was not very friendly but everyone has an off day .
all in all , would not recommend to anyone .
never going back .
if you are in a rush , i would n't recommend going here .
this was my first trip to this restaurant .
but the four cheese grilled cheese on brioche toast was not good .
it was bland .
and worst of all there was no mayo !
service was extremely slow .
server never came back until we had been done eating _num_ minutes .
toilet areas were dirty with tissue everywhere .
do not waste your time eating here !
except if it 's _num_ minutes before closing time on a monday night .
the only positive experience was the apologetic and friendly waitress .
i only like this place because i grew up with it in ohio .
they are sooo slow .
it 's extremely annoying and very disappointing .
waited approximately _num_ to _num_ mins to get seated .
this place is a joke .
the interior vacuum job was mediocre at best .
no concern or response after a $ _num_ wash and $ _num_ tip .
_num_ stars for poor customer service .
lens has nothing to do with it .
worst car wash ever !
their complete and utter disregard for ethical business practices is shocking .
watch your back because they wo n't .
ps .
they only refund if they cant approve you .
i would never trust this business with a penny of my money .
slow !
i am easily impressed by mediocre chinese food .
this place is n't horrible but its not good either .
its close , its cheap , and i like `` chinese '' food .
only stayed due to time for my lunch .
i thought she was sick or was just bought back from the dead .
her attitude was nasty , like i was doing her a favor by ordering .
the restaurant itself did n't seem particularly clean so i suppose it makes sense .
this is the worst place to take your clothes !
not worth the risk .
worst service ever !
bad choice !
they will never keep customers at this place .
i also asked for _num_ minor stains to be removed .
horrible service .
i 'm sure they will be out of business soon anyway .
do not waste your time playing this course .
spend your money elsewhere !
horrid conditions .
poorly maintained and i hear they are in serious financial trouble .
however , from what i can see they go downhill fast .
we played _num_ holes today and was my first and probably last visit .
( photo below ) .
this course is awful .
this course has a great layout , however it is in very poor condition .
the greens were atrocious .
i 've never seen such poor greens .
do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this place as possible .
the new management is not `` dog friendly '' like the previous owner .
i would steer clear of this apartment complex .
)
but still , i did n't see anyone wash their hands .
maybe it 's time for me to stop eating out .
stayed in line _num_ minutes from the time i ordered .
$ _num_ for a large .
got to the window stayed an additional _num_ minutes .
no big deal .
it 's just strawberry right ?
wasted my time and made a profit !
no confirmation screen no total no please pull forward .
she never came back so i just took off .
it 's not that difficult to take an order now .
no ... .
their card machine is almost always `` broken '' so they only accept cash .
they ca n't make a cup of coffee to save their lives .
_num_ strikes on one ice coffee .
they gave it to me with cream and sugar .
this place continues to go downhill .
i like mcdonald 's but avoid this particular one like the plague .
i have called at least three times and complained and nothing has changed .
zero stars out of everything i ordered at _num_ on a friday .
this has to be the worst mcdonalds ever .
the staff is extremely rude and slow .
i wait _num_ min for my food .
this is quite possibly the worst establishment on earth .
every time i 've ever been here i 've had something to wrong .
it 's always down does n't matter what time you come here after 8pm .
2am after the bar , it 's being cleaned .
will not be eating here again , even though the food is great .
crap , not coming again .
my last visit to jason 's deli was disappointing .
first , this place is totally overpriced for what it is .
the salad bar is $ _num_ and to add a protein is $ _num_ .
you can get a salad at any other restaurant for less than this .
they were not doing a good job of keeping it stocked .
gross .
i 'm assuming that they chop it up in store .
i do n't understand why they would n't remove those pieces .
there is also a selection of pre-made pasta salad , potato salad , etc .
i was really disappointed with this last trip .
it just seems overpriced and that the quality is n't all that great .
i get to the location , pay for my order and wait .
_num_ minutes , _num_ minutes went by .
there 's no way that the order did n't exist in the system .
i was simply forgotten about after i paid for my order .
i placed the order _num_ hours early online .
ate here yesterday and came down with a bad case of food poisoning .
the chicken in the soup did n't taste quite right .
they seem to always forget my salad dressing whenever i get takeout .
i have to remember to check the bag and it 's really annoying .
i had the worst experience ever .
nice way to run a `` fast food '' joint .
do not purchase from this location if you want quality food .
it 's sad because their menu has many options and it actually sounds appetizing .
the night staff does n't seem to care at all it seems like .
very unnecessary when you are just trying to pickup food .
i would much rather use the harris teeter right down the road .
employees are n't very friendly or helpful .
you got it folks , that 's $ _num_ cents for one stamp !
plus they do n't tell you so be sure to check prices .
it 's not like he told me or warned me .
just dont go here .
trust me , just another notch from your local places .
despite the high reviews , i found almost nothing special here .
the pizza slices tasted like cardboard .
no flavor and dry and hard .
i would not waste calories on this in the future .
the garlic knots , however , were actually good .
even though it 's super convenient , i will not return .
there are better pizza places i 'm this area .
for starters , their website is terrible !
the spinach ricotta was terrible .
the slices were underwhelming .
the sauce is bland and the cheese tastes like it 's stale or something .
they really should have more chicken on there .
she also told me to report the women 's room was disgusting .
what a major disappointment !
thought it could not get worse then the pizza came !
basically told us to go by 8:30 cause tonight they 're closing early .
they were just going to spray the room since they were sold out .
slept at the airport terminal instead .
the coffee - also not very good .
time to upgrade , marriott .
my co-worker and i agree that we wo n't be staying here again .
this location is beyond frustrating .
extremely frustrating .
long wait wrong order .
not a place i can recommend .
i think they had a new person on the phones tonight !
totally wrong !
called and complained , new pizza sent , wrong again !
i even called back to confirm , `` thin and extra crispy ! ''
new pizza was thick crust and not crispy !
but i could eat it , no olives !
tipped the driver $ _num_ both times , not his fault !
$ _num_ plus two $ _num_ tips for one pizza and a small brownie ?
i also asked for a bath on wednesday .
still , i try to keep my expectations reasonable and was not overly concerned .
i looked more closely and saw that his eye was very , very red .
lots of promises , payments made , and no results .
what a mistake to go through lowes .
i 'm not getting floors installed in my bathroom .
i do n't need my sink disconnected .
this has been an absolute mess and i wish i had never done it .
i have no faith that the floors will be installed correctly or efficiently .
only been here twice , both times through the drive-through .
i did n't complain , mistakes happen .
rudely answer : `` no , we are n't serving breakfast . ''
but then to be rude and unapologetic , that is just unnecessary .
not some zombie staffed fast food chain .
get over yourself and quit being rude .
_num_ ) food delivery to table : _num_ minutes .
i 'm sorry to say this was an absolutely terrible experience .
the first ever bad chick-fil-a i have ever been to .
very unorganized staff .
i will not be back .
ok this is a confusing review for me to write .
wing king would probably be way more successful with an entirely new wait staff .
this place does n't even deserve _num_ star .
we realized that she had forgotten to put in the order !
very disappointed this time .
probably wo n't be back for a long time .
accidentally posted this review on the wrong restaurant .
regardless , i corrected my rating to reflect wing king .
get some manners and learn how to serve all of your customers .
beware of this charge .
no thanks .
this is a deep fry food place _num_ % , not at all original .
when i arrived , the place was in tip top shape !
i mean , everything was clean , in order , etc .
the overpriced sushi had bad avocado and served to customers .
man i wish i would have these reviews prior to ordering .
the worst sushi ever !
customer service is horrible .
unless you owe money , nobody even speaks to you .
guess i should quit my job and just train .
ridiculous .
walked in .
no customers .
we began to leave and he did n't even acknowledge that we were leaving .
stay far away from this place !
terrible service .
ca n't say anything positive about this location .
wo n't be returning .
i ordered the breakfast special , a typical eggs , meat , bread combo .
the eggs were okay ( hard to screw up scrambled eggs ) .
the sausage was dry and lacked flavor .
the huge serving of hash browns was bland , and the biscuit was so-so .
the food was lackluster .
the beef tips over rice had no sauce so it was dry .
you could taste more egg than cheese in the macaroni and cheese .
poor customer service .
the food was n't that good .
very bland .
terrible place to stay at .
do n't recommend this hotel at this location to anyone .
the hotel was n't horrible only because of her .
there was n't a clock in our room .
their room 's light was very dim .
their toilet did n't want to flush .
in both rooms , the pull out sofa mattresses were n't very comfortable .
our youngest son put the mattress on the floor so he could sleep .
let 's just say he did n't sleep well .
it 's a crazy place to have a smoking area is you ask me .
bagels , mini muffins , yogurt , and dried cereal .
it 's not the best breakfast but it 's not the worst .
this is the worst hotel experience that i have ever encountered .
they claimed my priceline reservation was for a single handicap room .
needless to say .
i stayed on a one bed handicap room with two kids for _num_ days .
and if that was n't bad enough the place had a major bug issue .
they refused to put us in another room .
i could go on an and on about this horrible place .
not even to an enemy !
i do n't know why i keep giving wal-mart my business .
as usual , the items i wanted were out of stock .
after a few tries , i gave up and left them behind .
at least the greeter wished me a `` blessed day '' as i left .
sorry , wal-mart .
waiting for registers is always hit or miss .
but i usually have to dig through the stack because a bag is ripped .
waste .
ugh .
i live my life on fruits .
stupid people do n't care for someone 's time .
i hate it.
very poor customer service very poor indeed .
poor customer service !
my experience at walmart is always bad .
wrong !
terrible customer service .
do n't go here for an oil change .
worst walmart ever !
and i want to wash my shoes before getting back in the car .
the only saving grace is the self checkout .
the fruit and veggie section is n't the best .
the meat section isnt that much better .
should n't that have been done the night before ?
our girls stayed here two nights for a volleyball tournament .
this hotel obviously attracts clientele of very poor moral character .
i received old , cold and bad tasting fries .
the bun was as hard as a rock .
what a waste of my money .
i did not get a response to my complaint .
avoid this location at all costs .
my suggestion would be to skip this place after dark .
next day with my other car they said nothing below $ _num_ .
i 've had issues with this particular auto bell recently , though .
nope - had n't even been touched .
much friendlier staff there , too , in my opinion .
paid $ _num_ for the full monty but got a $ _num_ job .
vacuuming was barely done .
the worst service ever !
i would not recommend this place !
$ _num_ down the drain !
my interior is n't even wiped down .
this is just disrespectful !
this the second time i have spent $ _num_ and got nothing for it .
i stopped going about _num_ months ago since the service has gotten worse .
i went today and now i remember why i quit going .
i do n't understand why they do n't ?
very annoying !
i will never go back to this location and i do not recommend them .
when another attendant gave me my car back the poop was still there .
i have a black car it 's not hard to notice it .
second thing all of my personal belongings were thrown on the ground !
overpriced car wash !
very bad service .
do not wash your car here .
wrong !
probably the worst customer service i 've experienced at any establishment .
these people are the definition of `` bad car salesmen '' .
the blonde sales manager is a complete nightmare .
rude , rude , rude .
both times we went there we stayed up to _num_ hrs .
i reached out to the rep .
lastly , i want to address the two clowns on the larry jay commercial .
thumbs down to this car lot !
why , oh why do i keep going to steak and shake ?
it takes a long time to get someone to acknowledge that you are there .
not overdone like so many other places .
also , you have to get a milkshake .
the worst !
nope , not a fan .
i 'm a french fry lover so this was very disappointing .
the only saving grace and reason for the _num_ stars was the milkshake .
other than that i do n't see myself running back here anytime soon .
i was so disappointed because i am a huge burger fan .
fast forward _num_ minutes when my burger arrived .
i refused , paid my tab , and left , never to return .
i been waiting in there drive threw now for _num_ min .
i order a shake i 'm sure it 's nasty by now .
the customer service starting at try front register is horrible .
its was ok , nothing special .
i felt bad for the wait staff because the kitchen was a hot mess .
according to the manager he had all new staff and they were not efficient .
i 'm a patient person , but i will not be going back .
do not go later at night .
waited _num_ mins and food was cold and wrong .
i love steak n ' shake , but this location is awful !
_num_ minutes in the drive thru line ?
are you freaking kidding me ?
awful food on top of it .
so disappointed and the staff have no desire to move any faster .
i mean , i expect a wait - not a ridiculous wait !
the kitchen area was a complete disaster as well .
if i could give a _num_ star , i would .
do not , do not buy a mattress here .
ca n't wait to get the new mattress tomorrow !
too pricey for low quality wear !
i really do n't understand bad customer service .
i had a $ _num_ off $ _num_ coupon which i used there .
horrible !
they serve burned and inappropriate food that should be thrown out .
i will not be choosing this mcdonalds again !
it 's true , they do have incredibly slow service .
do n't stop by if you 're running late for work .
extremely slow service .
unacceptable .
a little slow on the drive through but my order was accurate .
not particularly smart in terms of profit or customer service .
should n't this be done before the store opens ?
call me different but i 'm not a fan of this location .
no matter what day or time that you shop !
horrible service !
manager bob to sales person oscar all our worst .
even the front desk lady is soooo rude .
poor customer service .
got home and six pieces were missing !
worst experience ever !
then he will try to charge full price on clearance items .
do n't waste your time and effort .
by the way , the delivering guys were rude and could barely speak english .
the worst company and customer service i 've ever seen !
last week , i purchased a dining room set .
i have never been so disrespected by a store manager in my life .
i am disgusted by this customer service .
unless you like to be spoken to like an animal .
horrible !
beware their so called warranty is useless !
i do n't have a day to just give them to wait .
terrible nail salon , do n't go there !
they were trying to save energy by only having one lamp on !
i will never return to this establishment for my manicure .
the service was very poor .
very unprofessional and rude .
this is a sad excuse for a baskin robbins / dunkin donuts .
unfortunately this is the closest location for ice cream to my house .
despite previous bad experiences , we gave it a try .
apparently lisa at baskin robbins can .
behold the slowest drive through you 've ever been stuck in .
please do n't scratch your head and then touch my food .
lady sitting inside did not care at all .
i 'm very unhappy .
saturday mornings are busy .
worst service i have ever experienced at a fast food place .
absolutely horrible , slow , and rude staff .
)
practically threw my receipt at me and said the spoons are down there .
ate my sundae at a dirty table , but they were all dirty .
basically anything pre made and fried like crab rangoons etc .
however , even this stuff is sub par .
the owner and attendants have worst attitude on the planet .
they do n't know meaning of `` customer comes first '' .
they sound bored and uninterested .
if they 're lost , they 're lost , you know ?
no , i do n't know .
my family is waiting an hour and _num_ minutes at this point .
at this point it does n't make sense for them to even show up .
did they lose my order and not tell me ?
he does n't know .
did you get lost ?
stopped in here for dinner a couple of weeks back .
same basic quality of food with a friendlier waitstaff and less sketchy clientele .
but tonight we had to go and pay close attention to everything .
nothing surprising there .
shitty beer selection but i already knew that .
we did n't browse a whole lot .
sirloin , which becky ordered with a baked potato and steamed broccoli .
for the appetizer we chose the corn guacamole .
they did n't taste horrible ... but you could n't dip them into anything .
i barely touched my fries , the marinara was pretty bland and disgusting .
the cole slaw was pretty standard but pretty bland as well .
they just suck .
once we walked in the door i remembered why .
after being seated we ordered the _num_ for $ _num_ .
the margarita chicken was bland and the black beans looked old .
the kicker was the wait staff .
when i complained about the food the waitress apologized and walked away .
will never go to another chili 's ever .
paper thin and always kept breaking .
worst .
late craving for the family on new year 's day .
the waitress was so loud , everyone knew what was happening in our table .
your performance also is taken into consideration .
so much for running in and grabbing a bite .
i was n't impressed at all with the food or the service .
i was annoyed !
very unfriendly and rude .
if it were n't for the location this place would be closed .
bad attitude !
customer service on the phone : lackluster .
poor for a chain !
not sure why the even did other than it being a holiday .
food was average chain , service and atmosphere suck .
table of _num_ and everybody had complaints about their food .
everybody was sitting with empty cups from beginning to end ... horrible experience .
this place clearly does not take pride in their cooking .
i tried the general tso 's tofu and it was just weird .
to me the sauce did not taste like general tso 's either .
i did however like the vegetable spring rolls , however they were pretty greasy .
clean inside , and nice bathrooms though .
ordered delivery ; was told _num_ minutes by person that took order .
poor service and mediocre food .
won ton soup waaaay too salty , chicken fried rice and crab wontons passable .
no return business from me .
was not that good should have just stop at my regular spot for chinese .
ribs were over cooked and hard .
probably will not return .
but yelp is n't having any of that .
so the last three meals from this place has been worse than the last .
hey owners , what ever he wants in pay , pay it !
i 'll get another stylist next time .
stay far away from this place !
both the technician and the nurse practitioner made me feel like quite the inconvenience .
i will never return , and can not recommend this facility to anyone .
again , do not waste your money .
he could n't even bother to get off the phone before speaking to me .
i had zero faith that they could fix the problem they had created .
do not patronize this location .
the car was running fine when i brought it in .
so , i did n't .
when i went to pick the car up that afternoon it would n't drive .
they kept the car , they did n't fix anything though .
avoid these guys , seriously .
i gave it a couple of chances , but always walked away disappointed .
the food is n't really the issue , but it 's nothing special either .
the service here is consistently atrocious .
wait staff was polite .
food on the other hand was mediocre and a bit on the greasy side .
it 's a very standard casual dining .
i had a turkey cheese burger which was okay .
here 's where i take off the third star .
why did i get charged $ _num_ for a soda water ?
too bad i did not just stay with the soup .
so the whole experience was not as well as we had hopped .
i think both are stupid .
potato skins are potato skins .
made a stop the following week for hh .
another margarita not as good as the one at the bar first time .
do n't eat here if you want a relaxing lunch .
felt very rushed .
horrible !
we waited _num_ minutes to get our drinks .
our waitress did n't show up until we had been seated for _num_ minutes .
no bread .
i would have to roll silverware on dirty tables in the back .
i could not take it anymore .
we ordered clam chowder , chopped salad and salmon .
then , she brings my clam chowder , cold , excuse me !
anyway , we finished the meal , but will not go back again !
dense and then over cooked .
thank god the baked potato was safe !
meh prices , meh food , meh service .
fried catfish : soggy and slimy under the breading .
i 've never seen catfish like this before .
gross .
just bad .
coworkers that normally clean their plate only finish part of it .
mother 's day dinner sucked !
forget the food - the tables and floor were gross .
breading was flavorless and no crunch .
i was disappointed .
the food was just `` okay '' and service was less than be desired .
i wanted to really like this place but just could n't .
horrible service .
did n't even want a replacement meal !
wo n't be seeing me as a customer again at this location .
very few people , restaurant way maybe 1/3 full of customers .
hostess just stood there , asked how many in the party .
staff were crawling all over the place , so it was not understaffed .
our party got tired of waiting and finally just left .
hostess could have cared less that we left .
sad service , will never go back .
the worst restaurant experience i 've had .
horrible customer service .
the owner sandy and her sister holly are so rude .
no class .
rude and disrespectful .
are n't nail salons supposed to be a relaxing environment ?
they are also limited in the services they offer .
no new techniques or nail designs .
you 're making me wait so you can chit chat about your workout routine ?
they have a double drive thru that there was apparently zero training for .
then they charged me for the wrong order .
and trust me this is a typical breakfast run here .
slow service is usual here .
but today was the worst .
will not go back again .
this place is a rip off .
will not be going back .
she was rude and so full of attitude when talking to me .
everyone else was waiting to select a frame or see the doctor .
they did this _num_ times .
yes , they have stuff that 's not pancakes .
service seems a little hit and miss .
you have to practically beg for warm syrup at this place .
we were seated quick and easy with no hassle .
food is fine , typical ihop .
the food on the other hand was n't so great .
i was not satisfied with this ihop .
the table was not clean .
the food was terrible .
will not go back .
will not eat at this ihop again .
do n't bother .
slow staff .
in the last _num_ months it has become aweful .
none of the employees speak english .
i actually ate the food against my better judgement because i was starving .
and i just noticed i sat in something in the booth .
bacon large is five ( _num_ ) strips not _num_ .
been ordering the same meal forever and i get challenged by a new waitress .
make the bacon large and add another waffle light .
oh yea ... the oj machine broken ugh means no oj .
the staff was not organized !
it was total chaos .
this located is always chaotic .
my wife and i visited john 's family restaurant for dinner tonight .
the steak was ok but had too much fat on it .
the pumpkin pie was a little salty but good .
overall , we will probably go back but will try other things .
i was not impressed with the food .
the mashed potatoes were grossly runny .
do not waste your money !
they are located in a questionable part of town .
we ate , checked out , and went on our way .
no such luck !
( still nothing here in my size _num_ i needed . )
i almost walked by the area b/c it was so small .
rock hill store does not do this !
surely , charlotte has more ladies of size like rock hill does .
kohl 's used to be a favorite place to shop .
but now they 've priced themselves out of my budget .
very poor customer service .
i purchased a product there and used a discount coupon .
of customer service also to no avail .
when you need assistance there 's no one available .
poor service where people do n't seem to enjoy their work .
good thing ... .
buy buy baby is at the same shopping area .
zero stars .
worst service ever .
pressed light for service waited _num_ minutes no one showed .
i went in today for it and nobody knew anything about it .
a guy came out , did n't say a word to us .
obviously nobody cared about customer service at all .
i never write reviews and stuff but this was just insane .
wo n't eat here ever again ... in life .
the buffet did n't have as many offerings as i previously remembered .
there was a roach crawling on the wall heading for our table .
he then said , `` well , he should be dead .
needless to say i was done .
so , not quite the deal it used to be .
the staff behind the food is all hispanic and do n't really speak english .
i do n't know ... go check it out .
i probably wo n't be going back to any of them any time soon .
Negative
there 's just to much here to review and it 's mostly negative .
do n't let the varieties fool you .
the food is absolutely bland , tasteless and poorly prepared .
do you remember what your college cafeteria 's buffet style food taste like ?
the lasagna is so hard it is like a brick .
the bathrooms needs extreme attention , it really smells bad in there .
neither of these occurred .
do not waste your time and money here !
disappointing food selection .
overall not a good dinning experience .
however the food was just okay .
there just was not a good selection .
it was _num_ pm on a sunday so the place was pretty crowded .
not a great value really .
i attached a pic , you decide .
this place has a c grade sanitation score of _num_ .
we walked in saw that and walked back out .
the food was not that good some of it was cold or over cooked .
i would not go back , also the place was a dump .
worst buffet in charlotte .
the pizza was dry .
place was n't clean .
he was right , the movie was fine .
)
i usually visit this theater on saturday mornings .
all tickets are $ _num_ and the theaters are never crowded .
plus you get to pump your own `` butter '' on your popcorn .
the theater was absolutely disgusting .
it looked like it had n't been cleaned all day .
the place was nearly as gross as when we walked in .
the manager confirmed there was an issue and was being worked .
do n't make your customers come looking for someone for answers .
each of them felt that it was n't their job .
when i returned i was told it was handled .
this property did n't deliver and neither did the staff .
a friend and i stopped by the hotel for a bite by the pool .
however , it was the most disappointing spa experience i have ever had .
the spa pool should be separate than the one guests of the hotel use .
that made no sense and took away from the relaxation .
annoying .
they should have been tuned into that type of thing beforehand .
the lunch was disgusting .
nothing was special about this place .
for the price i would have expected first class , professional service .
it was very chaotic , very crowded and felt like a generic chain .
i do n't recommend .
my wife had a quesadilla whose crust was burned .
he sprinkles the pico , corn and other sides .
if asked for more the amount goes down even more .
but only because it 's closer than chipotle .
giving lowe 's a _num_ star for pricing of their tile jobs .
however the service is terrible .
rude servers at the 10th hole snack shack and clubhouse .
the owner supposedly thinks a beverage cart is not classy .
i have ordered from lotus cafe at least _num_ times in the past year .
i ordered from ma ma wok instead .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
stop wasting your time .
there are no decent hot meals ; terrible taste and variety .
the bakery is no good either .
the standard is far below what it should be here .
scum bags .
rotten meat .
these two packs where to be our christmas dinner .
they where purchased last week on sale and went straight into the freezer .
i live not even _num_ min from here ... .
they are arrogant money hungry bitches .
i ca n't wait until my lease is up the beginning of the year .
_num_ .
after moving in in october our air conditioning broke after _num_ weeks .
living area is big closet and bedroom are small .
keep avoid of strangers there lot of theft .

i will never think this place is worth no more then $ _num_ .
but i was wrong .
the floor is paper thin .
they walk hard , back and forth constantly .
complained many times but it did n't stop .
just disappointing .
_num_ .
they have a _num_ months notice period rather than one month .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
overall , not the best apartment complex i have lived in .
the clerk stated , that i could not return the used carpet cleaning products .
when i originally purchased the items , i was told their products were safe .
little did they know how i was being treated .
three days later i had n't heard back , so i called back .
i have a hoover carpet cleaner that was making a horrible noise .
why did you wait a month and a half .
why did you assume it was the motor to begging with ?
and to repair everything they want $ _num_ .
ca n't believe what we put ourselves thru for our pets .
the owner here is just down right ugly .
plus they have like _num_ day shipping at standard shipping cost .
clearly this owner needs to learn how to treat customers .
both times , the owner and staff seemed disinterested in helping their customers .
owner does n't care about anything but profit .
much left to be desired in the customer service department .
some of us are sick coming in without having the employees treat you stupid .
i already have a prescription , so i walked in solely to find glasses .
no one acknowledged my exit either .
i would not recommend this practice .
wait times on the phone to schedule an appointment average more than _num_ minutes .
front office staff not the most professional .
this has to be one of the worst run practices in charlotte !
over a month period ( if not more ) my daughter was sick .
she ended up having a chest infection and a really bad double ear infection .
my poor daughter suffered for almost _num_ weeks !
it 's never as clean as you 'd do it .
but you 're not having to do it .
and frankly , it seems like the worst scratches tend to show up afterwards .
has to be one of the worst car wash experiences ever .
not really .
their pluses ?
for the price , i do n't think it 's worth it .
i 'd rather spend the time doing it myself .
usually i hand wash my cars .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the vacuum job was horrible and clearly rushed .
very poor service .
i wo n't be back .
let 's not take about the rest .
the worst sub i ever had !
i was sick for _num_ days !
slow service and was not busy .
$ _num_ for a _num_ inch turkey sub .
$ _num_ for _num_ inch .
they rip you off on tuesdays .
any sub is supposed to be $ _num_ but charge for bacon .
the cashier was the old man with earrings was extremely rude .
ordered the roast beef and provolone , as i have a hundred times .
long time lost customers at last .
subway lost us awhile ago too , look what 's happened to them .
oh i know , smoothie king does !
why add a natural sugar to something that already has natural sugar ... fruit ?
they have wheat grass shots too and offer all around much healthier options .
lost my business and i live right around the corner .
.
fail !
they did n't care .
taking my business elsewhere .
she did not need to charge it until the end of the 2nd day .
i went to the verizon store to get it exchanged for a new one .
and i was told the battery life sucked because i used facebook ?
the hours i 've wasted .
i ca n't stand this place !
the stromboli was probably over a foot long and it was gigantic .
this is not a good place for health conscious eaters .
the white pizza is my fave so far .
i live about _num_ miles away and its never a problem .
fail .
ended up just throwing them away .
do n't let the name change fool you .
they were _num_ minutes late .
so we were waiting _num_ hour and _num_ minutes for two salads .
this place has horrible customer service .
this an absolutely ridiculous excuse !
the service , on the other hand was very annoying .
unfortunately , this was not the right choice .
to which i asked him to go find out .
i handed him my salad and and no thanks .
- no place to put our meals .
i do n't add salt to anything - but i sure needed it here .
even the chimichurri was bland .
not a great experience - and ca n't say i 'll ever be back .
so embarrassed to have brought my in-laws there !
it was very obvious they were n't jumbo .
i wo n't return for a long time .
poor service , worse food .
it was also very hectic and noisy .
what a disappointed .
i want my money back !
i finally did today and it was a disappointment !
the food was okay , nothing spanish about it .
the sangria tasted like cheap wine .
our server seemed in a rush for us to finish and leave .
definately not coming back .
i had made a reservation for valentines day and they messed up our reservation .
our reservation was for 8:30 pm so we showed up at _num_ .
when we got there it was a complete and utter mess .
but it did n't matter because they could n't find my reservation .
i highly would recommend a man never go here .
visited this location a few weeks ago only to receive a completely wrong order .
i immediately sent an email and still have n't heard anything from them .
never going to another chick-fil-a !
apparently the owner is n't checking procedures .
half time it is n't done .
why is it a problem for me ?
i am loyal customer but i will leave soon if things do n't change .
ca n't believe they allowed it .
they had a deal of buy _num_ tires get _num_ free .
but would give me a buy _num_ get _num_ deal .
would n't go back ever .
the worst experience i have ever had .
i repeat , do not go here not matter what .
i waited _num_ hours for oil and battery change although i had an appointment .
lastly , they either forgot my oil cap or left it loose .
i went in for a _num_ oil change and they never changed he oil .
so a day later i went under the hood to check the oil .
i was embarrassed for the sales clerk .
not how you want to present yourself to the public .
i will not visit there again .
the staff at the new store are rude , rude , rude !
the woman in particular really has a problem dealing with the public .
they refused to do anything .
this place stinks !
only beef and chicken , i have no use for a beef gyro .
i am a big fan of greek food .
the gyros was a processed , almost spam like tasting gyros .
to start , the decor and food is very outdated and bland .
the worst part , however , is the service .
but the past few months the service has become a real problem .
too many teenagers , not enough adults .
very disappointing .
bad customer service will run me away .
too bad since we eat here about _num_ times a month .
busy place .
i had the gyro platter and dh had the gyro and pork kabob platter .
will not go again .
i was n't impress with the food either , very bland !
somehow it took me over _num_ minutes to get my food .
i am very disappointed .
the fries were cold and my gyro was not as i requested .
i requested a refund and was told no refunds .
i have ate here before but never will again .
i am beyond pissed .
the tzatziki sauce left much to be desired and i was just disappointed .
it 's not great .
poorly run and mediocre food .
one , would n't you tell me that up front ?
the place is so nasty and looks as if it 's never been cleaned .
this place is an absolute joke ... .
the one star represents the restaurant 's lack of effort on customer satisfaction .
the customer service is atrocious .
mistakes on orders are frequent and the food is at best mediocre .
never be afraid to go greek !
its a little pricey , but you have to think location .
the place was packed on sunday for lunch .
anyway , the grilled chicken came steaming hot and with barbeque sauce .
for starters , this is run of the mill chinese at best .
i would not recommend going here .
it 's not even fair .
ugh .
a very bad experience , and we did n't even get to eat there !
the restaurant was not even a quarter full !
unacceptable .
they did n't even own up to their mistake .
unfortunately , this was also a miss .
she said they had hot sauce instead .
run away .
there are far more quality chinese restaurants at much cheaper prices .
my salad was a bit smaller than hers .
wife ( vegetarian ) got the mixed vegetables with brown sauce .
her flavors were a little too subtle for her taste .
she never adds salt to her meals but needed to on this .
i would n't go out of my way to eat here again .
worst chinese food i have ever eaten .
going back to wan fu which has been great for _num_ years .
the variety of beer was pretty poor , too .
i would absolutely not recommend this vet to anyone .
horrible !
and the wrap was just plain nasty !
really disappointed with this location .
i 'm quite disappoint at my experience here today .
and i would like to add in how much i hate mustard .
needless to say they lost my business .
she then looked at me with a disgusted look .
as it was , i walked out of there after spending $ _num_ .
the store is nice though , clean and organized .
its a no from me .
what a shame !
it was n't even _num_ yet !
we just moved to the area and so far this target is very unimpressive .
overall the store is not the issue the horrible employees are .
it was just ok .
nothing to write home about .
i did n't return anything as i was starving so i just ate .
my dinner partners all said the same just ok .
had high hopes for this place but sadly was very disappointed .
the calamari was super dry and flavorless .
the garlic knots are ok , but again dry and very little flavor .
i felt like i completely wasted my money .
garlic bread was served and it was salty and the garlic flavoring was overpowering .
bland and the marinara dip was lacking in flavor , too .
it was lacking that fresh italian herb and spices flavor .
the chicken marsala was the only thing that tasted nice .
i was disappointed , to say the least .
dough is chewy and sauce tastes from a can .
garlic knots were okay but could be better .
i really ca n't seem to find a good pie in charlotte .
was served relatively fast but overall it was poor .
typical southern italian food .
my food was below average at best and so was my daughters .
i was n't looking for anything fancy just something half way decent .
did n't find it here .
i just had the chicken parm and it was terrible .
i had to actually spit out _num_ bites until i gave up on it .
the tomato sauce was overly tangy in a weird way .
the waitress made us feel very rushed .
the staff dresses inappropriate for a restaurant setting .
the food was marginal .
the chicken in my pasta was very dry .
i did not eat it .
my husbands lasagna was very mushy .
my caesar salad was not cold and the dressing was watery .
very disappointed and went here due to the rating .
there are better italian restaurants in town .
wo n't be back .
worst service in north america !
the place was empty except one table .
i will not be back .
placed a carry out order and was extremely disappointed when i got home .
my garlic knots and clams were burned .
i went there by recommendation and paid $ _num_ for a _num_ $ haircut .
the styling was terrible .
it was a straight _num_ minute haircut .
the hair was simply blow dried .
i could n't tell a difference if i did it .
the product knowledge of different hair products is very poor .
my hair did n't feel or looked better going out of this place .
i might would have felt better paying _num_ $ for it .
i walked out very disappointed .
you really ca n't do anything wrong .
this place is really disappointing and i will never return .
do not use this place !
i should had checked yelp before going there - other person had problems too .
do n't waste your time coming here .
, they would n't honor it .
the taco salad had way to many beans in it and it was overpriced .
the peach margarita was boring and had no real peach flavor .
the lunch menu looked cheaper and i might try this place again .
i will update the review if it is significantly better or worse .
took an additional _num_ minutes to get the right entree while everyone else ate .
i was thoroughly unimpressed , which made me a little sad .
there was a gentleman sitting at the bar and _num_ other tables were seated .
salsa - tomatoes , onions and cilantro .
tasted fresh , which was nice , but nothing special .
nothing particularly wrong with it , just fine .
)
it was downhill from there .
returned on a week night after we had a great experience several weeks back .
service was horrible .
the conversation went on between them in spanish so we just left .
the only decent part were the chips and salsa .
one fish , one chicken , and one beef .
my mom ordered the same thing except with crispy taco shells .
zero flavor !
it was horrible !
there was n't a hint of tequila in these drinks .
the gallon of salt in the wound = the bill !
omg , $ _num_ for two meals , and two drinks !
do not waste your time or money .
you will be disappointed to say the least .
i went out of my way to eat here but will never go back .
my husband , son & i went there for dinner .
this time was a bit different though .
the waitress was extremely friendly but very slow , even before the rush .
$ _num_ for a sandwich only .
it was not worth it .
their cheesecake is authentic ( flown in from nyc ? )
i make a better pastrami or reuben at home !
i am a new yorker and i am so disappointed !
doubt i 'll be back .
disappointing .
bread was too thin .
owners changed last year and it is now only fair .
just had a pastrami sandwich and it was very bland .
wo n't be going back .
stopped by for lunch today , walked out after twenty minutes of being ignored .
three tables waiting to order and two , including ours waiting for menus .
too bad , we wo n't be back .
someone ( not from nyc ) told me to go here .
checked them out online and was excited to try .
my gf and i split plates to try both .
i will never return to this restaurant again .
in hopes of finding a decent deli we tried this spot for lunch .
there was plenty of meat but it was n't very tender .
the potato pancakes were awful !
it was like a big lump of deep fried flour with no flavor .
i quickly put it down and pointed it out to my husband .
he noticed it too and told me to tell the server .
i was n't prepared for what happened next .
all i wanted was to pay our bill and leave .
as i said , never going back .
this place is so hit or miss its ridiculous .
just ordered matzo ball soup .
ran out of matzo balls so they only gave me _num_ instead of _num_ .
normally i would n't care , but for _num_ dollars a bowl that ridiculous .
the service is slow and inconsistent .
the product is n't worth the price .
sad that they use the new york in their name to draw people in .
i looked inside and realized they no longer make their own corn beef .
after your comments i will gladly be back .
the place remains as unappetizing as its lackluster food and service .
management is not customer oriented .
unfortunately , on my last _num_ visits there have been issues .
the most recent visit , however , was a bit more annoying .
weekends - worse .
zero stars !
i 'm calling corporate today to complain .
this makes me not want to give them anymore of my money .
not so much .
little dough covering the ( small amount ) of pork filling .
the dipping sauce had no flavor at all .
the shrimp fried rice looked pretty good with green peas and carrots thrown in .
they never stood a chance .
the food was very bland and the chow mein was like wallpaper paste .
worst food .
disappointing .
disappointed .
i 've eaten in and tried delivery .
i have never had a bad experience until today .
hey , he was friendly .
anyhow , my lunch portion of chicken and cashew nuts was laughable .
unfortunately , i wo n't risk this happening again .
rude service both on the phone and when i picked it up .
egg drop soup and the entrees were ok , but not great .
disappointed .
worst chinese i 've ever had .
yes there is more and it gets worse ... .
nasty ... etc .
there are not enough words in the world to describe how badly it tasted .
there are dozens of other chinese places in charlotte , order from them instead .
person taking phone order was rude .
terrible .
food was flavorless and we had multiple dishes that we ordered to try .
worse than chinese food at the mall .
would not recommend .
wo n't be eating there again .
the rice and breading on the entrees were each very heavy .
big disappointment .
rudely defensive .
well it 's just nasty food coloring .
i will not be coming back .
place sucks .
i 've never had a horrible tasting chinese food until i had their food .
bourbon chicken is so bland , chicken is so dry .
mongolian beef is not mongolian beef at all !
there 's no beef , just carrots and onion and it was sooo spicy .
it taste so bad .
also forgot to give us _num_ rice for _num_ entrees order .
horrible place .
take your money elsewhere .
huge mistake .
the sauces in both were n't even tasty and was just plain salty .
i was very disappointed in the food for the cost of it .
shrimp lo mien was the worst i 've ever had .
i would not recommend this place .
this adds to the list of worst chinese food in charlotte .
there is a serious lack of great chinese food here .
my wife could n't eat them .
problem is that it 's convenient .
it was n't terrible , but it definitely was not good .
i would not return and would not recommend this place .
chinese is supposed to be cheap , and tasty - this was neither .
it was bland .
it was kind of mushy .
it was the consistency of soy sauce , and was not good .
i normally eat 3-4 of these , but ate one and was done .
that bad .
the chicken dish was fine .
nothing special , but not bad .
i felt ripped off .
save your $ _num_ and go elsewhere .
big disappointment .
nasty since no other place does that .
she just was being defensive .
i will not be coming back .
prefer no attitude with my ice cream .
just went tonight and the same girl waited on my family .
while ice cream might be delicious , service was horrendous .
unfortunately , they changed their policy and now close at _num_ .
there was also a roach running around the front door as we walked up .
he had to have been the owner , if not he should be fired .
never once did i have an ok experience there .
i only wish after the first rude visit i chose a different establishment .
two of the women who sit at the front desk were disgusting people .
i absolutely almost walked out right then .
those women were the most awful people i have met in a long time !
i do n't need a rude , stuck up vet !
terrible first impression .
this place was totally unprofessional .
does n't care at all about your pet .
she only cares about your money .
horrible first impression .
i wish i could give this place _num_ stars .
i 'm looking for another vet and groomer .
did i mention this place smells like urine ?
when i went back ( _num_ days later ) the pants were wrong .
these folks are rude , dirty , and hard to work with .
same day service is a normal service for dry cleaners .
i was promised a suit and shirt cleaned and pressed by 5pm today .
you are wrong !
i do n't like your attitude !
needless to say , i wo n't be back .
no towels !
just a bland deviled egg .
fried oysters : a little too greasy and absolutely no seasoning in the batter .
just do n't look for authentic cajun flavor here .
seriously , some of the worst cajun food on the planet .
charlotte needs a real cajun restaurant .
so far all the available choices are underwhelming .
usual wait wait wait & wait .
she said she would not seat us until the other couple arrived .
the most ridiculous policy i have ever heard of .
honestly , the service was poor .
and something i ate there left me ill by the end of the evening .
sorry , this place does n't get it .
the catfish was greasy and the oysters were soggy .
trust me , way overpriced .
needless to say , i was disappointed .
but , i work hard for my money too .
really left us hanging .
however , the collard greens and mac n cheese were quite good .
waste our money .
first the house style chips came to the table burn .
the food was bad all around .
my wife is from new orleans so we know how the food should taste .
this place does n't rate a one star .
you been warned .
did not live up to my expectations .
waste of money and will not be returning .
it is what it is i guess .
then waited another _num_ minutes for my credit card back .
the fish was so cooked that it fell apart with all the bones .
maybe i caught them on a bad day .
not impressed .
would not recommend !
horrible !
i ordered the special skirt steak which was so overdone it was like rubber .
will not be returning !
the food was ok , but not spectacular .
the slaw was alright , but not very strongly seasoned or flavorful .
blackened should be very spicy , but it was n't at all .
collards were ok , nothing to brag about .
overall it was an ok meal , but i 've had a lot better .
the server quickly took it away and was very nice .
i ordered the blackened tuna , smothered cabbage , and cucumber salad .
all in all , i 'd rather spend that kind of money somewhere else .
i seriously waited for about _num_ minutes and was n't even acknowledged .
i responded that i would appreciated if he would tell them that .
after another _num_ minutes i was told the car was ready .
i also washed off the back window myself .
next you pull around to the vacuum and get out .
that was disappointing .
$ _num_ down the drain !
do n't recommend .
i should n't have to .
this place is not worth the money at all .
please do n't fall for this place .
they did a terrible job cleaning my car .
i 'm so upset i gave them my business .
so i guess your asking why only two stars ?
the food was awful .
the manager returned , and offered another , new salad .
that is how forgettable it was .
no seasoning , not even a hint of flavor from olive oil or butter .
i just was n't feeling it here .
the steak was ok , although the bleu cheese sauce was very nice .
the sides were uninspired .
not very tasty though .
i do n't know why it 's so packed .
disappointing beer selection .
the lemonade was awful .
but they gave us a really long skinny fork that was more like chopsticks .
the fried spinach was good but too salty .
it was too much .
sorry , but there are so many better restaurants at a much better price .
the accompanying mashed potatoes were also quite cold and lumpy .
this was our first visit to firebirds .
we had to wait at least _num_ minutes for our table , no problem .
when my plate arrived , they had served me a ny strip .
i did not complain , it looked good enough .
that made my steak cost $ _num_ , not worth the money .
the place was loud .
it is over priced .
wife and i ate here for lunch the other day and it was so-so .
it looks like it should be much better .
i had the ribs and they came out extremely charred .
the food was uninspired and bland .
this is off my list , way better options .
the food was lacking .
very disappointing .
cut off about _num_ % of it .
not fast -- but friendly .
my husband and i had visited before .
but not in a while , and probably never for lunch .
things went downhill from there .
the salad was positively coated in dressing .
the burgers themselves were literally dripping with grease .
try the firebirds on sharon road in southpark .
bad experience .
the strange : i got a cocktail that was flat .
btw , the drink in question was n't removed from my check .
tuna was dry and flavorless the lobster queso .
after almost _num_ min .
i am _num_ years believe me this .
the wood fired salmon was disgusting and not cooked as requested .
the spinach was beyond gross with something slimy poured over the top .
worst customer service ever .
tried politely talking to her and she ignored me too .
i was terribly upset and will never go to this salon ever again .
i wo n't go back .
i have been here twice .
the first time was very nice but today was very frustrating .
she said that was all i was scheduled for .
there was no other attempt to make it right .
not relaxing at all !
bottom line , there 's nothing they can do .
i was told i had to wait for it to wear off .
the bad : went back a week later for massage .
i said `` forget it '' and walked out .
nothing overly unique , it felt like a typical , higher end steakhouse .
the waiter brought out wine glasses for the table .
our table ordered the coconut shrimp and shrimp cocktail for appetizers .
coconut shrimp were fine , but nothing special .
i had the wedge salad that i was not impressed by at all .
any good steakhouse should have no issue getting this order right .
the cake was a little try , but not too bad .
i really was n't that impressed .
wine selection is rather lacking .
too many choices to pull me back .
all left angry and disgusted .
just ok .
mashed potatoes seem like baked potatoes that are mashed .
old and stuffy atmosphere that needs an update .
quantity of food given is large , but lacks quality .
i had never had bland oysters before .
the mashed potatoes were passable at best .
we ate here on july _num_ , _num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the long island iced tea was not made correctly .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the wait for the wine was over ten minutes .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the collards that we ordered were lukewarm .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the ribs we ordered were dry .
_num_ .
_num_ .
unfortunately , this restaurant used to be better .
the side of mashed potatoes was fine , but too much for one person .
the service was simply atrocious .
heck , any kind of service would have been nice .
not so .
# _num_ marinara sauce on the chicken parmesan was watery .
not a good experience , possibly not typical .
the filet mignon was literally the worst steak i have ever eaten .
this is not an exaggeration .
the side dish of potatoes was inedible .
i will not be going back .
one gets the impression of very weak management .
quantity was awesome but the actual onion batter tasteless .
this silk hat on a pig is one of them .
first and foremost , the food was mediocre and over-priced .
to top it all off we felt sick for _num_ hrs after eating .
extremely disappointed for a $ _num_ meal for _num_ .
never going back .
)
the fries were oily and the shrimp could have been cleaned better .
too bad .
there is almost never anyone there .
not a big fan of this place .
this place is the worst !
wish i could give the .
Negative
negative stars !
i 've warned you while i waste away in home depot .
my dad and i went to this location to buy a chest freezer today .
there 's only one person that can get a freezer down ?
unfortunately they did not have what we wanted .
we reluctantly went back to home depot and got even more crappy service .
ridiculous !
i think i found a couple of peach pieces - it was meh .
forget meeting with any privacy at all .
have had three bad experiences there i refuse to ever go back to starbucks .
the service alone brings the rating down to _num_ .
its neither elegant or authentic , its just another italian chain .
however it does n't wow you or anything .
bad service , pasta under cooked , and a health score of _num_ !
avoid the soups ( like _num_ oz . )
sad , but our family is looking for another convenient , quality dining tradition .
then had no idea how to serve it .
order the lobster ravioli and it tastes like fish sticks .
order the mushroom ravioli and it comes out like a plate of hot stew .
meal for two was $ _num_ with wine and apps .
very disappointing .
we were sat quickly as the restaurant was not busy .
it was my daughters graduation and we were all so disappointed .
customer service is a lost skill at this restaurant .
after visiting for the first time , i 'm not sure why .
the chicken was so tough i could n't cut it with a knife .
the place was not that crowded and they appeared short staffed .
would you not have thought they would have fixed it ?
forty minutes later still no food and they would n't even produce a manager !
i now understand why this place has such terrible reviews .
my boyfriend and i walked in and were seated almost immediately .
we sat for fifteen minutes and not one person came to our table .
we walked out , right past the manager , who said nothing .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
what 's wrong with quality check at this restaurant !
poor poor poor experience , do n't go !
_num_ % that is just horrible , and unacceptable .
made reservations for today for an a christmas lunch and was disgusted .
rating is _num_ % !
will not be going back again .
will not go back .
overall very disappointed .
hard to say which was worse the service or the food .
i noticed the difference in my account _num_ days later .
they did refund my $ _num_ .
the food was low quality .
the fried macaroni ball thing was too greasy and completely falls apart .
the pasta tasted like something i could make at home .
the lobster ravioli was lacking flavor , however , it was cooked well .
just to be clear , i love macaroni grill 's chicken parm .
same waitress ordered the same thing .
we finally got _num_ out of _num_ dinners delivered cold .
he said nothing so we walked .
the waitress never came over and apologized or tried to make it work .
walked in and no one was at the host station to seat me .
you could n't even cut it with a fork .
$ _num_ for cold food and a _num_ minute wait .
my wife and i ate here last thursday and had a very bad experience .
a horrible dining experience !
everything about our meal was completely inedible .
this location is n't worth your time or a dime .
the place was nearly empty on a friday night at 7:30 .
one mail was missing a side dish that had been ordered .
the booth seats we were in are far beyond their life , very uncomfortable .
oil on the plate will run to the edge bad .
it 's obvious it say and they reheated it .
my wife 's meal came _num_ minutes later , nothing like eating together .
not so anymore .
it also helps that staples is nowhere near our house .
really makes me not want to go out of my way again .
copy center and print center employees are not helpful nor friendly .
never once apologized or seemed to remotely care .
there were maybe _num_ customers besides me .
one gentleman in line said there were _num_ guys along the left wall .
i called in a prescription early to be picked up several days later .
unbelievable bad service !
that 's _num_ % of the time !
i did contact them and they refunded me the $ _num_ .
i wo n't be going back .
called upon discovery of this serious mistake .
great regular pizza but poor service and a dangerous error .
so i explained they did have them and call them a hoagie .
so i waited and when i got home the cheese was not even melted .
what was the _num_ minute wait for .
terrible pizza .
smells and tastes like dominos .
not worth the money .
the bread is the worst part .
i just do n't understand how the management handles it .
filthy restaurant and food was extremely salty .
nasty with a capital n. never going back .
horrible customer service !
props , though , to the staff , which is very attentive .
the salads my dad got were pretty good , considering .
i will avoid this place from now on for sure .
the response was `` wow , i 'm sorry .
will not return for a while .
sorry , everybody does n't love showmars ... .
the food was fine , but not worth trying again .
all in all it was not terrible , but it was at best ok .
same poor quality .
the wings though fried well and crispy had absolutely no taste .
not even any msg ... i 'd have rather eaten cardboard .
it 's all different , and not for the better .
very disappointing .
literally the worst .
no receptionist .
it took a month to get my check from my closing .
if i had zero stars i would give zero .
numbers were wrong and getting things corrected was like pulling teeth .
so now i have no house and i have nothing to show for it .
fast forward _num_ hours .
they have some new stuff and some estate stuff .
i will not be going back there .
i said but , its around _num_ dollars !
so i called duke energy and spoke with them about outdoor lighting .
no one !
the absolute worst power company in the us .
our power has been out for _num_ hours .
poor customer service .
all around terrible company .
everyone hates going but we have to go .
that stinks .
personally the dentist is ok i guess .
i went back with headaches as the crown was too high .
it seems like his treatment is all driven around the insurance and costs etc .
the shrimp were not cooked properly , and the crawfish was virtually missing .
worst of all , there was no flavor , it tasted so horribly bland .
so all we had during those hours waiting was weak bland coffee .
i hope i never have to give another _num_ star review again .
it just makes me feel dirty .
this was the worst .
service was horrible .
the shrimp and grits were gross .
the place was dead cause it was a monday at _num_ .
the rest of our party was equally not impressed with the food .
i do n't remember having exceptional service there either .
unfortunately its not one of the places in the neighborhood i recommend .
other than that , i wo n't be back .
sloppy .
again , bland and disappointing .
ugh .
well tonight proved 2nd time is not the charm .
the hush puppies were good , but not worth the _num_ bucks .
the potatoes and asparagus were also covered in grease .
i will not be back .
bad experience .
the bills came out ... wrong .
it was just ridiculous .
on top of that , the service left a lot to be desired .
1st tip : do not even bother with the fried oysters .
you will hate yourself for ordering that .
the oysters are so tiny , and it 's not worth the money .
the new interior has lost all its old charm .
wife had shrimp and grits and that was disappointing too .
maybe it was an off night but i can only judge my experience .
the side of cornbread was also forgettable .
came here for saturday brunch .
however , the food was mediocre at best .
breakfast wrap was mostly scrambled eggs , not a lot of flavor at all .
this was a good attempt but just missed the mark .
the waitress brought me shrimp and grits .
_num_ minutes for lunch and no food !
it 's dry and bland .
unfortunately i was not impressed .
the bbq shrimp were severely lacking in flavor .
the fried chicken with the jambalaya was overcooked .
service was a bit slow as we waited _num_ minutes to be greeted .
overall the meal was decent ... but unfortunately we wo n't be back .
what my girlfriend ordered was very good , mine was absolutely horrible .
this was _num_ pm .
waited _num_ minutes .
owners are very rude people .
it started out poorly .
at this point , the employee became very difficult .
very poor management of course .
rude staff .
maintenance of course in bad shape .
very rude and i would be ashamed to have him work for my company .
the absolute worst business i 've ever seen in my life !
not the case here ... they will run you off the course .
never play golf at this place .
i would n't stop there to take a dump .
do not give this course a chance !
so , the first impression was pretty bad .
their signage was damaged and missing letters .
all signs that the place is generally not maintained .
then comes the customer service which was seriously offensive it was so bad .
the hot dog was disgusting and the beer flat and warm .
oh my god , the golf carts ... .
shame on you if you patronize this club .
you 've been warned ... .
in terms of ambiance , it 's a very large and somewhat noisy place .
and the clam chowder was n't bad either .
all kids meals are fried except the pasta marinara .
no substitutions .
they have several options and you can pick _num_ , pick _num_ , etc .
the inside is extremely noisy and bland .
it looks like your sitting on the inside of a elementary school gym .
the staff is extremely unpleasant .
to sum it all up : quantity over quality .
i have been excited to check this place out for months .
unfortunately my excitement ended after the hush puppies .
i ordered the mahi mahi blackened , with a baked potato and salad .
so i asked them to bring out my baked potato .
the food is real bad .
not recommended unless you like big portions of fried fish mush .
the service was slow , and the quality of the food was poor .
went with a group of _num_ ( or so ) around christmas _num_ .
it was n't awful but i have had better .
i wo n't go again .
tasted like frozen french fries that were cooked way too fast .
the bill came and for three people it was $ _num_ including tip .
i will not be going back here anytime soon , if ever .
the scoop was only used to fill pitchers .
probably not to this location and certainly not to dine in .
i 'll stick with takeout or patronize the location on monroe rd .
the platters were just ok .
service was ok but it could have been better .
the noise level was horrible especially the table of _num_ near us .
they were so loud you could not talk over them .
overall , i would not return to this restaurant again .
too much was wrong with the food & service to spend $ _num_ again .
worst service i 've experienced in a very long time !
do you people not understand that the food here is terrible ?
it 's awful .
bad service i want be going back !
unfortunately this bad experience left an unprofessional air and aggravation .
her response was they open back at _num_ : pm .
we canceled orders and was hung up on , again .
do n't think we will frequent this business in the future .
words can not really describe the lunch buffet .
the parking lot is empty for reason ... enough said !
the buffet had no food .
_num_ pieces of fries .
it was pretty much empty .
just awful .
the lunch buffet was greasy and unappetizing .
the dining room and restaurant are run down and shabby .
that 's the only good thing that i can say about it .
not one employee was in the deli area or the meat area .
no one was around .
i would n't even shop there , let alone work there .
slowest fast food place i have ever been to .
the reason why they are n't getting _num_ stars is because of the service .
i understand manager 's get frustrated , but this manager was extremely rude .
it was hard to watch .
ten minutes later , she appeared with out hot dog .
she just did n't get it .
i guess we were asking far too much of her .
poor thing .
is it ok if we never come back here again ? ''
when they did n't , i tried to go in to order food .
yet when someone else approached the window they instantly took their order !
we do n't give a crap . ''
do n't bother with this place .
i was stuck ordering something i did n't even really want .
never enough staff .
i have emailed and complained several times and nothing is ever done .
food is fine , just do n't consider it fast food .
i 've watch grass grow faster than they make the food here .
but their response was even more unbelievable !
and then hung up on me .
i have never in my life been treated this poorly .
rude customer service .
however , not apologetic at all .
average oil change place .
i feel sorry for his staff .
no thanks .
other than that , not worth the trip .
feels like your lost in a third world country , nothing but garbage .
i was just sorely disappointed with this place .
skip this sketchy place .
however , i did find a man selling silverware sets outside .
so maybe this place is a hit or miss ?
some people must buy things here , but i walked away with nothing .
nothing like it used to be .
traffic in and out is horrible .
no one spoke english and it was all mostly the same stuff .
i was hoping to antiques and it seemed like everyone had the same stuff .
i must be crazy , but there was something wrong about this bojangles .
did my biscuit come out promptly ?
not once was i thanked for being a customer .
she handed over my food and ignored me even standing there .
they seem to be a little skimpy with the food too .
i only stop here because it 's on the way home .
much prefer jersey mike 's though .
pharmacy service not good .
done with this pharmacy .
gave them _num_ extra hours and at 5:30 it was still not ready .
this is the last time i get my prescriptions here .
i would recommend not coming to this cvs !
this is ridiculous .
it is not cheap by any means .
this was n't the case here .
the food is good but not worth the prices they are now charging .
the service was slow , the food was mediocre .
this was our first time trying this place .
( i am sorry !
the ingredients just were n't fresh or something .
sauce has no flavor , breadsticks literally were just bread .
just no good .
also , their food is not that good .
the food is pretty horrible and the owner is a dick .
no cheese , no salsa , not sauce , no sour cream !
this food is awful , overpriced , and just plain garbage .
avoid at all cost !
we stopped over the weekend for lunch .
as with other posts service was a little slow .
i hate giving bad reviews but this place was definitely not destination worthy .
my gf had the prime rib which was tender but bland .
so our food got cold really quickly .
not a fan .
greasy and flavorless .
i 'm sure they got thrown out .
no thanks .
the food is mediocre , and the prices used to be really good .
the pizzas were not that great though .
sadly , the pizzas came lukewarm and left much to be desired .
i could n't bring myself to try the fourth pizza .
the entire property is run down , kinda creepy and pretty yucky .
went for a kid 's birthday party , and was not impressed .
i may give it another try , but i agree that madison deserves better .
i 'd give it zero stars if i could .
this should have been listed on their website !
what a scam , _num_ hours of skating for $ _num_ for _num_ people .
guess they wo n't be back there again .
the shrimp in both of our dishes were slightly rubbery and tasteless .
the waitress was rude and seemed bothered by any requests !
do n't waste your money on this place !
maybe they do n't understand that they need customers to stay in business .
the portions were ok but the food was bland and overpriced .
oh such a disappointment .
i ended up with grilled salmon which was very salty .
oh it was horrible .
i was just pretty disappointed .
the only thing i liked here were the cheese sticks .
there was one small problem : the food .
the room was a mess .
in all , the room was clean and decorated by 5:30 .
service was good , but the food was really disappointing .
bread was sub-par and the olive oil was not served with the bread immediately .
very disappointing .
lasagna was really bad and the fettuccine was n't worth a second bite .
service was really mediocre .
ten minutes to get water and lemonade .
another ten minutes to order .
my entree was disappointing .
generic italian chain .
lasagna is meh , ravioli was probably frozen .
i would not come back here .
when we got the meals , the steaks were decent .
they said they were open _num_ to _num_ .
i had an awful experience here .
i will not be going back here .
however this location is horrible .
this one is bad !
i wasted almost $ _num_ on a cup of milk foam .
i did n't want the hazelnut , but there was no choice .
ok , would be nice if u explained why .
i can only assume soup is n't served until later .
her name was jessica , as i asked the cashier before i left .
my smoothie was finished mixing but needed to be poured into a cup .
worst panera ever !
there is no line when you walk in .
do n't get me started on the attitude of workers !
what bread store does n't have bread ?
when i asked what they had instead she stared at me and said nothing .
this place is horrible for cat boarding .
the cats are kept in an upstairs room above the grooming area .
i would never take our dogs there again .
i was house sitting for some friends of mine , including their two dogs .
on sundays , the drop off times are very tight .
the check-in process was very quick and painless .
speaking in a very angry tone .
i 'm sick of people coming in whenever they feel like it . ''
i felt very awkward and a bit insulted .
she 's the only reason i gave _num_ stars .
i walk the _num_ more feet to my car .
overpriced , horrible selection , and the quality was n't even very good .
i will not be going back .
we arrived at 6:30 put our names in because of a _num_ minute wait .
coconut shrimp had no flavor .
i gave this trip _num_ star cuz the waitress was efficient and engaging .
it smelled of stale smoke .
toilet did n't work .
sink did n't work .
i would not recommend a stay at their hotel to anyone .
there was construction materials all over the place and it was filthy .
no one returned my call .
you can be sure i 'll never stay here again .
she made no effort to help me find the plant i was looking for .
from there , the mirage took off .
they are flavored like curly fries , but with twice the seasoning .
the only thing i finished here was the soda .
extremely rude mexican staff !
i am very dissapointed .
poor staff .
prices at kfc are getting outrageous .
i have been to this kfc more than _num_ times .
some times they did not have things we ordered from the menu .
the worst ever are the restrooms .
if you need to `` go '' , `` go '' some place else .
i will never return to them as a vendor .
_num_ pm .
then i once wanted lettuce on my hamburger and they forgot .
i could n't wait to try the cheese curds .
they did n't have any flavor .
looking for the best cheese curds the the old fashion in madison .
gets a major `` skip it '' rating from me .
i was not at all impressed by the food or the dessert .
the custard was nothing out of the ordinary .
_num_ people in michael 's , no cars in drive-through .
hot food is of very low quality , and ridiculously expensive .
service prompt , impersonal .
none of these things concerned me though .
michael 's is not very good .
the burgers , while being billed as `` big '' , are hardly that .
the fries are weak and not very good .
overall i am extremely disappointed with the customer service provided by the team .
on move out day , the crew was late .
after arriving in ny , i called to check on the final price .
no such luck .
finally , i get a call from a driver .
did a decent job with the plumbing , but installer was sloppy .
when i told him that he said he would fix it for $ _num_ .
with all the advertising this store does , i expected pleasant staff members .
what i found were surly teenagers who barely spoke and never cracked a smile .
i will never return to that overpriced and smelly grocery store .
the automatic wash took my money and did n't start when i went in .
worst car wash ever !
do n't waste your money .
so then we tried the automatic car wash and it did n't do anything .
our car is still dirty and we wasted $ _num_ .
there 's no attendant and the number to call was n't working .
absolutely would not recommend .
after the lackluster greeting , we left both times to eat elsewhere .
the bar is not stocked with much .
but that would be the only reason id go there again .
our family has n't had a meal so disappointing in a long time .
all in all , our bill came to nearly $ _num_ with tip .
chili had no flavor , just meat in tomato broth with a few beans .
hamburger was cold .
fish was very bland and flavorless .
french fries were mushy .
the only thing good was the coffee .
will not be returning .
one of the worst recent dining experiences i have had .
not helpful .
she is clearly in the wrong job .
beer order too !
the mushroom burger i had was supposed to be on a hard roll .
this is not a hard roll .
a hard roll has a hard exterior , much like french bread .
and , a hard roll would have contained the grease from the hamburger .
also , do n't expect a real plate .
worst .
fries are extra , they were mediocre .
the friday night fish fry was not very flavorful .
the food lacked seasoning .
i had a very bad experience at this gas station .
worst carwash ever .
they should do the right thing and close it down to avoid the hassle .
i like my dentists to care when you are in horrible pain .
and does n't really seem like they care !
i had the turkey melt , which again was nothing great .
would not come back .
service and food both lacking .
all of our food was lukewarm .
my wife 's walleye was like cardboard .
they should be better prepared for a friday night to accommodate larger crowds .
we wo n't be going back there again .
the service here was awful .
my friend and i were immediately greeted and taken to a table .
our drink order was taken and then nothing .
this was also a sunday night and it was not busy .
they received their drinks , but no appetizers .
_num_ minutes for southwestern rolls .
the food is mediocre at best .
i gave _num_ stars because the friday fish fry was n't terrible .
not that i 'm recommending it , but it was adequate .
the pasta does not look , feel and taste like from an italian restaurant .
very disappointed especially when you are hungry .
the place is under construction so very limited seating .
was very cold inside .
very dark lighting as most fixtures were missing .
holes in ceiling and walls torn apart .
there was only one other couple in the place .
food was n't terrible but lacked flavor .
was just really weird !
that side of the restaurant needs repairs and lots of upgrades .
i ordered the shrimp fettuccine alfredo , which admittedly was bland .
looking at my date 's plate , i noticed that it _num_ . )
)
looked exactly like mine except with spaghetti .
there is really no imagination in the preparation of the dishes .
also , sometimes , you just someone to cook your spaghetti for you !
i ordered the lasagna , garlic bread and a glass of chianti .
the lasagna had a nice cheesy toasted top .
the garlic bread , however , was a different story .
it was so awful i could not eat another bite .
i looked for a server for ten minutes before one came .
avoid this place at all costs !
i really , really want to like this place .
server did n't seem to really know the menu .
she was polite , but a bit clueless .
bruschetta appetizer was nothing to be impressed by .
bone in ribeye absolutely not worth the $ _num_ price .
zero flavor whatsoever .
and then there was the hair in my baked potato ... .
and the prime rib night was awesome .
i 'm hoping that 's not the only good thing here .
it is absolute crap .
do not bother wasting your money on this food it is extremely disappointing .
i never finished half of the plate .
terrible .
im from nyc this place was definitely subpar .
but reading reviews , people are speaking better of the place .
the shrimp was mushy and old , the rice was not flavorful .
did n't care for this place during my last visit .
i ordered the beef fried rice and it did n't have any flavor .
yuck !
overall rating : f .
every time it is unfriendly , hostile or dank .
specifically , the outdoor seating can make brunch unbearable .
as for the food , it was a pretty standard brunch , nothing special .
lots of pastries and cakes , but nothing spectacular .
nothing special , just real chewy deep fried meat .
location is _num_ stars ... the food and drink _num_ star .
the food is not good and over priced , the mixed drinks are weak .
know what you are going to get .
wide assortment of items but quality lacking .
bacon and prime rib overcooked .
eggs benedict were decent .
have not had that bad of an experience in a restaurant ever .
needless to say we will never return .
although the brunch is quite extensive , it is rather pricey at $ _num_ .
what a lousy way to treat your customers and such stingy business practices !
wait times were long for both our drinks and food .
the food is currently pretty nasty and not fresh at all .
not worth it .
i wo n't be back .
great location , very dated , friendly slow staff , awful food !
you 've been warned !
i hate to have to leave this poor review , but i must .
or , from our particular waiter , `` geez , _num_ minutes later .
so very rude !
it was so obvious that they were way too overwhelmed .
this was without question the worst meal that i have had at a restaurant .
the service was also terrible .
do not eat here ... it was awful !
that was a really frustrating experience .
i 'm pretty sure our server was incompetent .
that makes me nuts because it 's rude .
that was weird .
i 'd suggest eating somewhere else but i wish it was better .
strangely , it comes with a little side cup of chocolate chip cookie dough .
i ca n't stand cilantro and was able to order the entree without it .
my husband had a massive cheeseburger , which he loved .
they leave some skin on and use a lot of salt .
ok , no problem .
me : `` no , it was someone in a blue shirt . ''
her reply , `` oh , sorry , i forgot . ''
surprisingly , it only took about _num_ minutes for a table to become available .
i just about lost my mind at this point !
i can not believe how disorganized this was .
everything else appeared to have been purchased frozen from sam 's club .
i have gone to this restaurant many times in my life .
was grossed out on sunday brunch .
i think the food is horribly average .
then he blamed me because i did not communicate my problem correctly .
i 've really never had worse food .
gross and weird !
i would rather have _num_ well done selections to chose from then this mess .
the coconut shrimp is large , but tasted a little undercooked .
they took almost _num_ minutes before our drink order was taken .
we had barely gotten our drinks when we were buzzed for our table .
is n't that the entire job description of the hostess ?
slow and horrible .
horrible food .
shrimp extremely overcooked .
side of vegetable was clearly a frozen vegetable mix .
clam chowder was watery and not as tasty .
not worth the $ _num_ .
would only go back for drinks to sit outside and listen to the band .
first , it is a generously set buffet .
however , half of the food looks inedible .
the ala carte area seemed like something you can not mess up .
bacon , sausage , turkey , mashed potatoes and eggs continental .
there were no scrambled eggs but this off casserole of egg .
it was weird and i have no idea what was in it .
there was no description .
the bacon was greasy and the sausages tasted old .
the turkey was all shaped the same .
it looked like they were processed pieces of meat .
the clam chowder looked old .
i did not even attempt .
the breakfast potatoes were old , cold and over seasoned .
there was not a single simple salad .
expensive food considering the poor quality .
i settled for their ( i believe ) orange popcorn shrimp as an app .
for my entree , i order the crispy chicken sandwich .
my sandwich was dry and nearly overcooked .
pathetic .
considering it cost $ _num_ , you better cook to impress .
this place is a total rip off .
the decor is awful !
the food was not good .
they were ) no seasoning on burger - simply no flavor .
small diced flavorless chicken .
simply disappointing .
the mushrooms tasted like they 're cooked in dirt .
i 've given this place way too many chances .
my food has been meh to terrible .
the best part is the cookie dough and the ambiance .
i am only going back for drinks and music in the future .
the food has failed me too many times !
within a course of _num_ or so months , we returned _num_ times .
i 've been coming here for 20+ yrs and its hit rock bottom .
it is that bad .
the chairs are a little uncomfortable .
it had some heat to it but lacked any real flavor .
the first time it was yellow , second was red , third was pink .
very weird .
my husband and i wish the establishment well but we will not be back .
fool me once , shame on you .
fool me twice , shame on me .
how does a place mess up fried cod and fries ?
the fries were lip greasy and mushy .
the fish was white mashed potato like fish with a soggy inedible breading .
the bloody was bloody awful !
i 'm not sure what was in this thing but it was sour .
horrible .
worst .
i 'm not going to do my business with them anymore .
traditional supper club , outdated decor .
the fish was definately frozen and overcooked , chewy and lacking flavor .
we also ordered cheese curds .
one of the worst times we had is when we went and ordered steak .
the service was very slow .
we were so sick of sitting there we got boxes and left .
i was too mad to eat .
my husband ate some and said it tasted old and a little off .
such a waste of money .
the lack of quality in food is the reason i was disappointed .
the coleslaw furthermore was bland , and the rolls did not seem fresh .
i wo n't go back .
really good service too , just wish that the food was better .
unfortunately , our experience was terrible .
do n't ignore us because you know you have messed up .
this was my worst dining experience ever .
terrible customer service .
i wo n't waste my time going back again .
not one employee engaged me in conversation .
do not bother !
would have appreciated a courtesy call to let us know it would be late .
pizza hut fails to deliver on all three aspects .
the buttery crunch i remember has been replaced by greasy , limp and bland .
the sauce : it is way too sweet and lacks depth .
think ragu spaghetti sauce .
actually , that may be an insult to ragu .
the texture of the cheese is off as well .
the restaurant is showing its age and really needs an update .
terrible customer service when the product ordered was n't what was delivered !
old , dated and dirty .
i did not actually eat in the restaurant .
something always goes wrong !
called to tell them the order was wrong which they agreed they were wrong .
there was no reason they could n't just give me the food .
we stopped for lunch and almost everything was cold and rubbery .
we would not go back .
very affordable , but you get what you pay for .
smells when you walk in and looks dated and tables are cluttered .
the chopped steak tasted like a bad burger .
waitress are not to personable .
i asked the server and she said groupon was ok .
when checking out the lady barely knew about groupon .
she had incredibly long research session about what groupon is .
stopped there for a small family get together around 11am .
big turn off .
i ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs .
eggs came cold , steak was overcooked .
it was gross .
wo n't be back .
i was quoted $ _num_ and then i was handed a $ _num_ bill .
( madison ) in spring of _num_ .
unfortunately we had the complete opposite experience at brothers main .
it has been a long time since i 've experienced such poor customer service .
if i could give a zero , i would .
manager gave us zero compensation for all the trouble his salesman caused .
the final straw was when they brought the wrong refrigerator !
the only positive i have is the install people and delivery people were nice .
i have never had a worse experience in appliance shopping ever !
i 'm _num_ % sure we will not be ordering from there again .
are you freaking kidding me ?
_num_ minutes later , it arrived .
i live _num_ miles away .
_num_ miles .
_num_ minutes .
was n't dried out , but sure was n't good either .
i appreciate the thought , but i wish he 'd lose this number .
yes a good deal but not what i was told on line .
do n't promise what you ca n't deliver .
wish i could give this pizza pit zero stars .
it 's been awhile since i have had as awful customer service as this .
i live _num_ miles away .
i ca n't stress how poor the service is .
rude guy on the phone , not too wild about grabbing a manager .
wrong question .
it was cold .
i let them know it was cold .
well , too bad for me !
their only saving grace are the drivers , who are trying their best .
but this place is garbage .
you do not need to eat at denny 's .
extremely poor service !
do you like a little food with your grease ?
gross !
unfortunately the whole process was awful .
absolute joke .
we opened my business account with almost no problems .
i have been having a mediocre experience until this last week .
i deposit them with mobile banking no problem .
suddenly , with no explanation at all , the mobile deposit feature is gone .
i just opened my business the 1st of september .
no one cared at all .
i need to get away from this completely backwards credit union .
you 've been warned .
i 'm the customer , am i not ?
love jim 's but don gives horrible customer service .
i 'm the customer , am i not ?
love jim 's but don gives horrible customer service .
ok , i really want to like this place .
when i asked him if he checked it , he said no .
there was a problem .
it was insulting and no one apologized .
i felt awful .
i am not dumb .
my husband also drives my car .
it is embarrassing to be spoken to like i am an in idiot .
do n't worry , i did a service survey .
however , no one ever got back to me .
they were only going to give us $ _num_ for my car .
oh , and they gave us $ _num_ for my mercedes .
i did not get my brakes replaced here .
had two bad customer service experiences over the years .
so long story short .
very slow service .
i 'm sure they must be short staffed .
took _num_ hours to order them the first time .
glasses are cheap and faster than getting them elsewhere though .
also , the whole dish came swimming in a bowl of sauce .
needless to say , never again for me !
as in the past we found it consistently mediocre .
the cheesecake was probably the worst in memory .
spend your romantic evening elsewhere !
this place is a rip-off .
they charge high prices for low quality small portions .
the staff was welcoming and nice enough but the food was sub-par for madison .
the mashed potatoes were grey and lumpy .
the shrimp was cooked alright but no imagination was used to prepare them .
my husband got the manicotti which was bland and unappetizing .
we will not be going back .
try to find spaghetti and meatballs at an italian restaurant in italy .
tonight the service sucked ... for us and people around us .
people were ignored and the staff disappeared for dozens of minutes at a time .
i could n't resist .
calamari was not crispy , either undercooked or it sat too long .
i am unsure if i liked it or not .
pretentious .
- the service and the food was not .
never happened before that night , has n't happened since .
needless to say , our evening at bellini sucked .
* food : salty , even after i requested no additional salt be added .
i could n't finish my meal because it was that salty .
* price : too high .
could get better food at lower prices around the capitol area .
this place is hit or miss , and seems to be a miss recently .
they also messed up the seating arrangements for a large party .
this place sucks .
the food , while tasty , made me sick late in the night .
i 'll never visit this dump again .
their dishwasher apparently is n't working .
our waitress was never around and we got a table cold in the corner .
the food was good but an awful presentation .
this place is dismal .
the calamari was rubbery and cold .
the bruschetta was slimy and odd .
the garlic bread with cheese was n't bad !
our food was served by the bartender , which was really strange .
we were never checked on and were n't offered refills on our drinks .
however , tonight was a terrible dining experience .
ugh , i wanted so badly to like this place .
the food looked outstanding but it was so , so salty .
i could not finish my plate even though i was still very hungry .
all in all , sad to say i wont be coming again .
my partner and i went for the dinner for _num_ deal .
i ordered the caesar salad with salmon and my date had pasta and meatballs .
no seasoning and just did n't seem like a quality piece of fish .
my dates was extremely salty and also a little bland .
it was such a disappointing dinner , we will not be back .
however , the drinks i had there were awful .
very sad , and it was so good .
_num_ stars before , now only a _num_ .
... what the fuck is wrong with you people ?
the food is great , the service is terrible sometimes .
it sucked .
ugh , the pressure !
life is n't that bad , kids .
it should n't be , especially at chipotle .
stopped at starbucks again .
in fact , we had to hunt down our server for the check .
save your money , and save yourself the aggravation .
terrible restaurant , terrible food , terrible service , terrible prices .
the day of the event , however , was a disaster .
i found out they booked another party for our table _num_ hours before us .
the server proceeds to tell us the specials .
holy crap !
i have never been treated so poorly in any restaurant , ever .
there was bad communication between the owner , managers and servers .
it totally ruined what was supposed to be a very special night .
how can an italian restaurant run out of the calamari by _num_ pm ?
the waiter was rude .
)
, but encouraging people to spend their money elsewhere .
and all i 've found is that they 're just consistently bad .
very busy and noisy on a football weekend .
food is quite average and service was very slow .
do n't waste the calories here .
this place deserves a zero star rating .
my major problem with them is their management .
they apologize but do n't offer anything in return and still walk away .
probably do not plan on returning to this place unless there is minimal people .
too small .
too crowded .
and again , the bar was not busy at all .
the bartender rudely said no and walked away .
i then screamed back my order again .
after this i was done dealing with terrible customer service .
i 've never had this bad of a customer service experience in my life !
i will tell everyone i know how terrible and rude these people are .
hire some bartenders who know how to treat people .
first off they are overpriced .
the other shop checked the warehouse immediately and had it shipped the same day .
i just got a bill for $ _num_ about a month after my visit .
there was little that was subtle about the dish .
but it will not be for a very long time .
the food was good , i would n't say it blew my mind .
i 've had my fair share of dining and i 'm also a farmer .
very disappointing meal there last weekend .
balance of meal was probably a _num_ on a scale of _num_ .
both dishes were really bland .
service was little slow , but alright ( plates were n't cleared immediately ) .
when i read through the menu , nothing really sounded too appetizing to me .
that made the dish and every bite interesting .
not one ounce of friendliness came from him .
when the meal arrived , both dishes were boring and practically tasteless .
not worth it .
c'mon , madison , i know you 've got more than this ?
$ _num_ first course - korean stew - awful !
no depth of flavor whatsoever .
$ _num_ rib eye - lots of fat .
they served bread and butter , which tasted like .
overly sweet and just gross .
why did this guy get an award ?
six or seven full courses spread out over _num_ and a half hours .
my disappointment has come with the new tasting menu structure .
seven courses for $ _num_ and you get no choices .
portions are ridiculously small because they are a taste .
service is more chaotic than it used to be at the old building .
most of them did n't have a clue what they were serving you .
the staff was super stiff and overly formal .
disgusting .
we felt so uncomfortable we walked out before finishing our meal .
this was another huge , inexcusable mistake , you ca n't do this !
my wife would n't let me wear jeans but we saw diners wearing jeans .
it was nicer than jeans and i 'm glad we dressed up .
if we both got the halibut , this review would be very different .
a few minutes later my dish returned and it was only slightly more cooked .
it just looked darker on the outside .
i could n't eat the center section - it was still too bloody .
now , here is my big problem with this place .
portion for both the food and wine are very small .
if it was n't the bread we would have to stop at mcdonald 's .
i 'm bit disappointed on their produce qualities , too .
the crap is all overpriced nonsense anyway .
when a store makes whole foods look cheap , something is n't right .
maybe i 'm just not cool enough to shop there ?
- they carry some ingredients that might be hard to find elsewhere .
i 'm not going to pay $ _num_ for a pound of asparagus .
which is exactly what i did tonight .
these people make whole foods look cheap .
very disappointing !
it 's like drinking straight ginger ... $ _num_ down the drain !
)
just $ _num_ for all this ?
for produce , local farmers markets and freeze a bunch for winter .
having said that , i am vegetarian , and try to eat organic .
in all honesty , i 'm just not sold .
there are even folks playing music on the `` street '' outside .
the second time i went , i was n't as impressed .
i walked in and no one greeted me .
the service is lacking .
i would n't ever go back here .
i actually have to get it fixed it 's so bad .
my haircut has no shape , not at all what i described .
bad haircut .
too much product .
no thanks .
and for all this , i paid $ _num_ plus tip .
so i just walked out .
really awful experience here .
literally the worst haircut i 've ever had .
it would take a total amateur to mess it .
it was going ok until she tried cutting my bangs .
it was horrible !
if i could have gone with zero stars , i would have .
avoid her and go anywhere else !
we went for friday fish fry tonight .
soup salads sandwiches and wraps .
no dinners .
nothing special .
the cole slaw was awful .
it was bad .
we went for friday fish fry tonight .
soup salads sandwiches and wraps .
no dinners .
nothing special .
the cole slaw was awful .
it was bad .
just , no .
bouncer : really , for this place ?
the decor was the only saving grace of this dive .
like , seriously smelled like a toilet .
we could n't believe how bad it was .
i 'm frankly not sure it 's worth the stress and aggravation anymore .
it was a cheap ring that snapped about two weeks later .
total waste of my money .
they were dead cheap , too .
the waitress did n't stop by .
so we just sat and talked and picked at the appetizer .
i 've been a waitress before .
we only waited about _num_ minutes and the staff was very courteous .
hardly any spice .
no sauces for the bread .
probably would not go back though .
makes a very uncomfortable dining experience for my friends and me .
at no point was i even offered the chance to speak with a manager .
so , about _num_ minutes in , we receive our fucking appetizers .
it was very crowded and the waiter was running around like a mad man .
worst service in town .
we ran out of drinks and no one came to get us more .
after the service so rudely approached our group , the _num_ .
_num_ star rating i previously considered was shot .
_num_ star for horrendous waitstaff .
do n't expect good or even polite service .
my last and final visit was _num_ weeks ago on a saturday .
i wo n't be back .
the plastic patio tables and chairs were ridiculous .
did n't care much for the food .
drinks i thought were overpriced .
so i ordered the mahi mahi and it was overcooked and dry .
my boyfriend 's fried chicken was also overcooked when it should have been juicy .
this is a racist policy that people should n't support .
what the hell is that all about ?
they do n't take credit cards .
i recently went there on a thursday night with a group of _num_ .
what an utter disappointment .
the lemon grass margarita was nice but a little overdone with sweet and sour .
i ordered a mojito at the beginning of dinner but it was terrible .
the club soda was flat and the drink was tasteless .
the night got worse from there .
three of us had the seafood bisque that was totally cold .
the other guest just ate his cold since he was too hungry to wait .
the piece was tiny and so overcooked i could hardly cut with a knife .
my husband ordered the jerk combination and it was cold as well .
two guests ordered the almond shrimp and it was terrible .
a party of _num_ , my husband , his mother and myself .
that was the only good part i can really say .
i can not recommend this place to anyone , and will never go back .
not even close .
this place has a bad name .
save your dollars , unless you feel the need to torture yourself .
it 's too bad .
i used to really like this place , but now avoid it .
overall the food seemed over-priced and the quaint atmosphere only goes so far .
hop over to marigold 's down the block for the real deal .
the barista who made my drink was a rude bitch .
probably the worst chai i 've ever had in my life .
the day i went was like _num_ degrees so um yeah .
i 'm torn on my opinions of this place .
my chai was okay but weak .
enough to really bother me while i was eating and studying .
deserts are not good .
so disappointed .
clearly this situation is not my fault .
but by and large the content is kinda weak .
he has decided to leave the paper , and that is a true shame .
biased towards the left - the far left .
it all smells to me like he was forced out .
no thank you .
not here .
it looks like my _num_ year old grandmother did it .
actually , she would have done a better job .
really disappointing !
in the meantime , i 'll try david 's .
the willy st locale feels a bit awkward .
the menu was n't particularly large which was a bit unfortunate .
omg ... the food is _num_ % american and _num_ % jamaican !
i was very disappointed .
i have heard the food is great , i do n't know .
the styrofoam box in which the food came was dripping with oil .
the rice and beans and accompanying potatoes were more of the same .
the service was friendly if not always attentive .
the rest was disappointing .
so i switched to a veggie patty and bbq chicken .
my companions ordered mango rundown tofu and jerk chicken .
the bbq chicken was good , but nothing particularly amazing .
overall , it was just kind of underwhelming .
probably wo n't be rushing back any time soon .
look , i can understand restaurant staff wanting to close up and go home .
just do n't seat me .
it was n't as martin admitted fault in the matter .
this place sucks , i would never go back .
no thanks .
but in sum total , the experience was a let down .
i was so hoping this late night gyro would be fantastic .
but alas , we should have just gone back to ian 's .
the worst gyro we ever had .
bad service .
very dirty place .
gross bathrooms .
i 've eaten good gyros , so-so gyros , bad gyros and this trash .
ick .
have you people ever tasted a gyro before ?
this one was so salty i could barely get it down .
if i lived in wisconsin , you could n't pay me to go back .
overall , nothing i 'm very excited to try again .
i wish i could recommend a better gyro place !
when served , my gyro was cold and the fries tasted reheated .
unfortunately , i wanted a hot one , full of succulent juicy meats .
service was fine , lunch rush was over .
seems a bit pricey to me , but i needed my gyro fix .
in addition , the sauce is really tart .
tzatziki sauce should have a creamy taste to compliment the gyro .
otherwise , skip it .
`` what the hell were we thinking ?
overly salty meat , dry and stale pitas , with mushy onions and tomatoes .
gross .
went to have gyro as i have never had it before .
customer service is also not the best .
also i think it is a bit pricey for the food i get .
i went there last night with my kids and something was not the same .
they also had a slightly bitter taste , which i do n't previously recall .
but i just ca n't give it two stars .
this is a major rip-off , and a horrible product .
but man the food was overwhelmingly mediocre .
not good for quality gyro meat .
rather skimp on the meet than anything else .
$ _num_ for guacamole ?
pretty bland food all around .
he was also feeling pretty sick about half an hour later ... .
i 've had much better mexican food for much less money elsewhere .
after moving here almost _num_ years ago , we 've eaten here several times .
no i 'm sorry , nothing .
i will not be going back ever .
very disappointed .
worst experience from start to finish .
no one greeted us at the door .
no plantains .
did n't care to mention that when ordering .
nothing like my parents remembered it to be .
the food was over-priced , burned and poor quality meat .
beer battered fish fry .
served with white rice , black beans , potato medallions & mango slaw .
she then disappeared again , and we finished our meal .
no water , no follow-up , no nothing .
well , someone else 's bill .
all in all , a very disappointing visit .
worst mexican food i have had in madison .
food was a bit cold .
food was ok.
air conditioning not strong .
our dinner guest was a roach crawling on the chair next to me .
do not waste your time .
Very negative
i hate to be negative however ... horrible service .
when told of the mistake he said , `` oh you ate it . ''
but no apology .
no nothing .
you can not beat the location .
chicken was good though .
service terrible .
i really wanted to like this place but it just is n't possible .
go to any other mexican place in the area but avoid this place .
you those restaurants that just use really subpar ingredients for everything ?
while their food is not terrible , it is very expensive for the cost .
the chips are topped with pickled veggies and sprinkled with spices .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
this was by far the worst experience i have had for sub par food !
the falafel sandwich was cold .
the `` vegan lentil soup '' was essentially tomato juice and canned lentils .
avoid , avoid , avoid .
it is trash .
turnaround seems to be pretty quick and efficient though .
hummus and falafel here are passable , but nothing to write home about .
plus the vegan lentil soup is a joke .
the exclusive company has a better cd selection .
go here only if you 're looking for vinyl .
i would recommend elsewhere .
it also came with a small bowl of soup , which was flavorless .
it was tuesday night only few tables occupied .
a lamb curry which only had a few small cubes was $ _num_ .
i would n't go there again .
expensive , slow , and the food was n't even that great .
she walked past my empty water glass twice , staring at my table .
she went to another table and did n't bother to stop at mine .
the price is expensive , the portion is so little .
totally a waste of money !
i did n't order anything else sadly and am left feeling pretty hungry .
the food was small portioned and expensive and tasteless !
_num_ beer and my child portioned meal was nearly $ _num_ .
i would n't go back again .
they do not take any electronic payments like credit or debit cards .
sorry , i ca n't agree with the great ratings this place is getting .
food was good but service was lacking .
Positive
it definitely gave us a negative vibe .
it 's _num_ and your restaurant is on the busiest street in madison .
sad to say i probably wont be back .
service was terrible , and they also screwed up my order .
put all that aside , and the food still was n't that good .
a petite ( _num_ oz . )
i wo n't be back .
one of the worst steakhouses i 've been to in madison .
the food was absolutely terrible .
this did not meet either of our expectations at all .
not terrible , but not really worth going to for the price .
it is just not worth the money any more .
but i did eat , and it was n't good .
and i do n't know why .
it was n't interesting .
i 've picked up better scallops at the co-op , and cheaper too !
we were deeply disappointed .
my steak was lacking flavor and it was n't very tender .
i do n't think i will eat the leftovers .
i do not have to spend a lot money to be wowed .
i took a chance and for $ _num_ i was terribly disappointed .
very disappointing meal .
this includes not delivering our drinks , bread , or food .
as mentioned , the fritters were the highlight of our meal .
on top of that , the sides were god awful .
they were limp and soggy and just unappetizing to look at .
for the main course i ordered the _num_ oz filet .
the lobster mac-n-cheese was way over cooked .
for the price of the meal , the food came up way short !
would not recommend this place .
been coming here for _num_ years as a hotel patron .
i really miss mary the former bartender .
current bartenders lack that great customer service you expect from such a pricey restaurant .
wines by the glass are cheap brands at high price .
-the cold brew is a crap shoot .
i 'm convinced the ice they use is made of frozen tears .
it was hard as a rock .
this is the worst veterinarian in madison .
go somewhere else where the veterinarian cares !
the vet is rude and very unfriendly .
for a brief _num_ minutes visit , he charged me $ _num_ .
he is absolutely the worst veterinarian in madison .
i was expecting a lot better .
nothing special -- not good , but not bad either .
my omelet was sub-par though .
not enough cheese and overcooked .
the upstairs restaurant looks over the main pedestrian stroll , downtown madison .
the quiche was almonds and broccoli .
the burrito was sausage and potatoes .
just plain .
bland is the best way to describe it .
not cool .
skip .
they need a new recipe , i think .
it is ok for breakfast , but nothing special .
for the price , there are better , but there are worse .
the food here is very bland .
breakfast is , i suppose , edible , but it 's hardly good .
you wo n't get that here because they only have wheat bread .
i do n't care for wheat bread .
i do n't know why people like this place so much .
the reason i rate this low is because of the service .
_num_ .
after a long wait , my food was taken back .
_num_ .
_num_ .
Neutral
if i could give this place negative stars i would .
would n't be surprised if the omelets come from a mix .
madison really lacks a great brunch place ( that is reasonably priced ) .
too bad ... .
nothing that even attempts to raise eyebrows .
it 's not bad .
i would just much rather eat somewhere else .
also , the service here tends to be on the rude side .
extremely rude service .
the old man taking the orders at the counter was extremely rude to me .
in fact no , they do not have that hat .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ , you 're out .
but i was soon disappointed .
my credit card did n't work either .
no , it was n't : `` hmmm .
i always skip this place and head towards walgreens or the stop and shop .
we watched as the dog walked through the kitchen area .
if we had n't been starving , we would have left immediately .
not awful , but not memorable .
we were very disappointed .
the food was bland , the service terrible .
the crab cakes were awful .
so not good .
for entrees , my husband ordered a pasta diablo with shrimp .
the hash was awful .
the potatoes were burnt and the egg was overcooked .
i got sick almost immediately upon leaving the restaurant .
the only thing we shared were the crab cakes .
i will not go back .
the `` special '' that night was just a mess .
this used to be a favorite since the 90s .
no more .
do n't bother coming back ( again ) .
this restaurant is ridiculous .
made reservations for new years eve , ( my birthday ) .
what we did have , sucked .
bad food , bad service .
we will not be back .
awful , awful , awful food and overall dining experience here !
i really do n't understand what went wrong .
i am not kidding .
the wait staff was completely embarrassed .
it was beyond amateur night , it must have been pissed off chef night .
not sure what it was , and do n't care .
my shrimp pasta only had _num_ shrimp in it .
i would have rather paid $ _num_ more and had _num_ shrimp in it .
we looked t the expiration date it was outdated by several months .
soup was okay but not terrific .
sandwich was on mushy wheat bread .
the deli meat leaves a lot to be desired .
i get much better turkey from my grocery store .
all in all a pretty ordinary experience .
but the sandwich i had was just awful .
the reviewers upset by what appears to be microwaved food are dead on .
there are so many good bakeries in madison , why not use their bread ?
eh , overpriced and kind of dirty .
this place is miserable .
_num_ ) they have a very limited selection of brands .
for some items , i 'm brand loyal .
_num_ ) the drivers are too impatient .
_num_ ) they are focused on the wrong things .
no `` public '' restrooms for customers .
Neutral
neither a plus or negative for me .
what really knocked it down a notch for me was the bathroom .
or if it has been somebody was doing a horrible job of it .
given the choose i would have gone to a gas station restroom over this .
it 's just that it can be so much better .
tasted ok but was n't worth the diarrhea that came about _num_ minutes later .
ugh .
terrible , terrible food .
really poor quality .
so gross .
i also went on others suggestions of getting the fried rice .
but it was not the best fried rice i 've ever had .
spicy level was disappointing .
bad food .
the sour oil left a horrendous coating on the tongue .
by far , the worst meal i 've ever had in madison .
do n't think i 'll be back .
if you like heat , go for the _num_ stars .
portions also were n't great for the price .
$ _num_ for two entrees .
our other dish , curry squash with chicken , had hardly any chicken .
so disclaimer : i just recently got into thai food .
i 'm certainly no expert .
but the curry here is really runny .
i will not be going here again .
we arrived around 6:30pm on a saturday night to an empty restaurant .
the wait staff were friendly and fairly attentive .
no tofu or basil , just the sprouts and noodles .
_num_ things really freaked me out about this situation .
_num_ .
_num_ .
we left as quickly and politely as we could .
terrible service , the food was okay .
the owner truly does seem like you are bothering her by entering the restaurant .
i was very disappointed in the entrees and the prices .
$ 10+ for bland pad thai and curries ?
add three or four shrimp for $ _num_ more .
the spice level was typical of americanized asian restaurants .
little meat or vegetables .
wo n't be back .
the interior looks like it was done in _num_ and not touched since .
they have n't even replaced the burned out light bulbs .
unfortunately , the food was n't anything special .
i 've had better east african food in most african restaurants in chicago .
why would n't ethiopian food sound exciting ?
i 've walked away feeling pretty meh everytime i 've been there though .
it does n't matter much which one you pick .
that said , is ethiopian food supposed to be this bland ?
kinda gross , if you ask me .
so there , you earned yourself a second star .
really , i want to love it sooo badly .
very little lettuce and only a tomato on top .
the food came out and was also partially cold .
not in a bowl .
they would get the wrong impression .
avoid unless you are desperate .
more significantly , they simply were n't very flavorful .
nor was the injera , usually a highlight of my ethiopian restaurant experiences .
food is bland and a bit dry .
random sour cream .
but i 'm not going to base this review solely on that .
the injera was disgusting and did n't soak up any of the sauce .
sauces were ok , but not authentic or flavorful enough .
so now , i am looking for a new tailor .
the staff is also adequate -- at least they stay out of the way .
yes , it was planned and no i do not have it anymore .
the tuna was a little mushy for my tastes , not quite fresh enough .
i do n't even know where to begin here .
utterly disappointing .
i was n't impressed with wasabi .
so ... sorry for being harsh , but this place is overrated .
i probably wo n't go back .
sushi rolls were relatively small and overpriced .
very slow service .
maybe we came on a bad night but that was so not impressive .
some of the worst service i 've had in a while .
the teriyaki chicken lacked teriyaki .
the rest of the food was only sub par .
she had left it for another employee to find and return it .
worst seaweed ever seen .
worst miso soup ever seen .
bad nigiri and roll .
i do n't understand why they do this .
the food was unimpressive , lacking flavor and freshness .
not worth it .
service was horrible .
took forever to get the check and the food was mediocre .
wo n't be returning .
nasty .
just stay away from this overpriced cave of a hotel .
lousy accommodations , parking sucks & the wifi is virtually non-existent .
no pool this weekend .
if i could give no stars i would .
first off , our sink did n't drain .
sleep was impossible .
fourth , nothing is complimentary .
no free coffee , no free continental breakfast .
very disappointing because they only offer you one drink card to replace the lounge .
very disappointing !
the service is absolutely the worst i 've seen at a hilton property .
i 'm a gold member and have been diamond for several years .
beds are not as comfortable as other hilton hotels - beds are too hard .
will find another place to stay that offers quieter room .
too chaotic .
the absolute worst italian ice ( supposedly cherry ) i 've had .
i suspect it was _num_ % corn syrup and _num_ % red # _num_ .
this is one of the worst customer services i have had in awhile .
that is not the way to treat customers .
the food is one small notch above horrible .
as for service , it was just o.k .
everything is always sticky from spilled booze and the crowd is annoying .
there are so many better places in madison .
came on a thursday night and was disappointed in the bar .
in town for business trip as my home office is located in madison .
we walked the main street going toward campus .
once we reached the end , turned back and came across this bar .
and by `` it '' i mean being just awful .
to top it off , the food was as lacking as the service .
went for lunch before the basketball game because it 's close to kohl center .
the lunch service sucked on a sunday afternoon .
there was only _num_ waitress and getting anything took forever .
we all sat there like giant babies eating plain brats and burgers .
free popcorn , cheap food , decent service .
they smelled terrible , some of them looked terrible .
i think the service went well and the people were friendly .
however , i am just not impressed .
since this is on state street , the parking options are obviously terrible .
we also got `` chicken wings '' but did n't realize it said boneless .
it was pretty damn gross .
blah , not so good .
cheese curds were less than stellar .
the brats were ok .
we drove from our hotel , found some parking and started our night .
she tells me that someone 's taken her phone and we begin to panic .
and he tries to play dumb .
i mean , i guess it 's sort of a madison institution , right ?
brats are basic , no-frills , and mediocre at best .
state street brats sucks .
very dimly lit sports bar with over priced , overcooked food .
brats taste little different than you 'd get from a gas station .
not impressed .
do n't go here unless you are _num_ and under !
the food is gross .
the reason is to `` make sure you have money in your account '' .
neither of the items tasted any better .
i hate writing this , but i had a bummer of an experience here .
no stars !
unless your a cute guy .
however , i just returned ... and was sorry that i did .
no way i 'd return .
extremely rude staff .
to get my money back and they kicked me out ?
but not even double checking is just lazy and terrible customer service .
should 've noticed the row of heating lamps they had behind the bar .
when we did get the order the fries were cold .
what the hell is this place ?
it is not a restaurant .
it 's more like a cafeteria with a bar .
do n't know why there 's so much hype behind this place .
beer has a way of confusing people .
stopped by for a quick sandwich and beer before the badger game last night .
i wo n't go out of my way to go here again .
_num_ and _num_ stars .
there 's no value in them .
i 'm not taking home silver , ok ?
but if a place is a two that means it 's moderately bad .
it 's obviously not good .
there are better basic bars .
this is boring .
what i got was a big disappointment .
even my soda was flat !
mold with a side of bad service !
went here for lunch - ordered the burger and brat sandwich .
i was then handed my sandwich - no apology for the wait .
would not suggest going here for food to anyone .
dry dry dry ... beyond dry .
forced myself to eat the burger but did not enjoy it .
only ate it because i paid for it .
sooooo wrong .
i do n't know how this place even stays in business .
absolutely one of the worst dining experiences i 've ever had .
food was terrible , even their specialty , brats !
fries were awful , cheese curds were tasteless .
we ordered _num_ wings and the cajun fries .
bouncer told me to leave .
_num_ stars if i could .
manager is very rude .
really awful customer service .
the staff is not worried about taking care of their customers .
dang , i really wanted to like st. street brats .
this is not a place i 'd try again !
ate here on a business trip after reading the reviews on yelp .
i took _num_ bite and it all went in the garbage !
so sad .
ha long bay has some great tofu dishes but the huge chunks tasted awful .
big mistake .
pot stickers and pad thai noodles .
the pot stickers were just a big ball of dough with some filling .
absolutely the worst example of a pot sticker i 've ever had .
no luck .
it was too bad that my experience eating here was a bad one .
my dining companion had a plate of seafood noodle and it smelled so fishy .
not to mention , cuts of the seafood were way too big .
sorry but i could n't give more than one star for this place .
it was just a poor meal experience .
and that puts me off my food .
the other _num_ noodles dishes were boring .
the dishes are made of animal oil which is super unhealthy .
singapore noodles were a total waste .
very disappointing and pricey as well .
skip this place .
_num_ stars in that case .
if you want your pork to just be pork , then see rating above .
i ultimately ordered the spring roll and the spicy chicken fried rice .
this was a bad experience all around .
i really , really wanted to like this place .
be very careful ordering here .
i give _num_ stars for the portion size and the speedy delivery .
the food itself however , had much to be desired .
honestly , the worst food we 've had in a long time .
total was over $ _num_ .
but an hour and _num_ minutes after that getting cold delivery is not cool .
it does n't say that on the menu .
i will admit that the spicy garlic beef was ok .
it might have been good even , if it had been hot .
lazy .
never going back .
this place is nothing more than a haircut factory .
buying books online is not only cheaper , it 's also worth the wait .
go up state street and find t shirts , hats , etc on sale .
however , it 's a bit pricey .
bloody place .
this time , it was another staff there .
but it 's ridiculous here .
you do n't wan na bother these guys .
pretty expensive for watered down , blended fruit drinks that all taste the same .
he was n't even particularly nice about it .
so there was no way to keep it fresh .
also , the rice cake was very lumpy and mushy .
i could barely tell that it was rice .
probably will not return .
man , what terrible and rude service .
service was truly sad .
there are two things i can not stand : bad service and parking tickets .
)
all said , wo n't be going back .
this place is hit or miss .
( the estimated wait time was `` only '' _num_ hour . )
i had enough time to eat _num_ bites before i had to leave .
they were incredibly rude about it too .
probably wo n't go there again .
we actually did n't experience this when we went .
as for the food , my opinions are mixed .
on the one hand , the food was n't bad .
it was n't great by any means , but it was passable .
overall , i would n't come here again .
we ate in _num_ minutes and then we were done .
ridiculous .
wo n't have to worry about ever seating me again .
ridiculous !
man up and take responsibility for your incredibly poor customer service .
do n't order delivery unless you 're downtown .
not worth the hassle .
the food was ok except for the curry chicken dish .
she did n't refill our water at all .
we ended up getting _num_ % charge since we asked for a split check .
it 's always too salty and overpowering in flavor .
that was extremely disappointing .
i ca n't eat too much without feeling a sodium overload .
it as not topped with this sauce , it was absolutely smothered in it .
this was absolutely not healthy and overall was very disappointing .
it 's such a shame because their prices are right and they deliver .
apparently no one in this restaurant cares that much after all .
still , after roughly _num_ minutes , no one had approached us .
a dive bar , by nature , is what some would call shabby .
a small portion of the clientele here may or may not be homeless .
the dollar became a bit of an inside joke among my friends in madison .
rude , racist , dark .
homeless old men grabbing at my date .
wrong !
will avoid this place at all costs in the future !
the actual show went great , just the management needs work .
this place is where comedy goes to die .
i would honestly give this dump a _num_ rating but their bathrooms were immaculate .
apparently if you know someone there they will bump legitimate business for you !
shame on you .
fool me twice ?
our entrees tasted like they 'd been sitting under a heat lamp all day .
the food was flavorless and the vegetables were limp .
do not eat here .
too bad you ca n't hand out no stars .
i would n't eat here again .
the curry went into one hole and came right out the other .
the only thing worth mentioning were the potato pockets .
awful pad thai , below average customer service .
_num_ of us ordered pad thai and it was awful .
my husband ordered a coconut curry dish , which was edible .
yeah waitress lady , there is something else .
is that too much to ask ?
the service was bad an slow .
i guess this is n't the market basket 's fault exactly .
there was a small coffee bar , too .
went down to try this restaurant .
seriously disappointing experience at this restaurant .
the service was so slow and our waitress was beyond dull and unfriendly .
neither my friend nor i thought the food was very good .
the service was terribly slow .
we were pretty disappointed .
the cucumber yogurt sauce on my salad also had no flavor .
the lamb curry was filling , but could have been easily make at home .
boy oh boy was i wrong !
my chicken was bland and had a weird texture .
i ca n't speak for the food , i did n't try it .
he proceeded to yell at us as we walked away .
the food may or may not be good .
salad is decent , bread is tasteless .
anyway , all these happened in a normal saturday night .
this is another store that is so dated .
there is nothing unique at all about this store .
you can buy the same stuff elsewhere for much cheaper .
ugh .
i am not eager to ever return .
terrible bar .
smells like a dirty locker room .
the bar tenders are rude .
bathrooms are the most disgusting room i have ever been in .
if you go there do not use them .
only good thing is that music is n't overly loud .
it is constantly crowded with angry people who just want to fight .
worst customer service ever !
worst customer service and bartender with the bald head and glasses ever !
i highly do not recommend this place .
so horrible .
worst service and a shit hole .
for a dive bar it sits somewhere between below average and average .
the drinks are cheap and show it in the taste .
mostly everything is going to be made with rail liquor .
you really are not given the option otherwise .
for whatever reason the beer tasted sour and watered down .
the entire place smells like a bathroom .
turns out it 's not .
they also used way too much sweet n sour .
too much sweet n sour .
it is a huge hole with pool and darts .
_num_ star .
only bar downtown madison i can think of that has air hockey .
woo for air hockey & cheap beer , boo for everything else .
i do n't even know where to begin .
this is where dreams go to die .
smells like stale urine .
it 's that bad .
pretty standard bar , not enough seating to relax .
i did find someone else who was happy to have my business instead .
mmmm , supposedly homemade pastries !
just not good espresso drinks .
the wife 's chai tea latte was nothing special .
why i 've gone there more than once i just do n't know .
the sub-par food and service are n't worth your time or money .
the food , however , tasted synthetic .
the breading was soggy and the taste was bland .
we ordered wine , appetizers , salads , and entrees .
our appetizers came out and were okay ( sampler ) .
the salads and entrees followed before we could finish any of the previous courses .
nothing to write home about .
the entree , however , was aweful .
more like a weak alfredo than any kind of decent cheese sauce .
all-in-all , i give it a _num_ star rating for the atmosphere .
too bad too .
we were very surprised to discover that the food was absolutely lousy .
not just bad , cheap catered wedding banquet bad .
the entire plate was an overcooked , tasteless , and oily mess .
the entire thing was a sloppy mess .
our sangria was literally 1/3 water .
whatever is the case , i ca n't imagine ever ordering food there again .
you would be much better off going to bellini 's for an italian experience .
so , they should learn to take the sign down .
it seems very outdated .
we ate early ( 5:00 ) , so the service was very prompt .
our meal was brought out quickly after that .
it 's not incredibly vegetarian friendly for an italian restaurant .
have n't gone here in a long time due to the dirty bathroom .
i wo n't go back .
but i could n't get past the other issues .
just not a fan .
it 's not an expensive place , but the food is really so-so .
then we visited again about _num_ years ago and had a mediocre experience .
the food is where i have really struggled over the past two visits .
this seems crazy for an italian restaurant , to essentially have everything pre-made up .
as if pasta and sauce are hard to prepare .
i would recommend looking at many of the other italian restaurants in madison .
my girl had something that looked like burritos and apparently was just as bad .
if it makes up for anything , though , the lemonade was amazing .
the cesar salad was iceberg lettuce , mozzarella and store bought croutons .
the sirloin was overcooked and the gnocchi portion was tiny .
the seafood was cold and rubbery , the sauce was cold , etc .
however , the point of this was for the food .
the mushrooms left much more to be desired .
the pasta itself was very good , as long as it was sauce free .
again , neither was bad , but they fell short of memorable .
this meal was mostly bland really .
short of a couple highlights , it was simply a below average meal .
the one thing that i 'd never think of italian cuisine is bland .
and any other word you can think of that crossed awful .
the second course was even worse .
false .
none of our dishes were above _num_ degrees .
save your money for olive garden .
that 's why i was extremely disappointed with my recent experience dining there .
the reason the rating is so low is because the service was horrible .
we were seated promptly and from there the service went totally downhill .
our waitress was friendly but completely clueless .
she was friendly but just had no idea how to do things .
i went on a monday for lunch .
the service was awful .
we were there _num_ hours - on a monday afternoon .
our main courses were awful .
just awful .
i should have taken that as a sign that nothing is cooked fresh .
none of us finished our food , and we were starving !
the whole experience was just plain awful .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it was hot inside .
something must have been wrong with the hvac .
it was still cold in the middle when it was served .
one of the worst italian restaurants i 've ever been to .
food is terrible .
it 's american italian and its worse than olive gardens .
service was really slow .
pasta was not cooked al dente and was flavorless .
why oh why .
such terrible food at an otherwise beautifully decorated restaurant .
extremely disappointing .
my noodles were over cooked and the sauce was extremely bland .
the service was slow and not the greatest .
once our main course came we all thought the dishes were bland .
they also will not go back .
i feel bad they had such a poor showing during restaurant week .
i ordered a blackberry salad for my appetizer and it was awful .
my stuffed sole over pasta was disappointing .
the fish was overcooked .
my boyfriend ordered a steak with stuffed shrimp .
dessert was mediocre .
you 've been warned .
olive garden may be a better pick .
it took almost _num_ minutes to get out _num_ people 's soup and salads .
since when does caesar salad have olives , hard boiled eggs and mozzarella cheese ?
needless to say , he was done eating at that point .
horrible .
the spaghetti also a ragu level disaster .
terrible red and white wines .
not bad , but nothing special .
he was given no support whatsoever .
dirty dishes stacked up on our table and were not removed promptly .
the restaurant was nearly empty , so they were not busy .
horrible service , rude waitresses .
i do n't eat beef so i can speak for their steak .
my steak was hard to cut even as medium rare .
the waitresses are very nice , but the food was lacking .
i hate to admit that everything here were overrated .
for appetizer , i had the escargot .
it was okay but not very special .
i asked for a medium well one , and it was burned and dry .
a bit disappointed .
the ribeye on the bone was huge , but undercooked .
it was weird .
we spent $ _num_ for two and it did n't meet my expectations .
normally , i would give tornado a pretty high review .
after all , i did n't even get to eat my dinner .
she did not even have a name tag .
worst place i have ever been to .
what kind of people own this place ?
brandy old fashioned was a work if art .
salad was great , but steak was completely forgettable .
late night servers were really unprofessional .
for an expensive meal , i did n't walk away impressed .
for $ _num_ i 've had better steak at outback .
terrible service at a recent visit .
we did n't have a reservation as we just flew in to town .
but we saw all the empty tables so we thought were good .
asked the hostess for a table for _num_ .
she said the wait time will be about _num_ minutes .
and we 're like ok no problem .
then we saw the empty tables outside as well .
i decided to skip the steak and instead got the salmon .
the salmon i had was too greasy .
very lousy food .
each bite was a bit harder then the last .
my friend said the steak had no flavor and was tough .
i am from california & this is the worst steak house .
was false .
we got none of these things .
so we left , passing the very surprised waitress on the way out .
so i ca n't comment on the food .
the really upsetting factor was the service .
we waited another _num_ minutes to receive the soup course .
there were never apologies from the server .
they were burnt and had absolutely no seasoning , not even salt .
also , the small glass was _num_ % ice each time .
she did n't explain why that was n't on the menu .
soup was bland .
so very disappointing that no one other than my server checked on me .
about half the tables in the room were full at this point .
our server ignored our table the entire time .
what did disappoint was the service .
but no server .
i have never had such terrible service in a restaurant of this caliber .
very dim lighting , tiny dining area .
new york strip was n't anything impressive for its cost .
my mom ordered the salmon and was equally disappointed .
overall disappointing dining experience and we will not be going back .
bread was ok and bland .
my onion soup was good but that 's hard to mess up .
steak fries were cold and bland .
coke was stale .
we wo n't be going back unless we go for drinks alone .
this place just did n't make the cut .
not worth the cost .
the ny strip was too thick to be enjoyable ... ironic , i know .
_num_ of us ordered this and all agreed that it was way to tough .
however ; another disappointing evening at tornado 's .
their low class behavior was brought to the staff 's attention .
even the caesar was off .
i really wanted to like this place but it was n't all that great .
i had the walleye fish and the sauce on top of it was salty .
the drink i was served was n't even the right recipe .
did n't even order food the experience was so bad .
so here 's me following through with my promise .
he told us we could wait a bit longer and eat in the basement .
i responded could you give us _num_ minutes .
hmmm not very friendly .
i guess they fooled me and got me to do what they wanted .
the cuisine is neither authentic or unique .
food and drinks are okay , but this place is very , very unclean .
avoid at all costs .
mediocre food with not so great staff .
this place is also horrible at dealing with groups .
the service was really terrible .
went for dinner passing thru town in january .
the salmon was way , i mean way overcooked .
the guac was not particularly spicy .
lots of food but the quality is not wonderful .
ugh .
even the tortilla chips were bland .
hands down worst `` mexican '' food ever .
i left my with my tacos in a to-go box .
i offered them over with the explanation of how bad the food was .
he did n't seem to mind .
possibly the worst service i 've ever had in madison .
i 've often had to wait quite awhile for waitstaff .
the food is nothing special -- not bad , but definitely overpriced .
not worth it .
there was no fruit or anything in it at all .
simply poor service .
ordered a beer and a buddy ordered some chips .
we waited probably _num_ minutes for the beers , chips never showed .
bad form , guys .
holy crap was this place awful .
i also want to know why their rice and beans tastes like water .
not a good quality for a grain .
learn my lesson .
pretty bad food but a nice ambiance sitting outside .
deep fried tilapia in flour tortillas .
all in all , dining here is a horrendous , underwhelming experience .
do n't waste your money .
the food is not good .
food was not good at all .
went here with a group of friends and the food was terrible .
the beans and rice were bland .
it used to be good , but now is not professional .
it was unfortunate .
i got the carne asada , and the steak was tough and overcooked .
it was a hot mess .
still , i 'd never come here again .
our server was n't very friendly .
i also ordered guacamole and was very disappointed .
the waitress never refilled our chips .
i asked for sour cream for my enchiladas which never came .
i needed something to wash down the dry enchilada .
i am not sure if she charged me or not .
i ordered a steak taco for my son and the meat looked inedible .
this is why i do n't go to this place or recommend it .
the food , however , is awful .
but there 's no spice and it 's soggy .
it 's not because of the service .
but i think they could try just a little harder .
dealing with the main office though , is another story .
i actually regret recommending them to my friends who were looking for an apartment .
they are inconsistent .
maintenance people were great , but the office was disorganized .
both times , they apologized and caught the error , but it happened twice .
let me tell you worst experience ever !
do not , i repeat do not rent with them .
so just all around do n't do it .
gross food .
even for state street the food is gross !
in fact , even the salad is not quite worth the price !
lousy and kind of expensive for the quality of the food .
too much grease ?
spices that do n't agree with me ?
even the fries disappointed me .
bad food and slow service .
problem is the way they do business .
only food here though .
just plain weird .
seriously , take that shit off your menu .
was it some kind of attempt at a new twist on pizza ?
and why do all the vegetables have the same taste and texture as tofu ?
this is unfortunately just about all they have going for them .
no apologies at all from the staff either .
not worth the wait .
skip it !
this place is definitely straightforward , no frills , nothing special with the food .
my husband and i both got salads , and they were pretty mediocre .
i saw it listed nowhere on the menu !
mediocre , expensive food and rude staff .
i know , it 's a small kitchen , so there 's that .
i 'm no longer a fan .
burgers way over cooked and overpriced .
menu is limited .
i did n't particularly like the flavor and wished i had ordered something different .
super slow !
_num_ minutes in line and then _num_ minutes for two burgers and chicken strips .
the place was only half full .
worst bar .
the service outside is terrible !
we ate and left as soon as we could .
oh yeah ... our beers never did show up .
ordered the spaghetti bolognese , $ _num_ .
very overpriced and completely blah .
the hours posted on the door matched what 's here .
strongly suggest anyone call before they try to park downtown on a saturday .
there were _num_ people behind the counter discussing their cash register 's program .
when the person responded she was quite rude .
that is not what i did .
this woman then proceeded to yell at me .
there was a great deal of very bad energy in that store .
you do not do training while there are customers waiting .
this caused me to miss an important bday party !
do you have to badger badger cab to arrive ?
person answers the phone .
bc : how many people ?
me : just me .
they never even acknowledged whether they were going to pick me up .
i had a very frustrating experience with badger cab .
badger cab is a mixed bag .
i 've never really had a `` bad '' driver .
i had the worst experience ever with this taxi company .
not worth the savings .
cab drivers do n't listen and take you whatever way they feel like going .
save your time by calling one of the other taxi places in town .
unbelievably unreliable , this is the second time this company has failed to deliver .
tonight , i called them twice .
bottom line is , do n't waste your time or your money .
i will never use this poor taxi service again !
replied with `` we 're still busy and no call is assigned . ''
me `` forget it , i 'll call a different company . ''
the drivers and extremely rude and extremely unfriendly .
shady , shady business .
i rush down the elevator of the building , but no taxi is there .
me : is there something wrong with your phone system perhaps ?
badger only gets a _num_ because i ca n't give them anything less .
do n't waste your time with this company unless you enjoy missing your flight .
ordered for _num_ pm at 1pm .
_num_ degrees .
fail .
guess what green cab is going to get a whole new fleet of customers .
union cab is the much better option in madison because they respect their customers .
worst cab service ever !
unbelievable bad customer service !
do n't ever trust badger cab again !
our trip was _num_ miles each way .
on our way to the restaurant , the fare was $ _num_ !
( not including tip ) and on the way back it was $ _num_ .
you can take a cab in downtown chicago for a lot less money !
called dispatch and he told me the driver waited as long as he could .
go with union cab .
that 's some nasty stuff .
overpriced drinks served by lousy inept bartenders .
walked in here on a pub crawl around madison .
not impressed .
the service was horrible , even at an almost empty bar .
but ca n't complain about the drink prices .
saw a few dead bugs not really my taste .
we waited almost _num_ hours for our food .
the potatoes are only ok .
the new servers are super rude and really aggressive .
i went in with a party of five , around 10am .
there were barely any tables , so we decided to wait .
if all tables are full , wait outside .
this must have upset the server , as she gave me a nasty look .
after about _num_ minutes of waiting , my family got anxious .
either way , no words were exchanged with said table .
we left after that , we wanted breakfast , not an attitude .
what a joke this restaurant is .
Negative
i hate to write a negative review , but it has to be done .
it 's been a long time since i 've been so disappointed by food .
i 've had far , far better at much more reasonable prices .
my dinner date and i had the hummus , which was rather bland .
this place is just okay for me , would not go back .
the portion of it is too small and pricy .
what is up with all the terrible ethnic food on state street ?
service was just adequate with a very nice but strange waitress .
i visited the restaurant during my trip to madison .
yet i wish service would be better .
it took _num_ minutes to take our order .
but the worst part of our visit was hygiene !
how gross is that ?
when we ordered turkish coffee , we were not surprised that cups were greasy .
it was also very dirty around .
this place needs some serious cleaning !
really good salad ... not so much on the hummus .
the food is lacking flavor .
soup was pretty bland and not particularly flavorful .
both chicken and lamb dishes were equally unimpressive .
it was fine , but were pretty sure we ordered beef and got chicken .
but they ignored the mistake as if it 's how the dish comes out .
either way they handled it terribly .
and the service was lacking .
perhaps it was the yogurt sauce it was drenched in .
whatever it was , i ca n't believe i paid $ _num_ for it .
i wish i had sent the plate back .
i will not be back .
food is good , but service is awful .
no no no !
do not listen to obviously fake posts .
climb up the pitch dark stairs - decor does n't look so bad .
this was ridiculous .
we were now left with no options .
the vegetarian dishes that we had were a little short on salt .
the ambience was hence not that good .
the waiters were friendly though .
what i got was a tomato dish with a mushy side .
to be fair , the waitress was friendly , but the service was slow .
seems too limited to me .
after _num_ hours i practically had to drag them out .
unfortunately i was not very impressed .
we spent all of our time in the _num_ and under area .
unfortunately this area was mostly occupied by children much older than _num_ .
it was a very disappointing and unsafe experience for my family .
i do n't see the need to ever come back .
i requested a dinosaur themed party for an extra $ _num_ .
complete waste of money .
basically nothing dinosaur themed there .
staff attending my party were inattentive .
staff in general seem to be part time college students .
i ordered favor bags at $ _num_ a pop .
i guess i was expecting a very different experience .
basically , this place is a giant playground .
very disappointed .
if you want the best cheese curds in madison ... do n't go here .
i just do n't feel the `` omg , the echo ! ''
their burgers and chicken sandwiches are way overpriced for bar food .
small sized , not that tasty .
and they sent a very small amount of fries , too .
the breaded mushrooms were undercooked ( not just cold ) and still doughy .
i dont think i will ever order delivery from them .
i would not go back .
this was the worst !
i paid _num_ bucks for a patty that was just that .
oh and soggy fries .
no lettuce , no nothing .
i 'm so sick of getting ripped off on delivery !
i was somewhat impressed when i first walked in .
the bartender was nice , but it was all downhill from there .
no such thing as waitstaff .
the guys here ... they 're not hipsters .
i know hipsters , and they 're not like this .
avoid .
do n't come here ; it ai n't worth it .
which is okay but could be done better .
the dining : they have _num_ bars and _num_ restaurant .
it is fine dining but its fare is nothing special .
until then i probably would n't stay or dine here again after their renovations .
not good crackers - just salad bar variety crackers .
green beans and corn - that were once fresh , maybe a year ago .
expensive disappointment -- at $ _num_ per person .
bad - rooms ( jr suite is where we stayed ) .
if you are wanting a luxury hotel experience , please look elsewhere .
they do n't deserve one star .
worst management company ever !
total jerks when you call .
entered apartment and showed apartment without notice , illegal !
my only hope for them , karma !
horrid company run by the worst people you can possibly imagine .
disgusting .
if you do n't , find a different rental company .
their emails are rude and unprofessional .
horrid company run by the worst people you can possibly imagine .
disgusting .
if you do n't , find a different rental company .
their emails are rude and unprofessional .
they ultimately tried to steal our security deposit .
this rental management company is the absolute worst in madison .
if you can not serve everyone equally you should not be doing this .
bad bad customer service .
the woman would not even let me talk without hanging up .
that said , this place did n't do much for me .
it 's more empty space than it is art , it would seem .
only low : staff ignored us on all five times i 've been inside .
do n't feel welcome here .
but i do n't like it .
i do n't get the appeal , especially of their `` specialty '' slices .
i do n't even like this pizza when i 'm drunk .
this is not ny pizza .
its different , and if you have been drinking , it tastes better .
i even joked about this later and they did not find it funny .
but the slices just looked dry and not very cheesy at all .
however , photos can be deceptive , it 's the taste that matters .
this is not mac and cheese pizza so much as mac and dough pizza .
the bottom line is that i threw away about _num_ % of the slice .
i just do n't get all the positive reviews for this place .
in my opinion this is the worst pizza in madison .
was really disappointed in this joint .
it took _num_ mins for them to serve me _num_ slices of pepperoni pizza .
i 'm going to give this place another chance because the pizza was tasty .
as it stands currently , i would recommend glass nickel .
to get to review : shitty greasy cheese and ingredients , so so crust .
after going today , i realized that i 'm over this place .
if the brand seems like something popular or trendy , the price goes up .
as far as i know , banana republic is n't retro .
overall , it 's hard to find a good deal at st. vinny 's .
this is a thrift shop , not a consignment shop unless something has changed .
_num_ .
hire a service for that fish tank .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
sashimi tuna @ $ _num_ should not be served well .
_num_ .
oh yea , and it should n't have the consistency of jello pudding .
_num_ .
$ _num_ for a local brew is not ok .
_num_ .
figure out your french onion soup - it should be a staple .
i can not recommend .
_num_ stars only because i think there is potential in some of their dishes .
then , no soup spoon -- we had to ask for one .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the main reason we did n't eat there .
there was nobody in the restaurant .
no host , no customers , nobody .
_num_ .
yes , it literally fell from above onto a dresser .
horrific customer service and awful rental company .
they have an excuse for everything .
i would not even recommend parking in their lots .
there are never enough spaces .
avoid at all costs !
Neutral
i wish i could give them negative stars .
the worst customer service ever .
the woman wearing glasses is extremely unfriendly , impatient , and even rude .
regarding the apartment i lived , it was totally a disaster .
however , rent was cheap .
big mistake .
the move in day was a disaster .
worst experience ever .
they were quite filthy .
it was $ _num_ a month !
total rip off !
worst property management ever .
so i gave up trying .
three weeks passed and i did n't receive anything .
it 's a rip-off for a simple passport photo .
a pretty nasty little walgreens .
i ate about half of it and left hungry .
just overall an unpleasant experience .
i was extremely unimpressed with the service at octopus .
really , i expected it to be done nicely the first time .
i 'm so sad that i paid this much for what i received .
she apologized and then charge me another four dollars .
no further apology .
no further car washes .
i hate that they just do n't get it right from the start .
this is will not give you a good clean for your money .
really pretty terrible .
car wash .
this is not acceptable .
everyone looks unhappy .
screw this , there has got to be a better place .
they seem to be chosen for their ability to keep the owner company .
the books are often ridiculously overpriced .
she was more than willing to sell us a much more expensive gold band .
the moment was more than gone and , we left .
this is a scam used by jewelers to sell people more expensive jewelry .
apparently , this is not true .
the second time i was in trying to pick out a watch .
the owner was standing right there and offered nothing .
on the other hand , the room that i received could have been better .
the bathtub also did not drain properly .
i did not have a good feeling about the room .
the room had a musty odor .
the bed was lumpy .
the sheets did n't look white and pressed .
the bathroom was very outdated .
avoid this hotel if you can .
little do you know that light music is being heard next door !
it was terrible .
the other , slightly less obnoxious issue , was that it was cold !
last , small items , table leg was broken and no microwave or fridge .
for $ _num_ a night i think these should be addressed .
stayed in _num_ .
avoid !
the price was n't half bad for the location .
these are n't good enough for you ?
they squeezed me in , and rotated the tires too .
they are putting a new cover on , for free of course .
$ _num_ a night .
my internet does n't work in my room .
my tv remote is broken .
the elevator make me press the button with the force of _num_ tons .
i do n't have that much power !
warning , i 'm a bit of a `` hotel snob . ''
she was generally friendly , though .
no pool .
small building , that makes sense .
it 's outdated , they at least have a chance to fix that .
sorry , no deal .
recently i had a slow leak on my front tire .
it was initially flat when they put it on .
when i got home less than _num_ miles away the tire was flat .
very frustrating .
i did not really care for the manager .
the staff was friendly enough and the bed was comfy .
the bathroom was gross .
it was n't `` historical '' or `` antique '' .
it was old , the fixtures were cheap and it was generally disgusting .
it 's not worth the money , but the choices in madison are limited .
the decor in each room is old and just plain standard ... nothing special .
the appetizers consisted of quiche ( blech ) and raw vegetables .
i got tired of waiting and left .
gross !
that 's not a draw for me , i can watch tv at home .
, complete with shorts ( in february ) and backwards baseball caps .
and , the dessert was gone at 10pm .
the building itself , rooms , and furnishings are dated .
the complementary breakfast , snacks , and desserts are hit or miss .
everything was clean and the pool area was relaxing when there were no crowds .
Positive
if i could give this hotel negative stars , i certainly would .
two days later , i triple check online .
she never does .
a $ _num_ charge is posted to my account .
i hear nothing from her again .
she calls me back , leaves a voicemail .
i call her back , leave her a voicemail , no return call .
this is completely unacceptable !
how can you justify charging someone $ _num_ for your mistakes !
i stayed here for a conference in september and stayed in a concourse room .
the decor was incredibly dated , i 'm guessing _num_ 's ?
my room was no better .
ancient decor , funky smells .
the only nice thing was the size .
it was slow to respond and inconsistent with the temperature .
the shower was adequate but had low pressure .
the burger needed something , i just could n't place what it needed .
they told me _num_ minutes but it was delivered in less than _num_ .
booked a room a few weeks in advance of our trip through expedia .
cancelled my reservation after they did a bait and switch on the room rate .
personally i would n't recommend it for the price .
no bottled water in the room .
bathroom not clean enough .
no in room safe .
no newspaper as promised .
will pass on this hotel next time simply due to lack of business amenities .
my issue with the hotel was the cleanliness of my room .
the room was clean and well kept , the beds were comfortable .
worst _num_ $ i ever spent !
lots of selection in the gym , but very few channels in the room .
totally ridiculous method of keeping regular customers happy .
no reason to only include one floor of rooms for this benefit .
what a waste of money .
they do n't care about repeat customers , only first come first serve .
i was really disappointed with the service over the phone with rainbow .
long story short do n't shop at rainbow .
really , prices are pretty ridiculous for the food you 're getting .
why bother .
really why bother ?
almost too rich , but the texture of the ( pork ? )
i was disappointed with my mac n ' cheese .
this is not good food , people .
big mistake .
ick .
f my life .
i said , `` just bring me another '' and then never brought one .
was trying to make this difficult for me .
but i am never setting foot inside that restaurant again .
_num_ stars for the idea .
after that it was pretty much downhill .
the dining room was slow and the service was awful .
ordered the thai soup there was barely any broth .
the entire restaurant looked like it needed a really good cleaning .
avoid at all costs .
there was a line at the door only one cashier .
it looked like one was dealing with a previous complaint .
talk about a disaster .
there was even a dirty shirt on the sink counter ?
we then proceeded to get our sodas .
i had to go downstairs to get our drinks .
i wo n't be going back .
and you could see that they only had one register open .
i was wrong .
, obviously in a hurry to get his order and get gone .
no ricotta and too sparse a layer of cheese .
the garlic bread was soggy with butter and tasteless .
it 's amazing how poor the restaurants on state street can be .
i wish there was a way to give less than a _num_ star review .
my husband ordered an italian sausage sub .
there was no sauce on the sandwich .
the eggplant was not breaded or fried .
no cheese .
they were so salty that they were inedible .
the sauce was passable but why bother ?
it 's hard to find good italian food in madison .
so disappointing .
it would take a total overhaul to get me back into this restaurant .
do not buy the house red wine .
really disappointing food .
it did n't even come with pasta .
we only drank water , but the meal still cost $ _num_ .
ridiculous for a basic chicken dish and an old salad .
will not go back .
the service was slow , slow , slow .
it was literally dripping off the noodles .
what 's worse is that the sauce was way too salty and almost inedible .
my mother-in-law got the chicken parm .
it was just a sad piece of chicken on a plate .
i 'm guessing it was frozen at some point , like the chicken parm .
i 'm sad this place is going out in such a bad note .
the first time was fine - not particularly good , not particularly bad .
however , when i went to use the voucher , things only got worse .
obviously i refused .
the district manager did not answer , and never returned my call .
stay away from jiffy lube !
not your fault .
i had a very disappointing experience today at jiffy lube .
i did n't want to say anything since they seemed pretty busy .
i looked up and realized it had been over an hour .
she said it would just be about _num_ more minutes .
it was maybe another _num_ .
no one even acknowledged the inconvenience of the wait .
she also let me use a $ _num_ coupon .
went for lunch - service was slow .
waitress was n't especially friendly , but was n't rude either .
no no no no no .
awkward .
the perch was disgusting ; chewy and fishy and tough .
it did n't taste like fresh perch .
fries were boring .
coleslaw was too vinegary .
sourdough roll was too frozen .
tartar sauce was all mayonnaise .
because half of madison is there every friday night .
they wo n't be hurting for business any time soon .
crowded , poor service and fish can either be so-so or very bad .
it 's decent but too costly for the quality .
the place always seems crowded .
this layout has been mentioned in other reviews as well .
as far as the food goods , i wo n't go back .
i was n't impressed by the fish fry .
i 've been here a few times .
almost , if there is such a thing , too strong .
hot , gooey , greasy .
- cheese soup + chunky tomato soup = delicious bowl of soup .
- our second order of cheese curds .
and were rather cold .
lousy steak .
greasy potatoes .
my friday night at avenue bar was one to remember .
thank god basketball was on tv or we might have fallen asleep waiting .
other servers were not .
i sent the fried perch back in hopes of getting something hot .
the verdict : not so great .
been to a bar/restaurant before ?
no frills menu , meh service , that 's about all i got .
never did get to taste the food .
is n't _num_ minutes enough to get dinner ?
unbelievable that any establishment could get by with that behavior .
old wisconsin supper club .
not really sure i 'll be going back any time soon .
very greasy fish and mushy fries .
for $ _num_ and _num_ small pieces of cod it was way over rated .
the food is very mediocre .
the friday night fish fry was way overpriced and nothing special .
for $ _num_ a plate i 'd expect more quality and/or quantity .
i was very dissapointed with the avenue bar .
the dinner was a waste of money .
unfortunately we will not go back .
very disappointed in the customer service attitude of the staff .
stopped in to have drinks with friends and the bar area was very cold .
tomato soup was great , calamari was thinly breaded and with a great sauce .
we did n't have a reservation and had to wait , which is fine .
it was very difficult to get a drink while we waited .
you know , normally , i would rate this place higher .
it was just today , it seemed off .
toast was not toasted , but the wheat bread was good .
the prices went up portions down .
it was boiled cod .
the worst i 've ever had .
it was awful !
dry and bland .
really a disappointment .
i gave _num_ stars for the server and her attentiveness .
_num_ thing i did like was additional booths and less crowded table seating .
service was slow for being not too busy on a friday night .
the slowest pizza delivery company !
horribly slow , even if you order _num_ hours in advance .
extremely arrogant on the phone .
avoid if you can !
extremely rude and unhelpful employee , both over the phone and in person .
i would not reccomend this to anyone for any occasion .
unfortunately johnny d 's has gone downhill .
however , i went there last friday and it has gone completely downhill .
it 's really a shame considering we had been loyal customers for years .
the garlic mashed potatoes were watery .
what a disappointment .
our waitress never stopped by our table to ask us how our food was .
she could have cared less .
what a lousy way to celebrate a birthday dinner .
like i said we wo n't be going back .
i ordered the lamb shank special which was tough and barely warm .
we get seated closer to _num_ pm .
and the dining room is still not that busy .
more waiting , appetizers arrive .
more waiting and _num_ rounds of bread baskets later .
minutes later , our entres arrive .
i will not be returning anytime soon , restaurant week or otherwise .
ok , finally made it here ... sure wo n't rush back .
others loved their steaks ... mine was flavorless .
)
my steak was over cooked and dry .
when we brought concerns to his attention he immediately tried to make things right .
they were dry , tasteless and cold .
the hashbrowns were also cold .
the chocolate cake was unremarkable .
i know i am not only person that misses firefly .
skip it .
the meat was tough and not very flavorful .
on a recent business dinner the food was terrible !
we started with crab cakes that were bland .
the steakhouse salad was the best thing i ate all night .
i ordered the petite filet with a blue cheese crust with the garlic mash .
really , for lunch ?
instead , he gets a cheeseburger with some lettuce .
wrong !
no flavor , absolutely no flavor .
overall , an incredibly disappointing experience all around .
service was friendly but bad .
the scallops were cold and under cooked .
my steak was charred a bit much , inside done properly .
selected this place to celebrate 40th birthday with a group of friends .
the selection of quality beers is extremely limited .
the service was horrible .
this place was boring _num_ years ago , and it 's still boring .
was informed that they only come in black and stout ( almost black ) .
which sucks by the way .
save your money , and go to chicago for good shows .
did n't madison already have a perfectly fine civic center ?
overall , i really do n't see the point of this building .
not a good place to see live music .
bad seats are expensive , close seats are very expensive .
this just is n't anything i 'm looking for in a music venue .
i want a more intimate setting with beer and reasonable ticket prices .
i 'd take a dumpy old theater over this place any day .
has the ambience of a cheap bar .
not really my thing .
the one thing that ruined this place was the outrageous prices !
as she walked away .
wo n't be coming back .
the food was only mediocre and the service was bad .
i was n't especially impressed by the atmosphere .
anyway , last time we were there , it was below zero outside .
_num_ that is freaking rude to say to a customer .
until he is gone , i will never set foot in that place again .
no customers should be treated this way .
sure , it 's not my favorite bar in madison .
it 's not even in my top _num_ .
they have raised their prices , but not the quality .
that 's reasonable , is n't it ?
first off , the host was welcoming and fast , and the waitress rocked .
she even took care of the bill quickly and kept waters refilled .
convenient for the line cooks , not so much for your belly .
you 're cheap , but not cheap enough for this greasy fare .
fun atmosphere , bad coffee , greasy food .
worst .
some are very nice but inept .
some are terribly rude .
i visit here nearly weekly with a group .
none of that matters much right ?
well it would n't if the food was superb .
the place is mediocre at best .
the first time i visited here i ordered the walleye with toast .
my over easy eggs were simply just gross .
they were really watery and completely inedible .
i ordered them with the walleye ( again ) , along with the potatoes .
i do n't like this place and i def will not be back .
once or twice a year i tell myself to try this place again .
i do n't solely blame the servers , some of them are great .
example : two weeks ago ... i arrived at 5pm to play volleyball .
terrible bar service due to lack of staffing .
the focaccia has even been replaced with rye bread .
the bread is okay , but it 's no where close to comparable .
and i miss it .
annoying .
more importantly , the food was highly disappointing .
the bread was served with some `` duck fat '' dipping sauce .
why would you serve duck fat ?
probably never going there again .
pick off most of the veggies to make them passable .
espresso royale sucks .
the coffee and tea here is not exceptional , but not bad either .
_num_ ) there are no tables for more than two people !
_num_ ) the internet is crappy .
not all that fresh .
fail .
both were bad .
this coffee is absolute shit .
once upon a time , this was one of my favorite coffee shops .
you walk in and the baristas stare at you like you 're an inconvenience .
sorry guys , i need my caffeine fix .
too bad the espresso tastes watered down and stale .
the bakery is overpriced and ( again ) stale .
tables are cramped and the wi-fi is terrible .
i 've never been very impressed .
i was really dissapointed by espresso royale .
i had what was hands down the worst hot chocolate i have ever had .
it did n't even taste like chocolate .
it was really light too .
it tasted like nothing .
my boyfriend 's latte was mediocre at best .
they 've slowly declined over the years and have finally hit bottom .
it 's like they simply stopped caring .
atmosphere : bland and corporate .
while everything is relatively clean , it completely lacks character .
that is where i think espresso royale falls way short .
she never smiles or says hello .
usually a short `` what would you like ? ''
i 've tried to brush it off , but it 's irritating !
rip-off !
walls and furniture were in rough shape .
staff was competent , but was not enthusiastic .
they should have had more staff , instead of one person in the morning .
we were in a group of five and the experience was inconsistent .
i do n't understand why people think this place is so amazing ?
maybe i 'm just missing the boat here .
very awkward .
and no , i do n't think it was olive oil .
the bread was not noticeably different from subway 's .
first of all , the service was terrible .
i did n't even get an apology for the wait .
pathetic .
in september i received _num_ worth of merchandise i never ordered .
not true .
the better business bureau should look into this scam .
oddly shaped , poor acoustics , just ill suited for their purpose .
the food was n't really all of that either .
it was a nice setting , but the band was horrible .
unfortunately , the food was n't as amazing as the view .
the meal was a filet and chicken breast with roasted potatoes .
the potatoes were n't even that good .
i could n't believe what i was seeing .
all of this for $ _num_ per person plus tax and tip .
oh wait , i know !
moving on to the wrap made things even worse .
if you do n't want to be here , why should i ?
i could 've made a better product at home for under half the price .
are you kidding me ?
_num_ stars because the place at least looked ok .
other times the service is surly and unpleasant .
better sushi in other places in madison .
i was very disappointed in this restaurant .
sadly the food is very bland , the sushi is not fresh at all .
worst sushi experience of my life !
this last time was horrific .
poor food and poor service !
i 'm never coming back again .
their service never disappoints .
worst fish we 've ever eaten .
the sashimi tastes like its b quality from the supermarket .
i say try because we walked out after waiting _num_ minutes for our food .
horrible service .
after a couple of minutes a waiter was flagged down and seated us .
not okay .
everything runs through your mind , what else did they eat ?
i immediately felt sick and flagged down our waitress , mia .
i love sushi and tar tar , so raw is not a problem .
more importantly the philly roll i ordered was horrible .
the spider roll was sloppy .
delivery took an hour and _num_ minutes tonight .
horrible delivery service .
waited almost _num_ hours for my order .
oh , and the food , at best , was mediocre .
all in all , do n't order delivery .
all we cared about was not getting food poisoning .
so overall , never would i go to this place again !
i might return to this place if it was half that price .
i just had sashimi which was very underwhelming .
have had much better elsewhere .
it 's by no means a japanese restaurant .
the only thing i think real is the instant miso soup .
i am so disappointed by it .
they get _num_ stars for sushi , i do not recommend .
the service was slow - real slow .
if you are going to do the hibachi get steak or chicken .
but getting water refills or even a couple of forks was an ordeal .
the wait staff was was nice enough , but entirely overwhelmed .
i thought this could n't be too bad .
i ordered a teriyaki chicken , one of my favorite signature japanese dish .
i have never had really bad japanese food before .
despite the reasonable price and wide selections , i would not recommend this place .
maybe it 's just time to look for a new sushi place.
worst service ever .
will not come back .
just ridiculous .
the service was terrible !
the service at times is surly and confusing .
otherwise there is n't anything very exciting about pizza di roma .
the next few days i spent trying to get over the food poisoning .
pizza di roma is terrible .
their appetizers and entrees are pretty bad too .
terrible , awful sandwiches .
seriously gross .
the pizza looks tasty ( but looks can be deceiving ) .
the sub was alright , not bad , but nothing great .
what i received was such a disappointment .
like i said , covered in cheese , i could hardly find the pasta .
do not go for lunch ; this is not that kind of pizza place .
sick .
plus the food is kind of gross anyway .
i 'd like to begin by saying that the food was pretty good .
the delivery driver was offensive and challenged .
his poor attitude was the worst part .
the tiramisu was a bit dry , but was still tasty .
i 'm not sure i can try the place again .
just finished having my pizza and caesar salad which i had delivered .
my pizza slice was extremely soggy .
i ordered the supreme which had veggies , sausage , and pepperoni .
my caesar salad was just as bad .
the dressing was very thin and watery .
would not recommend .
the other problem was the size of the tomato cuts .
he threw out his chicken linguine .
i told him at this point that this wait time was ridiculous .
gross .
i decide i 'm getting my $ _num_ back .
never have i had such a horrible experience .
small business owner was incredibly rude .
how do you rate zero stars ?
very disappointing .
so rude with the response too .
went here and got two specialty slices : chicken parm and caprese .
the chicken parm was mostly flavorless and the caprese was completely flavorless .
ended up being the biggest waste of calories i think i 've ever experienced .
pizza is great but the staff is horrible .
it was disgusting and unfortunately i will not return because of this .
what a lame place .
check it out for yourself , though .
i did n't come away too impressed .
no such luck .
we walked left .
gross .
it 's ugly , it should n't be made in the first place .
i 've gotten impatient condescending vibes from some of the salespeople .
i really ca n't stand when people talk to me like that .
$ _num_ for only two chorizo tacos ?
the black beans were bland , the rice forgettable .
i 've been to this place one time and we were not impressed .
sunday brunch , _num_ people , 11am .
restaurant was busy , but there was no wait for a table .
onto the service ... our waiter was an embarrassment .
* our waiter neglected to fill our water and coffee throughout our visit .
somehow none of the other waitstaff noticed us either .
while the food was presented nicely , i was not impressed with my burrito .
although my margarita did make up some for my disappointment in the food .
disgusting .
by the way , the margaritas were weak .
again , to make up for service , waitress brought by expired drink coupons .
the service is slow and disappointing .
the guacamole came out fast , but the chips took _num_ minutes .
horrible service .
would not go back .
this makes no sense to me at all .
i tasted not one mushroom and it was loaded with too much spice .
rice and black beans that came with it was n't good .
our server did n't miss a beat handling our demanding party of _num_ .
that being said , i would not be returning .
food just was n't good .
although fine , the food did not make up for the poor service .
there are a lot of tastier and friendlier options for mexican food in madison .
( seafood enchilada was similarly terrible , and expensive ) .
beans were bland and rice overcooked .
overall , the dinner took _num_ painful hours .
their chicken enchiladas are disgusting .
the rice is too watery , mushy and needs more flavor .
over priced , food was less than fair tasting .
sorry i do n't buy into free chips and salsa .
however i have n't found many friendly tellers there .
i wanted to like it , but the truth is i was very disappointed .
the food was not great , especially for the prices !
gross .
i still think you 're cute , but i 'm not coming back .
first time , my eggs were way overcooked .
but we left the restaurant very disappointed .
seriously disappointing .
service was unfriendly and the vibe of the place was hostile .
one of the worst meals i 've had in madison .
shame !
shame !
shame ! ''
and i will not be patronizing their business anymore .
me : `` oh , that 's terrible . ''
he refunded the money , but was n't apologetic .
some of their better ones are marked up a bit too high .
tasting room has them for about _num_ .
terrible customer service .
the staff seemed cordial though a bit distracted and not particularly helpful .
hopefully sales staff will be better informed .
so i can only assume katie thinks i 'm lying .
how frustrating .
sorry to say , i 've had better pedicures .
i wo n't get a pedicure here again .
so instead i ordered a hot tea .
party of _num_ , me and my husband .
one clam chowder soup , appetizers and crab legs .
otherwise , choose another seafood place .
so , i had heard great things about ocean grill .
we should have been tipped off by the fact that it was empty .
not a good sign .
maybe we should have just stuck with those ?
i thought the menu was boring and very limited .
talk about snooty .
guess they have to pay that capitol square rent somehow .
we would n't go back and would not recommend it .
very , very poor .
seriously , run away from this place .
Negative
i 'm just sorry that i ca n't give it a negative star rating .
the chicken was n't well trimmed , and the pasta was nothing special .
i 'll skip it in the future .
i tried this place after it was suggested by a local .
this place was just gross .
this is also why i went back several times .
not only have i experienced better , i 've made better .
my bad for not saying ice , i guess .
_num_ more who had pasta said theirs was bland as well .
what i do fault them for is the atmosphere .
certainly among the very worst service experiences i 've had in madison .
it took me _num_ minutes to flag down wait staff to point this out .
the restaurant is usually quite cramped , and this leads to discomfort .
perhaps the worst thing about the location is the restrooms .
absolutely no seasoning or flavor on the sauces .
and we were so , so disappointed in our experience .
was an overall drag of an experience .
we were disappointed .
our meal was disgusting !
entrees this bad for $ _num_ ?
nice enough people , but they clearly do n't care about food or customers .
for starters , my dish had way too much lemon juice .
the citrus was bad and it did not go well with the goat cheese .
the portion size was n't worth that price i paid .
the first stop he made was to the window to pick up an order .
i was disgusted .
thank goodness it was no my order .
the tables are too close together and the chairs are old .
on a final not , i asked if they had wifi .
this food is not italian .
the pasta was fine .
the calamari was tasteless .
too bad .
from the exterior , the place does n't look bad .
but the food was only subpar .
the side salad was full of mostly spoiled vegetables and smelled awful .
would not eat here again there are so many other options .
service : in a word , slow .
this time , however , my party of _num_ was extremely disappointed .
bartender ignored us .
he said he would send someone over and was so sorry for the wait .
all we ordered were _num_ pomegranate martinis .
you could tell he was not happy .
so he left to get our drinks .
this happened over and over and over again for _num_ minutes or more .
i am sound sensitive and it was getting me on edge .
the manager apologized and said it was not acceptable .
clearly the management had n't to this point .
i do n't trust that anything will change at this restaurant .
if they 're hiring people like him , then something is wrong .
for the price , the foods just not worth it .
but the last few times i 've gone i 've been disappointed .
last night my boyfriend and i went and it was very busy .
the food was n't terrible but it was n't anything special .
had dinner there tonight .
terrible .
the bread was hard and cold .
the waiter was not attentive at all .
i would not recommend this resturant .
ok so _num_ % sure they forgot to put in my tables order .
great coffee but the service in the afternoon is poor .
my other major complaint is that the wireless rarely works .
this starbucks is always freezing cold in the summer , uncomfortable .
and the wifi did not work well .
however , rude service .
rude .
rude .
rude .
i 'm glad i did n't immediately leave a tip because they get none .
the latte was better than expected .
the muffin , however , was terrible .
service was pretty slow considering how empty it was .
on saturday night , however , there was a band playing .
our room shook it was so loud .
beyond the volume , the internet is slow .
you will also constantly hear cars , buses , trucks .
for you , maybe this just is n't an issue .
the room that my boyfriend and i stayed in was not clean .
also , one of the windows in our room did not have a screen .
i do n't know why , but this bothered me a lot .
i know other rooms had fans , but ours did not .
it 's not even worth $ _num_ a night .
venue needs to be cleaner .
only sheets are replaced per person per stay .
no visible ac , so do n't stay here in the summer .
i went in with a rear flat .
my husband spent $ _num_ on a bike outfit from this store .
do n't bother shopping here .
the cashiers just seemed lazy and bored .
a severe rip off !
chin 's fails in all three areas .
i ordered the pad thai with chicken .
the chicken tasted like it was previously cooked or just not good quality chicken .
the noodles were just drenched in soy sauce or something like it .
pad thai = chow mein , the chicken dishes are bland .
if you 're going to get something get the stir fries .
if you get anything else , you 're wasting your money .
i 'm not saying this because `` it 's not authentic asian ! ''
service was rough and slow for the product .
very disappointing , the concept could be an eastern version of noodles and company .
Neutral
first big negative - who runs out of sausage ?
only problem is that is all i tasted .
the orange taste was so overpowering that nothing else came through .
pretty expensive though - for a breakfast - and portions were not large .
i might - but i 'm not in a hurry to return .
so why such a low rating ?
i really hated the set up .
i felt very rushed the entire time i was there .
i felt as though i had _num_ seconds to look at the menu .
now - about the people waiting for tables - i am eating my breakfast .
overall , it was just very odd .
kind of like a deli , but it 's not super cheap .
for a leisurely breakfast , i 'd suggest you look elsewhere .
ambiance : well it has the typical too trendy look to it .
the seats and stools are uncomfortable , but look nice .
short hair , attitude , matching t-shirts , probably pit hair .
hate that .
you do n't go to this place for the food .
my brioche french toast was cold and not even slightly flavorful .
just gross .
had i not been starving it would 've been sent back .
for like at least a half hour there was no coffee in the joint .
better luck for the next guy !
not kid friendly food .
potatoes are not good .
this is my first time in madison and my first restaurant we visited .
i felt more like an inconvenience then a customer .
marigold kitchen ... you should be ashamed .
i would recommend mcdonald 's before marigold kitchen .
i will not be returning .
tea water lukewarm .
noisy .
our experience was not a good one and we will not be returning .
marigold 's potatoes and pancakes are out of this world .
chaotic and poor service ... .
cashier was rude and unhelpful .
great food or not wo n't be returning .
i am not sure what all these people think is so good .
complete chaos as soon as you walk in the door .
everything is so old and dirty ... then the food comes out .
the food presentation is awful ... sloppy , no color and down right unpleasant .
no thanks not again .
tried the zucchini pancakes and they were good experience was awful .
very disappointing place .
previous visits have been worth more like _num_ stars , but not today .
if you are seeking quantity and not quality marigold should be consideration .
potatoes were burned to a crisp and eggs were not cooked fully .
very disappointed by their treatment and disregard for customers .
i dine here regularly and never will go again after today .
i talked to the manager and he did nothing about it .
if you want a terrible dining experience go here .
otherwise , avoid at all cost .
so disappointed , especially since my firm is a regular customer .
i ordered a side of marigold potatoes because the quiche only came with greens .
the handsome man i was with ordered the duck confit hash .
only the potatoes were tasty .
my quiche was bland , even the sausage had minimal flavor .
the crust was overly dense and chewy , not at all flaky .
the duck confit hash looked greasy and disgusting .
the hash only came with greens , no toast .
toast was an extra $ _num_ .
it was horrible and he did n't even finish half .
we were very disappointed especially after spending over $ _num_ on breakfast .
bacon was soggy and portions were small .
unfortunately , our favorite spot was closed because it was monday .
would not recommend !
was excited to try this place .
it was not great , though .
the white of the egg was not even done .
disgusting .
we also got a short stack of blueberry pancakes .
way too expensive for what we got .
came here because of the great reviews and as totally disappointed !
sadly the monkey bar went down hill the past couple years .
before this change i had no trouble getting there _num_ mornings a week .
it does n't open early enough and their food selection is dismal .
sorry but i think you can do much much better in madison .
so , i suggest going elsewhere , really .
not so much .
which , attitude aside , just makes everything take longer .
more importantly , they are n't particularly good with their espresso drinks .
sigh , so many inexperienced pizza eaters here .
really , 4-5 stars ?
this is crap pizza by chicago standards .
quite frankly , i do n't get the hype .
glass nickel , though ?
the crust is me , too chewy and without taste .
there , i feel better , i needed to get that off my chest .
it 's all chew and no crunch .
their pies could use more sauce to balance out all that bland crust .
i have never been so sick or in so much pain in my life .
the meal today at this university rd branch was very disappointing .
zero organization .
the owner is extremely rude during my few visits to their shop .
they did not greet , nor did they say anything when we pay them .
he treated me as if i owed them money !
i stopped going to this place after the unpleasant experience .
if you want to shop for korean food , go to park st .
Negative
i had a negative experience with the owner this afternoon .
he was quite rude and refused to move .
it 's the only place in town that carries them .
i was not greeted when i check out either .
that is unfriendly and even rude .
throughout my entire visit he did not say a single thing to me .
stay away - expensive and awful customer service !
shirts cost at least $ _num_ more per shirt than they should cost .
however , the prices are outrageous .
my suit was not cleaned completely .
but they do n't have a solution for it .
and the employee ( a guy ) 's attitude was rude .
rude , expensive and horrible cleaning !
but the customer service is the worst thing in the world .
then he will go out of his way to charge more than he should .
he 's the worst to everyone .
i could walk there faster than that .
their `` subs so fast you 'll freak '' motto is a joke .
if i could give this location less than one star , i would .
however , this location has pretty slow service .
makes me wonder if its new staff on training ?
lousy service .
every time i felt that things could not get worse today , it did !
so far , not a good start !
nice ghetto touch , and no tip for you !
it does n't end there .
i can not imagine why i would ever put myself through this again .
do not ever consider ordering anything from jimmy johns and their crew of clowns !
here 's an update on my disaster from saturday !
jimmy john 's representative contacted me earlier today !
every time i felt that things could not get worse today , it did !
so far , not a good start !
nice ghetto touch , and no tip for you !
it does n't end there .
i can not imagine why i would ever put myself through this again .
do not ever consider ordering anything from jimmy johns and their crew of clowns !
she told me she had no lunch at all when she arrived home .
this was in _num_ .
i 've not gone back since .
no apology .
another hour goes by , no sub .
this store has absolute worst service .
i ordered from there and _num_ minutes later , there was nothing .
maybe i 'd give this place _num_ stars if i could .
the options on the menu are somewhat limited .
it seems like you have to order everything separately here .
it should be more like $ $ for price .
like clay p who posted before me , i too love pancakes .
this was our first and only visit .
we could not finish our food the taste was terrible .
some of our food was cold .
i do not recommend this place .
really disappointing .
i wo n't be back .
it was a disappointing experience .
tables that were seated long after us were served first .
the food was definitely not worth the wait or price .
very disappointing !
i wo n't be back .
normally , it 's a _num_ or _num_ star place .
however , this morning , it disappointed me .
we thought it might not be that bad , but we were wrong .
the only thing she said was : did your waitress tell you ?
believe it or not , some people really like it !
which was unnecessary and rude in my opinion .
so i decided to get the potato pancakes which was a bad choice .
there are better places to get breakfast in madison .
_num_ minute wait on a saturday morning ?
`` server '' : no , we do n't do that .
pathetic .
it looks just like a long branch with a tiny crown on top .
i will not be going back .
they had plenty of blue but nothing worked for me .
i had already been around the store twice looking at the fabric .
i asked for a receipt and they could n't produce one .
be warned : they claim they neither have a computer nor a fax machine .
sketchy .
they all turn to look , but no one actually greets you .
very unprofessional !
horrible experience with mike on more than one occasion .
horrible !
horrible !
horrible !
you have no pity at all .
_num_ stars .
awesome beer but veggie burger tastes nasty .
_num_ of _num_ stars .
ill be back then !
burger is ok but definitely not worth the hype .
the whole place could use an update .
bad cheese curds mediocre burgers .
bad cheese curds mediocre burgers .
a little disappointed here !
i should have taken a pic of the sandwich .
the `` bun '' was tasteless and overall sandwich was terrible .
the meat is really not that special given the high prices .
and like another reviewer ; where is the `` local '' provider ?
is it too much to ask for something other than black , or brown ?
on january 5th i dropped off _num_ vintage watches to have the bands changed .
no complicated repairs ... just bands .
i guess i should be grateful they did n't lose the watch .
but losing the original box is careless and sloppy .
i 'm a small business owner and really support other small businesses .
Negative
i am not happy about writing a negative review .
poor quality food , bad service , high price , filthy bathrooms .
have i mentioned its not worth the price ?
go elsewhere for a steak experience .
i have to say , i do n't get it .
and table salt and table pepper ?
i wo n't be coming back .
so my fault there .
the tenderloin was about an inch thick and maybe five ounces .
the hash browns were the biggest disappointment though .
the edge and part of the bottom was charred ( way beyond crispy ! )
i have to say it was a big disappointment !
i ordered the lobster tail with baked potato with a dinner salad .
gross !
we wo n't be going back .
it is impossible to imagine how this place is still in business .
possible my biggest dining disappointment ever .
she stated she was `` sorry for the communication error '' and did nothing .
the meat was not seasoned and was bland .
it all went wrong once we got to our table .
the waiter was horrible !
just nothing but a jerk and not helpful .
when i ordered there was a choice between broiled and fried walleye .
anyway , the steak needed salt !
i 've never seasoned a steak at those prices before ... never !
the walleye , fried , was pretty awesome though .
if you go , check those things out .
otherwise , do n't waste your time .
it sad , too .
this was our first and probably last visit to smoky 's .
drinks were good but very pricy .
relish , soup and tomato juice with lemon were the highlights tonight .
the onion ring appetizer was also flavorless .
hard to make onions flavorless but they were .
also very bland and greasy .
my husband 's prime rib was mostly fat .
gross .
a very mediocre dinner earlier this evening .
a very poor way to start an evening .
the evening was not much better after that .
service was slow .
the bread in the basket was stale and hard .
just not a good piece of meat to start with .
there was nothing that would make me want to return .
smoky 's is the most over rated steak house in madison .
no thanks .
my friend had perch so bad could not eat it .
waiter response , same perch as we always serve .
my walleye was tasteless .
the store manager was also rude and never even apologized !
caution ... read all the paperwork they give you .
guy was rude and had zero patience !
just went in to buy a single cable and it took almost _num_ minutes .
not only this but they immediately blamed it on their internet provider .
do n't bring you car here !
in my mind , that 's not how you run a business .
so i will be taking my business elsewhere .
_num_ days ago schedule appointment online for 7:30 a.m. for oil change .
i got here at 7:30 a.m. , waited for _num_ minutes in line .
never had any problems before .
i picked up my truck and quickly drove off to another appointment .
low and behold the driver 's side window does n't work .
this was not mentioned to me when i picked up the truck .
i find it unethical and dishonest .
unfortunately i had to quit shopping here because they 're not entirely honest .
but they got greedy .
the staff totally sucks .
like , omg , do n't live here .
its not worth it .
weeks later , we get a bill to have the carpet replaced .
the staff at this whole foods is unprofessional .
and the prepared food is typically awful .
the mac & cheese is watery .
ick .
i do n't know what happened , but quality control has gone downhill .
not a place i 'll frequent anymore .
except maybe for the chocolate chip cookies .
i 'm not a big fan .
so if you have a rubber allergy - do not eat their rotisserie chicken .
_num_ .
anyone who gives this place more than mediocre review is asleep .
nothing has changed .
oh well , not worth returning for the contest .
it was flat out terrible .
their bathroom is disgusting !
they do not clean it during the day and it shows !
also , i have seen some really unsanitary things happen behind their deli counter .
they seem to not want to deal with customers .
disappointing .
i will not be back .
i said no .
i could not see over to the other side , so i moved there .
could i check out in peace ?
giving me misleading information , and b .
what is this mess ?
no one seemed to notice or care .
every time i come to this location , the service is crappy to non-existent .
i avoid this location at all times .
no way to opt out if it 's taking entirely too long .
worth mentioning because it takes entirely too long .
cheap , tasty , and vegetarian options .
the worst experience at a spa ever .
the haircut was good but the coloring was awful .
my stylist also was not good at placing the highlights .
will not be returning .
wholeheartedly agree about the extremely poor service at this location .
then i 'm running late somewhere and stop .
a few mornings ago i walk in .
she says she does , but she needs a dozen bagels as well .
by the time he finally took my order , she had already paid .
however , this same employee has been terrible before .
there is no excuse for that kind of shockingly bad service .
and you should n't go there either .
what a crappy , crappy business .
the positive reviews for this place are entirely misleading .
this is in no way authentic chinese food .
very disappointed in takeout dinners this evening .
chicken in the curry chicken fried rice was undercooked .
d o n o t g o h e r e !
they fixed the problem , but charged me for the fix .
needless to say , i was n't thrilled .
and our service just sucked .
nothing like sitting with water and three rounds of pita for _num_ minutes .
we asked _num_ different people for the wine , including the waitress .
it was appalling .
my wife had gone in on another occasion to surprise me with some parts .
the service was wicked slow .
anyway -- totally weird service .
honesty , it was terrible .
my food was n't anything i could n't make myself at home .
i wore my jacket at the dinner table for the night .
i would not recommend this place to a friend .
our group of _num_ arrived on time for our reservation .
unbelievable .
no customer service skills .
too bad .
we were expecting a thin , crisp crust with almost sparse toppings .
( we probably should have inquired , but we did n't . )
i did not receive a call back .
that was unacceptable to me and my group and i went elsewhere .
but the attitude was `` sorry '' and that was basically it .
no big deal - i 'm here for the food .
after taking our orders i never saw our waiter again .
like lasagna with your salt , or pizza with your salt ?
the food was great but the service was awful .
really disappointing .
do n't reserve your table online .
horrible food !
even with that said this food , we could n't eat !
go elsewhere do not waste your time eating here .
i do n't understand the hype about this place .
the server then told me she fixed it so it was ok.
no apology .
maybe it was just an error .
my palate is n't that sophisticated , i guess .
other than the issues mentioned , the experience was pretty pleasant .
wow , i was kinda disappointed with this place .
i did n't think it was hard to mess up sauces with coconut milk .
we ordered : the potstickers ( steamed ) they were fine .
hubby , curry duck .
the squash and thai eggplant in my squash curry was n't ripe .
my dish was n't spicy at all .
bad service , mediocre food at best .
-- do n't chase me down to my car , your manager ( ? )
i know you can do better .
because of that i thought i hated thai food .
it was n't thai food 's fault .
more importantly , the sanitary standards must be raised here !
i requested to have rice with this instead .
they were apologetic and offered to redo the order .
i eat take out from this place every week because someone else treats me .
it gets worse every week .
and yes , there are an atrocious number of flies in the restaurant .
the waiting 's not over .
it was beyond ridiculous how inattentive she was .
a lot of dishes are almost flavorless .
like others have mentioned their curries are almost embarrassing .
i simply feel like there are far better thai food restaurants in madison .
too much sauce and it was too sweet both times .
however , one meal out of _num_ is not what i 'm looking for .
the waiter came to apologize after a full _num_ mins .
_num_ mins ?
he did n't think i might have been hungry a whole _num_ mins ago ?
waited _num_ hour _num_ minutes and eventually cancelled the order .
the guy on the phone did n't even apologize .
i 've eaten here before and the food is average .
but over time their dishes became more and more underwhelming .
a customer should never experience that .
overpriced and really not great .
but the service was horrible .
just awful .
ginger beef , the friday night special , tasted even worse .
service slow too .
i was disappointed in my food tonight .
the pad thai is not good here .
no thank you .
the takeout estimates were also way off .
horrible service .
do not order delivery from this restaurant .
usually , it 's pretty decent , but this past visit was not .
the booth seating gets rather uncomfortable after about _num_ minutes .
the lighting is odd and at times makes it difficult to read the menu .
there are plenty of other thai options in and around madison .
last visit here left much to be desired .
the place was far from full and i have had better pad thai s .
i thought the chicken coconut soup should be more savory .
the pad thai , being so common , was not better than somewhere cheaper .
but time and time again , i keep coming home disappointed .
i am just surprised how bad the dishes are becoming at this place .
this is really not a good thai restaurant .
their dishes are severely lacking in vegetables , freshness , and flavor .
so maybe i do n't have the taste for this .
really really cold bibimbap .
do not eat here .
also , all chinese people , just dont go there .
chinese food tastes way better than the korean food in madison .
go chicago for better korean food and higher serving quality .
this place is not very good .
they only gave us three side dishes and they were not great .
kimchi pancake was not good at all .
the tofu soup that i ordered was ... lacking , to say the least .
not what i 'm used to , but still acceptable .
the banchan was below average as well .
the portions are large and it comes served with a side of miso soup .
why only _num_ stars ?
because the front office staff has an attitude problem .
awful experience - careless , incompetent , and expensive - stay away !
just had an awful _num_ week experience with spring harbor animal hospital .
the wound closed up but never healed .
at this point we were quite frustrated , because he treatment had not worked .
it already is about _num_ % better !
no luck so i sat down .
then a salesperson approached -- and asked me to move !
only when i left did a salesperson shout after me .
i left with three pairs of shoes and spent $ _num_ .
the salesperson i had today was so rude .
i genuinely hate this store .
we had a horrible experience at the store .
i do n't know what happened , but we will never be returning .
then we noticed the sign that said open _num_ hours .
it was me and two groups of _num_ people .
service seemed a bit slow for the small crowd of customers .
it was that bad !
our sever was horrible and lacked people skills .
it was ridiculous !
and i would not recommend anyone to go there !
over all horrible !
really slow service ... .
it 's not like they were busy and the staff was overworked .
Negative
i wish i could give a negative rating !
this place i would not recommend ever .
the service was extremely slow for an almost - empty restaurant .
we should 've just went to a drive-thru and called it a night !
this place has typical greasy , heavy , diner food .
useless .
the drive-through staffs are unbelievably stupid .
this location does n't get that concept .
it 's beyond bad .
avoid at all costs !
i purchased a groupon for a shellac manicure .
my experience was terrible although the woman doing my nails was very friendly .
she did n't even file my nails .
i would give this walgreens zero stars if possible .
that said -- it was cheap .
what i got : plain bone wings .
i 've had better pizza at chuck e cheese 's .
but will never make this mistake again !
the lady explained to me that the insurance system is `` confusing . ''
as one of the previous reviews stated , this noodles and co is dirty .
i stopped in during non peak hours on a thursday ( 2:30 ) .
they did n't seem understaffed and there was n't a rush of customers .
i am not sure why tables could n't be cleaned during this time .
my food was n't good .
i ate it because i was hungry and went without lunch for the day .
that should have been my first sign to leave .
i do n't believe i will ever ever return .
did n't come back out to clean tables .
this was late afternoon and no excuse for dirty tables .
there was hardly any pesto .
the staff were college guys who did n't seem to really care about anything .
it really grossed me out and i will never be back !
this place is very dirty !
but the service is bad .
the one star was for the lady who had our order to our table .
visiting the madison , wi area and stopped in before 11am to have lunch .
ordered three meals ... they all came out wrong .
they did not bring me a side salad .
the area around the soda machines was disorganized and dirty .
i flagged down the waiter and told him my concern .
his only response was -- '' well , no one else has complained '' .
no apology was given , no option for a reduced cost on my desert .
another classic example of an overrated and overpriced restaurant .
at the birthday dinner , i ordered the ribeye steak .
all in all , otto 's food was not absolutely horrible .
i 've tried it twice and will not be back .
food was very mediocre .
fillings of sandwiches were fine , but the bread tasted stale .
overall , not a good experience .
the coffee that was in the hot pots was cold .
food is good but the wifi is horrible .
this seemed odd since they make sandwiches - they ca n't dress your bagel ?
i double checked to make sure they had given me plain cream cheese .
yup plain cream cheese .
the bagel was pretty bland - a bit disappointing for an everything bagel .
filthy and rude .
panera sucks , but this panera really sucks .
salad was lackluster to begin with .
tables not wiped down .
only plus is lunch for under $ _num_ .
my husband and i often grab lunch here when running around on a saturday .
not exactly the family friendly environment i think of when i think of panera .
the staff here seemed very stuck up to me .
not the place to go if you are a beginner .
not something i really want to think about .
she was very very demanding in what what going to happen during the class .
not ideal .
at this point , i knew i was dealing with a leadership issue here .
i did try out other instructors to get a return on my investment .
the other instructors were great .
very disappointing .
i do not recommend this place for lunch .
food - a waste of money .
i wish i could get a refund .
the small pieces of salmon were okay , though nothing exceptional .
the side salad ... ... ... wtf did they put on these greens ?
it tasted like bitter vinegary dish water .
random second hand tables , though most had their own set of matching chairs .
i do n't know about bread but meals here are not good .
we have n't eaten here in awhile .
unfortunately i ca n't rave about it this time .
today it was more like coleslaw , very disappointing .
we wo n't be wasting time or money here again .
one said her latte was bad .
another said his earl grey tea was weak .
but this was the worst iced mocha i 've ever had .
the smoked salmon benedict is drenched in hollandaise .
too much .
it was a fine sandwich , but not worth basically twenty bucks .
the more i have it the worse and worse it gets .
the crust is too much like cardboard for me .
and the ingredients are really , really cheap .
they were too busy talking and deciding which cd to play .
after waiting for a time , i walked out .
i could n't believe how rude they were .
the only flavor mine had was from the $ _num_ worth of peppers .
the desserts were also very disappointing .
the picture of tiramisu on the menu was square and looked homemade .
all-in-all i 'm pretty disappointed .
we probably wo n't return here , at least not for the pan pizza .
there goes another star .
in past visits , we 've had the thin crust .
i think rosati 's does this much better .
sure enough , after calling , i found out i was right .
if i could give this restaurant _num_ stars i would .
nothing on the vegetarian pizza .
i called to speak with the manager and he was quite rude .
i would not recommend this pizza place .
they advertise `` chicago style '' pizza but they clearly know nothing about it .
presentation was awful !
the manager did nothing to remedy the situation .
extremely rude !
worst pizza ever .
the food is of poor quality .
the crust is close to cardboard .
the salad did not taste good .
soggy fries and _num_ hours delivery times .
life 's too short to eat mediocre pizza .
both offerings were exceptionally mediocre .
the sauce had that overcooked , right out of a can flavor .
if you are looking for cheap and filling , this is your place .
also , their `` customer service '' is kinda crappy .
so , amongst other things , i ordered two chicken sandwiches and cheese curds .
both came plain , with no lettuce , tomato , or mayo .
cheese curds also came with no sauce .
first time ordering through rosati 's .
the delivery went ok , no complaints there .
i was unable to finish a single dish because everything was drenched in salt .
- the garlic bread was hard instead of crispy , salty instead of garlicky .
so , in the future ... no .
probably will not order from rosati 's again .
this is the second time we 've been disappointed .
the crust was soggy and had little flavor .
very disappointed paying $ _num_ for a pizza that was n't very good .
terribly disappointed .
pizza was cold .
sauce was tasteless .
bland .
we ordered baked lasagna dinner and ribs with fries dinner tonight .
apparently the lasagna was ok , he ate that .
second , the garlic bread was burnt , tough , and gross .
third , the personal pan pizza ( cheese with pineapple ) .
as stated in other reviews , extremely greasy and messy .
i emailed the contact twice - no reply .
this is horrible work ethic .
the baked potato tasted dry and leftover .
went here for dinner last week and it was just meh .
food was bland an uninspired .
what the waitress offered as the special was not what was delivered .
the kitchen and management could do a lot better .
probably will not go here again for dinner .
too bad because we do like the place overall .
crap service !
not to mention my son only got half of what he ordered ... .
combine this with extremely mediocre service .
worst service ever .
italian dressing was blah , bleu cheese dressing had no bleu cheese chunks .
_num_ minutes later , with no waitress , no food , we left .
we will not be back .
no one ever did so we left .
we were n't disappointed .
tonight we went back and our experience was the opposite .
the fish was okay and the waffle fries were cold .
my husband asked why we did n't get any bread .
not sure we need to go back .
espresso tastes average , like a starbucks .
two of us ordered panini and they were very disappointing .
but , desperately in need of deep cleaning and updating .
maybe he was was out of everything except the reasonably ok medium roast .
now i remember why i was n't planning to come in here again !
victor 's charges $ _num_ .
no big deal ; i wo n't make a big fuss over _num_ cents .
that just seems insane .
i 'm sad to say they have lost my business .
i had hip problems , and was referred here by dr. adams .
total garbage .
total joke of a doctor .
there was standing water in the back half of the rather cramped dining area .
you can only order huge cones at a very premium price .
the quality control is not there .
it drives my totally crazy .
oh how i miss what you once were michael 's frozen custard .
not worth the price , unless for a special occasion .
i had such a bad experience that i will never go back .
if my raspberry shake was in any way natural , i 'd be surprised .
it was overpriced , understaffed and the tables outside were sticky .
both the burger and the fries were terribly under seasoned and bland .
shakes for under _num_ bucks ... like you 're in the _num_ 's .
do not give michael 's frozen custard your business !
she went back because they did n't place a cherry on top .
i devoured mine , while my friend slowly delighted hers .
they are n't there .
i 'm unsure if i will return unless pressed to do so by others .
might i suggest go elsewhere ?
this place is extremely expensive .
i would n't recommend the shakes , but the custard is alright .
but if there are other options , then try finding something cheaper !
having read the other reviews here , i was expecting a lot better .
we tired two different soups , both of which were no more than mediocre .
they ride that thin like between decadent and disgusting .
we were disappointed .
the service was attentive , but the food was not very good .
the atmosphere was noisy and industrial .
i had a hard time deciding between a _num_ or _num_ star rating .
however i went last week and the entire experience ranged from average to awful .
my dining companion rated his black bean burger as average .
still underwhelmed with the food and can not justify adding any stars .
i split the risotto and a combo plate of spinach and chicken enchiladas .
update : the chocolate cake was bomb .
i ordered the seared tuna , he ordered the burger .
changing servers in the middle of a meal service .
the decor was interesting but i was n't really feeling the ambiance .
i stopped by another time for their famous desserts and was again somewhat disappointed .
maybe it was a really , really bad night for the kitchen .
i mean , how could both meals be bad ?
they could have mentioned that when we were seated , but they did n't .
i wo n't be going back .
sadly , not for me .
went for dinner ... food was n't very impressive at all .
none of the food that we got was that good .
high expectations , complete disappointment .
would n't recommend eating dinner here but the desserts did look splendid .
nothing we ate was above average , actually the majority of it was inedible .
way too expensive for the poor quality of food .
lettuce a little brown , rolls very out of bag from store feeling .
i 'm not sure what some of the yelpers liked so much ?
my salad was plain .
not a awful experience , but not very good .
would not give 2nd try .
this place really disappointed me .
only the soups arrived .
it was n't particularly warm , however .
and the salad that was served with it was terrible .
and the mashed potatoes were , by all accounts , terrible .
they were so bad , but i ate all of them anyway . ''
that could n't even be bothered to have happened .
it was n't dry .
it was beyond gross .
we did n't finish the cake .
i simply do n't understand why .
it just was n't good .
have eaten here several times before .
an unfortunate choice .
the sandwich was so filled with chicken that it was impossible to pick up .
the chicken was completely bland like the chef forgot any spices .
there was also supposed to be gorgonzola cheese and it too was nearly absent .
bottom line is that the place is filthy .
we had heard great things but were pretty disappointed .
the over-cooked burger was beyond plain .
the home made tater tots were interesting but not good .
overall a quite boring lunch .
it 's gross and otherwise ruins one of my favorite places in town .
personally , it 's not for me .
its offerings for vegetarians are limited .
service can be good to fairly awful .
i was incredibly disappointed .
the food was horrible .
i ordered french toast with berries on sourdough bread .
horrible food and expensive for what it is .
my husband ordered scramble eggs which looked horrible also .
will not go there again .
newly remodeled , although still ugly .
my other half ordered the hot buttered rum for her alcoholic beverage of choice .
_num_ stars on the app .
the waitress brought out another plate as well , so we could share .
we finished the rib , minus the 1/3 of it that was fat .
meanwhile , we ate the mashed potatoes and broccoli .
with that said , what a boring side .
tab was $ _num_ plus tip .
i got these chicken enchiladas that were said to come with beans .
they were so dry .
dry and flavorless .
so disappointing .
again , flavorless .
just pass on this place .
disappointed in this lack of hospitality here in my city .
dinner was fine , but underwhelming .
ive only gone in for lunch but everything ive had has been stellar .
the only plus side was the bacon on the sandwich that was cooked correctly .
they were fine , but nothing special .
for my entre i ordered the chile rellenos and was pretty disappointed .
the menu described a pepper stuffed with rice , mushrooms and spinach .
i 'm glad i finally went , but i wo n't be back .
tonight i had a _num_ $ juicy burger which was anything but .
dry and flavorless is a better description .
the place is dirty and not as lively as it was .
was extremely unimpressed with the food and atmosphere .
not worth the wait .
most recently , i had an eggs benedict .
oh , i do like the decor of the place .
overall quite disappointing for me .
not a big deal , just curious .
the restaurant was not busy at all , about half capacity when we arrived .
ordering took no more than _num_ minutes for the lot of us .
by this time my beverage was empty .
as far as the food goes ... i will say hit and miss .
i will say that their consistency of preparation was appalling .
three of us ordered the meatball flight and none were prepared similarly .
some cold , some burned , some just fine .
same went for the entrees and deserts .
food is ok , not more than that .
been there a few times and have never walked away thinking it was great .
it was more of a mush than a burger , just fell apart .
but awful .
it had been fried too long , and the flavors were no longer distinct .
here 's a serious issue for me , dirty dish 's and silverware .
i showed him the silverware and he still had no response .
i explained to him that this is bad .
there 's no excuse for dirty dishes and silverware !
i was excited to go because i 've heard it 's a madison staple .
ended the meal with flourless cake which again , was incredibly small .
do n't let the interesting menu fool you .
food aside , the big issue is that the service is often awful .
came for sunday brunch and while the food was good the service was awful .
service was terrible .
was told _num_ minute wait only to be seated after _num_ .
had to repeat our order _num_ times because the waitress could n't understand us .
nothing spectacular .
Neutral
i had a turkey sandwich and it was super , super bland .
however , i left there hungry .
do n't rent from these people .
thankfully , that is n't the case and there are many other plumber options .
that 's when they made a bad problem worse .
unfortunately it was an outdated model so he could n't replace it .
sure it cost more - but that was our only option .
_num_ hours after he left we had dripping water into our kitchen .
she 's not a plumber .
she should n't have to diagnosis a plumbing problem .
brought in two new pairs of jeans to be hemmed .
i wish i were exaggerating .
i am ignored .
and in the end i leave without a purchase .
i was in search of a particular color .
it was probably old info on the website that referred me .
but the salespeople are always just so rotten and unhelpful .
however , the friend did n't want the book .
it 's not that unusual for gifts to be returned .
lousy customer service .
sales staff seemed put out by my questions .
no apology .
no champagne to the room , no discount on my stay .
a seriously overpriced and way too pretentious b & b .
we stayed there once and never , ever again .
recently , i tried booking online but also called to confirm the reservation .
nope - nada for the customer .
unlike most b & bs , the owners do n't live there .
so we managed , but it was off putting to have no one there .
breakfast is n't served until 8:30 a.m. !
that 's ridiculous .
it was too small .
not much higher but enough for another drink during happy hour .
but after that i will not be taking any shoes there again .
this place just sucks .
the food is mediocre and i 'd rather eat taco bell for the price .
oh it must be the margaritas , cause alcohol makes every taste perfect .
i will never waste another night trying to stomach this crap .
this place is mediocre at best .
to be fair , i only order burritos .
i 've tried a few now and they are just so dang bland .
i was so disappointed .
)
if they charged half the price for their food , i could accept that .
but they charge way too much .
beans were undercooked & tamales were so dry ... .
the only decent thing was the beer .
the food continues to be pretty inconsistent and is most noticed in your soups .
one day it 's thick like stew and the next it 's watered down .
in fact , get rid of the plastic cups for the salsa too .
you hardly give the kids any food as it is !
seriously , i 'm starting to feel ripped off !
also a bit pricey - chips and salsa are n't included with meals .
i would not go back to this location .
not my cup of tea .
not big on flavor .
the only good thing about this dining experience was the actual taco .
i would n't recommend it !
the worst food i have ever had in my entire life .
i had the enchilada plate and it was disgusting .
the enchilada was cold and tasted like mush .
i could not even finish half of my plate .
the chips and salsa and guacamole did not have enough flavor .
the waitress was too busy watching tv and was difficult to get her attention .
well , the food was awful .
by the way , they do n't have ground beef ?
it 's now been _num_ hour since we ordered , and nothing .
nothing special .
bland food .
bad service .
disgusting chips and salsa were $ _num_ .
there should be no charge for chips and salsa .
chocolate milk was loudly offered as an option to my son .
empty plates and glasses stacked up and were not removed .
i 've had two bad experiences here .
not bad , not excellent , just somewhere in the middle .
food was ok , portions were big but the flavor was missing something .
i order the steak fajita burrito which was _num_ % filled will onions .
rice and beans were very cold .
one veggie taco being $ _num_ ?
the food was mediocre .
not that great .
well , plans changed and we were starving so there it is .
our waiter was nice , but was not impressed by the food .
we wiped as much as we could off .
i could n't taste the jerk .
the side rice was overly chili powdered and inedible .
gone is the deli from which you could purchase yummy guacamole and other specialties .
unfortunately , the food was really nothing special .
no one in my party even took any leftovers home .
the food was average , nothing stuck out .
the rice was over seasoned and dry .
in particular staff does n't listen well or do what they say .
let 's all agree that most madison take-out pizza is bad .
)
rosati 's - cardboard ( and expensive ) .
the ingredients at bucks are cheap but the pizzas are not .
in addition to the cheap ingredients , their sauce is bad .
they put the toppings ( onion in our case ) under the cheese .
so i had to try this pizza .
it was ok - not impressed .
the service was pretty good .
they do not deliver only pick up service .
i hate giving low reviews but this pizza just didnt cut it .
thin , cardboard like crust .
greasy , so greasy .
absolutely would not recommend .
the concession stand makes its own hours and unfortunately the offerings are pretty sparse .
$ _num_ later , i was satisfied with my experience i had with amy .
let 's fast forward to monday ( march _num_ ) .
i suspect because too much product was applied .
i do n't fault amy for this -- no chip polish is tricky .
we scheduled the appointment for later that week on thursday ( march _num_ ) .
unfortunately , i got sick and had to reschedule ( again ) .
i was told no problem .
why did my dad text me , you 're probably wondering ?
no big deal .
i did n't , because surprise !
she called a number i had n't used in three years .
she offered $ _num_ .
i am not angry with amy who gave me my manicure .
they sent it off and we got it back about a month later .
this happened _num_ more times !
_num_ days later it fell out .
not even real stones .
needless to say we will not be back .
too cookie cutter .
i would not give them my money again .
it 's a shame .
do n't waste your time and $ !
i had to pay $ _num_ up front , i got scammed .
they have really nice audio equipment for sale and the owner is very knowledgable .
over all a really terrible experience .
a waste of time and money .
unfortunately , every time i was in the area the store was closed .
just everything is bad and needs to be replaced .
after this experience i would not pick him again .
pretty frustrating , considering i drove _num_ minutes just to get there .
so i left empty handed .
you probably could find what you 're looking for if he wanted to help .
but he did n't want to help me out .
ok , get to digging .
our experience with jeremy was everything that we would have expected from the reviews .
we were very disappointed with his response and attitude .
we wish them luck .
Negative
no waiting , no hassle and no dismissive , negative attitude .
spend your money elsewhere .
it 's rather unfortunate .
i have also been very disappointed by their online banking .
i was very disappointed and would n't recommend them to anyone .
i do n't like this place too much .
the energy felt a little weird .
maybe the food is just , eh !
it was served with feta cheese , red onions and cucumbers on the side .
there was no kebab .
more of ... eh .
i 'm just did n't enjoy this place , whatever the reason was .
i do n't mind expensive meals as long as they 're worth it .
by the way , baklava should not come with whipped cream .
also , the rug needs to be replaced or at least vacuumed .
the service was bad .
spend your money somewhere else .
honestly , the last time i went in this store was in _num_ .
that is the only good thing about this place .
however , their prices are through the roof .
too much of a hustle .
selection not as deep but still good and zero attitude .
they missed painting the corner of one of my toes .
but i would definitely look elsewhere in the madison area .
really bad service .
i then received the worst paint job ever .
really bad place in madison !
i paid them $ _num_ with $ _num_ tip .
i would not recommend this place to anyone in madison .
i was very disappointed .
the pedicure spa was very clean but the quality was very bad .
the nail polish selection was very limited and low quality .
gel polish is not for everyone .
service was horrible and food was just ok .
it was a friday night and there were maybe _num_ tables of people .
did n't seem like anyone had been trained or wanted to work there .
will not make that mistake again .
this was a horrible place to eat .
the food was the best part but that 's not saying much .
it looks like it is , a hotel restaurant .
first off , they screwed up our reservation .
not worthy of the time , money or calories .
the restaurant smells like an assisted living facility .
service is slow .
the menu seems overpriced , especially given the other dining choices nearby .
all three meals where all right but not amazing .
the quality to price ratio was off ( too expensive ) .
my meal was ordinary with meatballs that where dry and over cooked .
the chicken parmesan marinara sauce was very bland .
the decor is dated and the dim lighting does not hide that .
i would skip this restaurant .
service was horrible .
$ 1,000 for a cake and you leave it ready to fall .
all of this _num_ minutes before the bride was to walk in the door .
horrible vendor !
thank goodness i 'm not in the market for a wedding cake !
no one seemed incredibly amazed by it .
i 'm not entirely sure i would get another one from here again .
needless to say , i never came back or called back .
i left feeling heavy with greasy food .
i also tried one of the almond butter cookies .
i felt that experience was mediocre and not better then that .
it 's like the whole bakery is all day old and freezer burnt .
will not be returning !
both the eggs and crust were really soggy .
waste of money .
household items and furniture are usually in good shape and tend to move quickly .
it 's not just the shoes , the pricing in general is not consistent .
to make it better , the customer service here is terrible .
there is a ton more , but i think you get the point .
living under a bridge would be better .
Negative
should be negative stars .
have never seen this in an apt complex , especially so far from downtown .
sick of seeing squad cars at the bottom of the hill .
skip the trip to west side next time .
it is very long in the tooth .
empty .
there is never anyone at the seafood area to help you .
there is also no bell to ring in the seafood area for service .
the only bell is in the meat section .
there is never anyone in the meat department .
no one is there .
it takes way too long to get help .
if you want groceries , sure , they have groceries !
worst grocery store in memory .
disappointing for money you pay .
avoid if you can .
i have shopped here for a year - have n't had too many issues .
i do n't have the time to check on all of them .
probably not .
we asked for waters three times , and never got anything .
we are not going back .
they may be cute dogs but their being among patrons was not .
and portion size considerably reduced .
in no hurry to return despite years of patronizing this place !
half order of frozen overcooked onion rings , yuck .
lousy service as well .
i love a place with free peanuts in the shell .
someone please message me when they do .
was really disappointed .
there were _num_ menus sitting on our table , which made ordering confusing .
nope , do n't have that one either .
ugh .
also , the burgers are kind of expensive for this hole-in-the-wall place .
i hated the bun that my burger was served on .
the burgers are n't terribly big or meaty .
while the burger was cooked well , overall just meh .
i would n't drive across town to eat this particular burger .
the onion rings we ordered were fine , perhaps a little overcooked .
the place was pretty busy on sunday .
despite being ignored initially by our waitress , she ended up being pretty good .
but otherwise , no , not that great .
just kind of uncomfortable .
it does n't have a lot of room .
there was nothing that was inviting about the place .
the dance floor is about _num_ by _num_ feet .
then there are some benches that are about _num_ by _num_ or even less .
then the bar runs along the back .
the bar server never even smiled .
these plates held a ham slice that was thin and extremely dry .
i mean wow ... is that really the way you run a business ?
dive or not .
this was the worst salon i have ever been too .
it was unbelievable .
do not go to this `` salon . ''
do not go here for coloring .
i wish there was a _num_ i could give !
it 's just sad .
b ) our waitress was non-existent !
i never got a refill of my drink and she was chewing gum !
that is all i have to describe how horrible it was .
she did not seem okay with it . )
nothing had been salted whatsoever .
no salt , no pepper ... not even on the steak !
many places do hash browns better .
again , they really needed salt & pepper .
the quality does n't meet up to the price .
unfortunately i got in my car leaving applebee 's parking lot feeling extremely ill .
i have been sick ever since i ate there .
in fact , just do not go there .
no apology .
so in summary , i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
my husband ordered the roasted garlic sirloin .
the chips were hot which was a big plus .
i had the three cheese chicken penne and it was meh .
not enough sauce and the chicken was on the grill for way too long .
so dry !
place was kind of dirty .
meh meh meh meh meh .
extremely long waiting , poor service and grumpy waitress .
i was disappointed here .
did someone or something die in the corner ?
really , what else would you get at a wisconsin supper club .
should be worst cleaners !
owner claimed it was from wearing jackets with them which i did not do .
first - and last - attempt to patronize this business .
it 's hit or miss .
i know , i know , i should have checked yelp first .
_num_ ) they were `` out '' of thin crust .
umm , yeah weird but ok .
_num_ ) the pizza was truly gross .
it was not good pizza .
i do not get why people go to rocky 's .
the sauce tastes like sugar and the crust is soggy .
you are better off purchasing a frozen pizza .
really bad experience .
worst cheesy breadsticks !
barely any cheese as well .
however this location is a disappointment to the brand .
the place is dated and dirty .
will never return to this location .
the au jus sauce should n't come served on a the side .
poor quality .
lasagna was bad .
not worth the money .
horrible store that does not support its best asset , their employees .
aside from the buckets and bathroom , the food was mediocre at best .
this was my first and only visit .
i have never encountered such rude , unprofessional staff .
i only gave this place one star only because i had to .
an appointment was scheduled for later in the week at the s. park office .
so save yourself unnecessary work and avoid this dental chain .
beware - ski equipment is not on sale year round !
they seem to be higher than anyone else .
that was n't meant as a compliment .
gag me .
$ _num_ for an old fashioned ?
i 'm not sure what that means .
it was terrible and it did not sit well with my stomach .
why someone would do this is beyond me .
no one asked if i was ok .
can we say trailer trash ?
meh ... i thought it was just okay .
the pork fried rice was just okay ... nothing special , but not bad .
and finally , the sesame chicken was just not good .
disappointing .
probably wo n't order from them again .
our veggie moo shu was boring & had no egg in it ?
the wraps for the moo shu made me feel like i was eating paper .
ordered here for the first time , after hearing great reviews .
not sure how this place is rated so highly .
not that it is particularly bad just nothing worth writing home about .
only been once , do n't plan to go back .
the pork was just bad .
avoid this place at all costs .
lasted just shy of two weeks .
the salon is badly in need of updating .
i 've been here before and did have a ok experience .
the polish did n't meet the bottom or sides of my nail .
he just figured i did a bang up job on them , myself .
do they charge everyone $ _num_ for a simple mani/pedi ?
could n't have been a worse experience .
$ _num_ for something that lasts a week .
just awful nails .
terrible experience !
there was n't .
and my mom could n't even get hers done .
my shellac only lasted about a week .
again , a terrible experience and i do not recommend them .
to bad .
i gave my dog the rest .
our experience was so terrible .
i was so offended by how poorly i was treated during our phone call .
as a comparison , i bought my bridal gown at a different shop .
absolutely unprofessional and incompetent , not to mention downright rude .
yeah , maybe you do n't always get what you want .
but you should get what you pay for .
the staff was rude and shady .
there was bird poop on and near the court .
i would rate this worse than a star if that was possible .
id rather play outside in the sub freezing wisconsin weather than play here again .
now , the space itself is nothing special .
this place did not have that and i was very disappointed .
i really disliked my visit to this dollar tree .
no cash back , no gift card .
i will not be going back here unless it 's a dollar tree emergency .
i had the raspberry chicken salad which was overly sweet and lacked real flavor .
now the mediocre ... nachos ... how do you screw up nachos ?
there is the option to add beef , buffalo chicken or chicken mix .
chicken mix comes with green pepper and onion .
none of the other toppings were anywhere to be found .
chicken strips look more like clam strips and were overcooked and tough .
burgers are ok , but nothing special .
this is a really tough review for me to write .
however , the food and prices could be improved .
what stands out are the cheese curds .
the oil pools in the bottom making the lower layer even more oily .
it was a tropical , pineapple cake .
the frosting was not thick and creamy .
it had no real flavor .
honestly , i can not express how disappointed i was in the cake .
there was no strong punch of flavor .
underwhelming , the food was just not good .
it was flavorless and lacked passion .
service was very slow . )
my pasta dish was not good .
to top it off , the women 's bathroom was disgusting !
we wo n't be going back .
food was mediocre .
overall will not be going back at a busy time .
however , we went there _num_ weeks ago to try their fish fry .
one of our friends had the baked fish , and it was cold !
they gave him fish again , and it was extremely hot .
it was very disappointing !
sat at the bar for _num_ minutes and both bartenders ignored me .
_num_ o'clock at night not acceptable will not be back .
snow and ice storm the person backed out on me .
i was extremely hurt and upset .
worst .
i canceled my order and wish there were another quality option .
big mistake .
furthermore there are trees on their lot that are really suffering .
ugh .
update : i 've grown tired of this place .
how hard is it to regularly stock the paper ?
nothing changed as far as where the seating area is .
anyway , i 've had enough and am taking my business elsewhere .
and no , i did n't find a new coffee shop .
this is the worst noodles i have ever been to .
the staff was very nice about fixing the mistake quickly .
something has changed and we just plain do n't care to eat here anymore .
_num_ stars for food but not a-ok overall because of the service .
i 'm really disappointed .
i move them down one star again for the bad service experience .
how is that for customer service ?
this particular noodles location ... not so much .
no , sorry .
this location is terrible .
they get orders wrong regularly and do n't do anything to fix their mistakes .
last friday i came in around 6pm and ordered a fruit spinach salad .
i also contacted corporate and got no response .
however , this location has messed up the last time .
probably around 8pm .
i should have asked for my money back .
i have been to many other noodles and have never been disappointed !
this one however needs some serious changes .
the only thing this noodles had goin for them was a mostly friendly staff .
there is a lot of fabric but nothing particularly interesting not of high quality .
are there no good fabric stores in madison ?
very disappointed .
giving this place one star only because i can not give it a zero .
terrible customer service .
counter staff clearly has not been trained well .
poor selection of frames .
i wish that i could give this location a review lower than one star .
worst customer service experience at the print station .
you might like their rolls , but they really should n't call them bagels .
i felt like i was bothering the employees here with my order .
the meat here was cold and the flavor was awful .
boring , bland and over priced for what it is .
i just wanted some steak tacos with no onions .
my first plate arrived , onions obviously present in the tacos .
second plate : tortilla , steak , nothing else in the tacos .
it 's too bad because the service was usually great .
horrible horrible food .
this is not mexican food in any shape form or fashion .
even the rice is n't authentic .
the tamale was edible , but not fantastic .
and the taco was more disgusting than taco bell .
ugh .
bad call .
service was bad from the minute we walked in .
should n't he know how much to charge ?
the meat was decent , but everything else tasted bland , and well.
but , at the same time , raising their prices .
all three of our entrees were cold .
the refried beans were ice cold .
it was gross .
on our trip there last wednesday night my son ordered the rio bravo .
he was sick with food poisoning later that night and into the next day .
however , my last two visits have left a lot to be desired .
so tasty ... but then about an hour later i was sick .
kind if boring .
too many huge chunks of jalapeo in the guacamole .
the quesadilla my mom got was inedible , full of way undercooked mushrooms .
the bean burrito was just what seemed like canned refried beans .
it just was n't that good .
mediocre food .
second time , chicken enchiladas and it was dry as hell .
not feeling it .
i ordered the half chimichanga off the lunch menu for $ _num_ .
did they squeeze it out of a tube ?
so disappointing .
my entree was the poblano mole enchiladas .
when our meals finally arrived , i was not impressed .
my tostada was limp as it soaked up the sauce from somewhere else .
i guess i 'm just not their target market .
the prices were absurd !
now , i 'm willing to pay a little more for something really nice .
no purchase from me !
depending on the name brand , each shirt or dress was priced differently .
i do not care for this type of pricing .
maybe after the award , all the vintage got bought out ... sorry .
if you hate your job so much , leave it !
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
she yelled at us even if it was n't our fault .
_num_ .
gross !
i 'm not an idiot and this was not my first shellac .
alas , it does not .
very annoying .
i literally just walked out the door .
personally , it completely turned me off .
terrible customer service .
i would not go out of your way to buy a nice bike here .
i stood there for _num_ minutes and no one came to help .
regardless , two awful experiences with this place are enough to keep me away .
there wasnt much sausage at all for what you paid for .
the sauce that went with them was bland .
it was dry , the chicken was tough and there was absolutely no taste .
the french bread looks so boring i didnt even bother to taste it .
very disappointing .
i also tried the dirty rice and it was awful !
pathetic .
the `` sausage '' was paper thin and may have well not even existed .
wo n't be back .
such a disappointment .
i 've been consistent with ordering jambalaya because its the quintessential new orleans dish .
new orleans take out does n't have this right !
( also no corn or jalapeo or sweetness .
it was n't a full step above a jiffy mix really .
a nice place but a major rip off .
the trick is to make sloppy measurements on the upside and charge extra .
these stores have no standards for prices .
they charge whatever they feel like .
tried to ship a package here via ups .
holy hole in a doughnut , batman !
asked for owner to request a more reasonable price .
_num_ dollars !
sadly , it 's gone the way of the grand ave .
maybe they can lease it out for a zombie movie ?
i realize this is carryout chinese and my rating reflects this understanding .
unfortunately , it was just incredibly bland and boring .
in the end , it just was n't great .
total price was like $ _num_ or so .
i have had diagnosed food poisoning before and this was it .
my guess would be the egg rolls .
it 's cheap for a reason .
lunch , meet garbage can .
terrible !
food tastes like crap and the customer service is horrible .
woman behind the counter looked miserable did n't smile once .
no `` thank you '' no `` come again '' nothing .
i could n't believe it !
one cut , maybe , but more than that ?
she could have at least said something so he could watch for infection .
she gets offended when i ask her if she even understood what i wanted .
so anyway , up until now i was the only customer in the place .
i would give them _num_ stars if possible .
i did so because martin has him as a repair facility .
the martin was a warrant repair , the other was not .
i did n't because of the good reviews .
so he spent another half hour fixing that problem .
the martin looks like crap .
and seems to have done more bad than good .
if i could give this college no stars that would be my rating .
totally false !
this woman was totally disorganized and a liar .
furthermore , communication with anyone from the college of education is a joke .
you can wait weeks until you get a response to your emails .
it 's a total ripoff .
wish i could give more stars but this place could be so much better .
dipping sauce does n't have enough ginger or sesame .
not spicy , even after requesting spicy , and just not very flavorful .
i wish i could give this place no stars .
first , all of our food was the same ugly color brown .
my husband who loves spicy food could n't even eat it .
the sesame chicken was so sour that no one wanted to eat it .
the lo mein had no taste .
the crab rangoon was so greasy that it left a coating in our mouths .
caution : this store is really small .
i could n't find much variety there .
i really , really hate this place .
i know , i know , it can not be true .
i stopped going there , though convenient .
no lady , i do n't want the damn credit card so stop asking !
glad i was just passing through and this is n't my local store .
we have taken _num_ cars there the last year _num_ times .
the environment is really noisy .
i do n't want to go back once more .
worst customer service i have ever experienced !
it would not work with my _num_ week old debit card !
worst mcdonalds ever .
oh , and the drink area is disgusting .
i explained this to them and they sent a tech to our house .
am i glad i had them come out !
pretty worthless as i was unable to actually look at their product .
do n't know if that 's true or not .
it has been over _num_ weeks and they still do n't have it in !
ok , do n't yell at me ... i 'm the customer .
not my fault !
my updated rating on this store has gone down .
they did n't believe we had actually ordered .
ridiculous .
flooring did n't last and we replaced that , too .
a linen closet door is not square .
our garage door fell apart .
our water heater died after _num_ years .
but i ca n't wait to move .
nothing special .
typical of this type of family restaurant .
many pages of menu items , from liver and onions to eggs & bacon .
not so sure now .
the food for the most though is just mediocre .
the coffee is so-so and most everything is too greasy for my taste .
if you like oil and grease , you 'll like it here .
sadly , i can not rate the food here .
when we walked in , we were not greeted .
the man at the register proceeded to cash out other patrons , ignoring us .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
what horrible service .
there were like _num_ tables full and _num_ waitresses available .
maybe she would have realized i never touched my food .
the broccoli cheddar soup looked like it came out of a can .
compared to the east side goodwill this one falls way short .
the bed news , part of the reason for yelping so badly .
this place is horrible .
well two and a half weeks later still no car .
if you really want my business own your mistakes .
they lost my appointment several times and it took ages to get in .
various receptionists gave me false information on how to schedule the estimates and repairs .
to say this experience was frustrating is an understatement .
but they fall down on the food and cleanliness .
their bathroom is not terrible but not clean either and small .
sometimes two napkins full of grease .
have n't been back for some time now due to the food quality issues .
waited for two minutes , , , , , still no one .
omg this place sucks .
it was horrible .
it was pure crap .
however , i was n't too pleased with their pizza by the slice .
- breakfast is lousy and the lounge is not clean .
- some of the front desk staff is downright rude .
i am very dissatisfied with the lack of customer service that this hotel provides .
they could easily have left a message .
i did that , but i did not receive my voucher the first night .
i checked the door hang , and she was incorrect .
i will never stay at the sheraton madison again .
i ordered room service _num_ days for breakfast .
second day , not as good .
third day , it was awful .
walls were very thin .
not good !
some front desk people were fabulous and some not so much .
some staff were helpful .
some seemed uninterested , the shuttle bus drivers were very nice .
the room was clean and the hall decor seemed updated and fine with me .
this sheraton is run much different that an average sheraton .
in short : nice staff , not badly run sheraton !
_num_ .
this is just unacceptable .
all of us used it until someone realized it was spoiled .
_num_ .
the very same machine did not function most of the days .
_num_ .
_num_ .
nobody was not able to talk due to high noise .
_num_ .
we tried it and realized that it was still broken .
_num_ .
the room keys did not work one day .
why inconvenience guests with broken key system ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
one light bulb at the dining room in _num_ is out .
_num_ .
the window is covered with bird crap ( _num_ ) .
it looks like it is old bird crap .
this place is run down and needs serious remodeling .
the second room had a stain on the carpet going into the bathroom .
again not very clean .
overall , service is inconsistent .
but unfortunately the rest of the employees and the establishment do .
my girlfriend and i recently stayed at this sheraton .
needless to say , my experience there was very disappointing .
that was the one by the sink .
for your own comfort , we ask that the windows be kept closed .
sucks .
: / i would not go back here .
stayed here _num_ nights .
desk staff were just ok , bartender was rude .
just not good .
not impressed .
-the staff was not very friendly or very attentive .
i wo n't stay here again , and i would not recommend it .
it looked unclean and the staff clueless .
avoid at all costs .
is n't lady bugs supposed to bring good luck ?
i really did n't feel so lucky .
hotel hallways were a little dark with all the dark wood around .
i did n't sleep well there .
this is one of my worst experience at a 4/5 star hotel .
she did n't even greet me or acknowledge me .
this was room _num_ .
i also left a note in room _num_ for housekeeping .
this is one of my worst experience at a 4/5 star hotel .
she did n't even greet me or acknowledge me .
this was room _num_ .
i also left a note in room _num_ for housekeeping .
not the most family friendly hotel .
had to go find a local walgreens to buy milk and snacks at .
walls are very thin so can hear everyone walking down the halls talking loudly .
_num_ .
my room did not smell good when i returned in the evening .
the gentleman did not seem to care at all either .
the room was nice and bed was comfortable .
the walls were thin and i could hear the tv from my neighbor .
bad idea .
all the food was ice cold and disgusting .
the room was pretty crappy for the expectations as well .
he also rudely told me not to print anything from the computers .
service slow .
did n't wash , did n't wear gloves .
how wrong i was !
i ignored it , and i paid the price .
learn from my mistake !
slow , rude , disrespectful staff .
very uncomfortable place to be in .
they often mess up your order and get an attitude about fixing it .
she do n't or never admit they made mistake .
so we wo n't go there until she is gone .
they will mess your order up .
on top of the variety of issues , the workers are unfriendly and inefficient .
if you have special needs do not eat here !
i wish i could give no stars .
we went because we had a coupon , but we were still disappointed .
my food was also boring and uninspired .
the burger i had was overcooked .
the fries my boyfriend ordered were the highlight of the meal .
that is n't saying much .
i would not eat here again .
however , i was sorely disappointed .
so i went to olive garden instead .
ate dinner before meeting a bunch of friends .
bar staff was sort of hit and miss as well .
guy behind the bar was pretty rude and worthless .
i just get less impressed each time i go back .
i did not eat any food .
the service was pretty bad .
my whole table of _num_ was thinking of the bad service .
btw , _num_ other people in the place .
unfortunately , i will make up for that _num_ % faster than they will .
after _num_ minutes , my food arrived .
at least i did n't get ill from eating here .
filthy , dirty , clogged toilets , stunk , etc .
do n't think i 'll be going here again to eat .
trying to place a food order was frustrating .
alright so i 've only ever been here when i 've been hungover .
i went here recently , and i had a spinach and cheese omelet .
fail .
decided to stop in here for breakfast and was not happy with the omelet .
the pancakes were ok i guess but nothing spectacular .
it was all cooked ok , just not the best recipe .
it may be that it comes down to the chef .
i spent so much time chewing everything else went cold .
it was cooked to my liking its just they have horrible cuts of meat .
a little cramped but not too bad .
ill still patronize your bakery but as for meals i think i am done .
the new place helps but i 'm not so sure i like the layout .
we joked around a little with our waitress and she barely cracked a smile .
so whatever it was was showing up in her attentiveness to her customers .
i got a honey mustard chicken sandwhich thing and horrible food poisoning .
all of them were because i was hungry and nothing else was open .
the food is n't necessarily bad but it 's not good either .
it 's very much ... it 's hard to describe .
there are usually _num_ servers working the entire diner .
also , kudos to them for being professional .
food again is n't bad but it 's your typical late night diner food .
at that location were almost no customers during my few visits around that time .
service was really bad !
servers seems mad and annoyed .
she rolled her eyes and was really rude .
does n't even deserve _num_ star !
okay , no problem .
i 'm sorry , but that is unacceptable .
she saw us , did n't say anything and walked back into the kitchen .
there 's no reason we should have waited so long .
and as i already mentioned , there was hardly anybody in the place .
therefore , expect to wait 15-20 minutes for your order to be taken .
the kids menu was full of syrup and was just gross .
my husbands breakfast of eggs and steak were good too , according to him .
the fries were crispy , but you cant really mess that up .
this is where it got really awkward .
i mean , it 's not like we did it on purpose .
it was just so ... awkward .
i signed my slip and asked for change to leave a tip .
never could i sit through another meal here .
which is a shame since i live about a block away .
if i could give no stars , i would .
this location is horrible !
i decided since it took so long , i would just eat them anyways .
the nachos bell grande only had cheese and sour cream .
it does n't end there .
all the tables were dirty , i had to clean one myself .
there is a reason people do n't frequent the south side for food .
the guy seemed angry that i asked ; i was surprised he said no .
i could not be any more disappointed in this property .
wrong !
this by far , was my worst experience at a hotel ... ever !
not impressed .
slept without any blankets as had to work in the morning .
staff did n't compensate or fix the problem .
life is too short to deal with them .
install took twice as long as they promised and had many issues .
they also do n't do floor trim .
it 's just not worth the hassle for me .
the produce section was borderline scary and i would never buy produce from there .
the $ _num_ lunch special is a burger and fries .
no service at all .
food in the past was n't all that good to begin with .
sadly disappointed on how bad this place has become over the past few years .
stopped saturday late afternoon for one $ _num_ beer .
while they admitted it was there error , no actual apology was given .
later that afternoon , i get a call from someone else at badger bowl .
beware .
i go out to relax and get served .
call badger bowl and ask them why do they hate kids .
within a _num_ day period , two more advertisement ( spam ) emails followed .
we struggled to find anything we liked that was in stock .
one week was n't the end of the world .
i refuse to ever give them my money again !
sleazy .
then i get a call they will show up at _num_ am .
i told them that would n't work , and was promised later .
it took me _num_ scheduled appointments to get things right .
i would n't do any business with them that required future delivery .
crap store .
was normal item just did n't know if they carried it .
i did n't want to know price just if they had it .
i have no clue what they carry since they just dropped so many items .
i would avoid american but for sure the west madison location !
bought a small lamp but when got home it would not work !
called they can '' t exchange it ... ... got screwed out of _num_ !
american tv ... .
i will not miss you !
i 'm _num_ years old .
i wo n't be back .
they did n't seem to care .
it 's my own fault , really .
these guys do n't deserve even _num_ star .
the problem was n't the cook though .
when my food was ready she was n't paying attention .
the men that work there are terrible .
not accommodating and very rude .
if youre an attractive woman , dont go there .
they are rude as hell !
place states that they are open from _num_ am to 2:30 am .
they repeatedly kept yelling to head to the doors and get out .
they can close when they want but the way they approached us was appalling .
there are flies all over the place .
i would n't recommend this dairy queen to anyone .
if you can avoid it , go to a different dairy queen .
nasty .
hell no .
it was not worth $ _num_ , the variety of food was real limited .
mcdonalds would get the award !
this review is long overdue .
the worst cleaning service ever .
my home is under _num_ sq .
i know how long it takes to thoroughly clean this house .
this woman 's attitude and demeanor was the only thing worse than the cleaning .
i was not comfortable with that for obvious reasons .
( no worries there . )
i called back , she refused to get on the phone .
ate lunch there yesterday and it was pretty gross .
why serve a baked potato with vegetable oil spread instead of real butter ?
really zero stars !
i do n't know why but they ca n't get my order right .
the food in the bag is always wrong .
my kids like wendy 's but we will not try it again .
went back to get it and they still messed it up .
at least the chicken nuggets were ok , said my son .
a _num_ min drive home .
text book failure .
nobody seems to care at all about what they are doing .
not to mention the place is just dirty .
but this one is downright terrible .
every time i go there my order is wrong , cold , or overdone .
the staff have no clue what 's going on .
there was only one car in front of us .
they spent at least _num_ minutes at the window .
irritated , i say no i 'll just take my money back .
what a waste of time .
i took it to one of the dealers and had the bike looked at .
i am only giving the service dept _num_ star .
the license plate did not fit the california license plate on my indian motorcycle .
the list of what they provide was a mile long and the bill ?
$ _num_ to $ _num_ !
i called other vet clinics and no one even touched this price .
i would not recommend this vet clinic .
the staff and dr hook are unprofessional and rude .
chris , the vet tech , was the only positive thing about this visit .
he was extremely indifferent to the inconvenience the error had caused me .
he showed no compassion that my _num_ lb .
dr. hook does not deserve you .
admittedly it was late friday and saturday .
but i should have realized that they did not really want this job .
they were rushing , must have had a bigger job to get to next .
price was fair , service was less than desirable .
they charge too much , care is so-so .
i would go to veterinary emergency service .
i wish i could do it all over again .
terrible experience .
the guys that showed up worked hard , but clearly management needs improvement .
so , i hired them again for my next move .
my fiance and i called them several times to check their arrival status .
very frustrating experience the second time around .
horrible .
rude to paying customers plus they overcharged me .
Negative
later found out my friends had similar negative experiences with them .
hire a better company .
horribly unprofessional .
very rude .
nobody has any idea of the concept of customer service .
worst moving experience .
would never hire again .
one of their movers was not capable of handling my move .
he then called his wife , owner brenda and talked to her about it .
if they wanted an inventory , they should have asked .
your complaint was assigned id _num_ .
waited _num_ minutes before in got to the second window .
silly me for thinking there was time .
avoid this location if at all possible .
the girl who answered the phone tonight was really rude .
i like their pizza but not the poor customer service .
not very clean inside and slow .
everytime i have tried eating here , i get sick .
but never at other pizza pits .
last time i got a delivery , the driver smelled like beer !
depressing , depressing , depressing .
also , sad .
wrong , on both counts .
ugh .
ugh .
it was hard not to worry what the future holds for them .
ugh .
ugh .
ugh .
small animal department : let 's just not even go there ... .
everything about it seems run down and outdated .
everything looks pretty dingy , though , and the bathroom was downright disgusting .
gross .
employees really could n't care less .
even though i had already called and they confirmed they had what i wanted .
what a waste of time .
the store is nothing fancy by any means .
this place is terrible .
prices are high but my biggest complaint is that the selection is terrible .
do n't waste your time .
stayed here recently for a race and it was just ok .
breakfast in the morning was standard for that type of thing .
all in all , nothing terrible .
my second room was much nicer and cleaner .
i ca n't replace the shirt , they do n't make it anymore .
i 've never been so poorly treated in my life .
this type of experience does n't happen with marriott .
i 'm beyond disgusted .
the hot tub had black water in it .
no kidding .
you could n't see the bottom of the tub .
the water smelled disgusting like smelly feet .
if you 're a serious business traveler , you should avoid .
free breakfast is low end and the facilities are all substandard .
nothing around .
customer service after the sale was a complete disaster .
i 'll be buying my sofa elsewhere .
after they have your money it is impossible to get customer service .
after they have your money it is impossible to get customer service .
horrible experience !
terrible service !
horrible experience !
terrible service !
it 's also bad for our planet and the air we all breath .
terrible shopping experience !
so we wait to hand her the money .
i could n't get anyone to help me in this store !
salespeople would apparently rather do nothing than wait on a woman by herself .
they waited on couples and single men but not me .
sales associate became pushy , insulted other businesses , was not respectful .
unfortunately , their customer service sucks .
horrible customer service all the way around .
we will not be back .
thanks for having me waste my whole afternoon .
this is a manager that appears to be related to ownership .
they refused to give me a price over the phone .
why advertise if you do n't have the inventory ?
makes no sense at all .
they said they can not fix it because it is over the year warranty .
come to find out they wo n't cover it either .
they just lost a good customer .
their standard of quality has fallen over the last couple years .
the burnt bacon only making the situation worse .
i do n't get it .
really , i do n't .
but seriously , i do n't get it .
it 's not spicy .
it 's kind of cheesy .
no thanks .
ugh .
oh , and the price -- $ _num_ ?
are you fucking kidding me ?
just ... so much no .
overpriced rip off .
cold .
no cheese .
frankly , i think this was completely overpriced .
for $ _num_ , it 's totally overpriced .
i wo n't be buying this again ; it 's completely overrated .
the bread had a bit of cheese nothing special .
these people must not have ever had good bread .
second visit was a disaster .
i wait and wait and my car is just sitting there .
wtf _num_ 1/2 hours for an air filter ?
i 've been to this location twice now for relatively simple maintenance .
however , i also needed brake work .
how are you not careful with brakes , knowing that there are children passengers .
avoid this place .
it 's not worth it .
two years ago my father in law was rushed to the er .
it was unbelievable !
parking is a ripoff and all signs in the building are posted poorly .
we wasted an incredible amount of money for nothing .
the first impression was not very bright .
the lobby is cluttered and receptionist is very unwelcoming .
neither friendly .
we did not bother to ask what ingredients are in it .
after checking other reviews unfortunately we will not be back .
i was told , `` no , we do n't have space '' .
they have adequate products , but their produce section is disgusting and crowded .
really wish they had better inventory .
total ripoff !
each and every one of them was rotten .
it 's not worth the headache .
selling rotten fruit for sky high prices ?
very bad experience .
the service was rude & disrespectful .
does this place even have a phone number ?
had a stuffed pizza and was n't impressed in the least .
more importantly , every ingredient in the pizza sucked .
finally , the cheese just was n't up to wisconsin standards .
$ _num_ for a medium ?
tl ; dr : worst .
worst service ever !
the employees do not want to be working there .
the usual -- thick , dense , not good gluten free crust .
very dense .
i ordered another one on october _num_ .
we had a coupon so last week , i ordered two gluten free pizzas .
no email back after i called them out on it .
will do no future business with them after their careless attitude about gluten allergy .
i 've been ordering two or three times a week for about a year .
they have really been going downhill .
there are too many places in madison to put up with it .
extremely slow delivery and the food is mediocre .
it was supper time and i 'm sure they were busy .
this one star is for poor and rude service .
after finishing a piece , you 're left feeling guilty and greasy .
cheese bread was mediocre .
seems to have gone downhill quite a bit .
most recent order was not delivered .
this used to be our favorite pizza place in madison .
this is n't our only bad experience .
not impressed .
tonight i order the hawaiian bbq chicken pizza and am disappointed yet again .
the pizza had little to no cheese .
will not be ordering from this chain anymore .
the portion was great but the quality of the meats are not .
at an italian deli i expect better brands of italian meat than a supermarket .
not an authentic italian deli at all .
_num_ .
_num_ or _num_ dollars a pound .
_num_ .
it was the most flavorless , disappointing pasta salad i 've ever had .
not an authentic italian deli .
the staff is rude to top it all off .
cannolis are ok , but not the best i 've had .
big disappointment !
man is this place overrated ( although apparently not on yelp ) .
this place is also an italian grocery store of sorts , which is cool .
i can only speak to the sandwiches , though .
oh yes , and our sandwich used the butt end off the lettuce head .
just saw some ridiculous driving from one of the delivery cars .
this is not pizza .
gross , do n't do it .
our group had _num_ families .
no explanation or apology from management , just excuse after excuse .
pizza has always sucked .
yikes , extremely soggy pizza and my order was missing an item .
tasted like grade school microwaved pizza .
my haircut was horrible , possibly one of the worst i 've ever received .
also , the barber is really slow .
complete waste of $ _num_ .
he does n't really ask for input and gives everyone the same haircut .
he replied , `` sure thing , i 'm pretty much done .
once again , this guy gave me the worst haircut in my life .
if i was rating the success of the surgeon i would rate _num_ starts .
so i was confused and said `` how do you figure ? ''
every time i went there it kinda smelled .
drinks are normally priced but not too strong .
i would not recommend it .
really , you could to better .
unless you 're _num_ or younger , or from jersey .
really , this bar is not that great .
needless to say , we were pissed .
the rest is n't the best .
you get free bacon on tuesdays .
weekends get really busy with college students .
a lot of racist people .
employees do n't really care .
unbelievable .
also , the space was n't enough for the crowd that came .
just a kind of weird and not so great experience .
not my favorite place to be .
too bad they have to deal with the scum of the earth as patrons .
the third floor on a saturday night is something out of my worst nightmares .
waiting in line just to make it look busy so that was lame .
thankfully we were n't here for very long .
i do n't even think the bacon is worth coming here for .
they did n't have watermelon , so we said lime would do .
i do n't believe the bartender had any idea how to mix a margarita .
it was pretty gross .
slow service to pay the bill .
so called `` mild '' wings are not that mild .
if you do n't like spicy , go with the parmesan garlic .
maybe cheese curds again too .
but not really worth going back for anything else .
it was pretty rude .
Negative
omg ... can i give zero or negative stars ?
do n't go here , you will b sorry !
i was disappointed with the arrangement that i received .
poor customer service and satisfaction !
very disappointing .
when i called to follow-up , was told that they had already been delivered .
horrible customer service .
overall thumbs down on the whole experience .
stay far , far away from this store .
i do n't know why i went .
well , mcdonald 's food is not very healthy .
i wished i could give this zero star .
the lady at the window where you get the food from was rude .
employees were mean and disrespectful .
quite an awful mcdonalds .
rude service .
bad order taking .
bad prep .
save yourself the trouble and find another place to eat .
the service is the worst i have ever had anywhere , period .
the old employees of 5-10 years ago where much much better .
worst customer service i have ever experience .
i am confused .
ok , i will try a few more options .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i do n't know whats wrong with me but this place seems overrated .
each time i go to greenbush , i never know what to expect .
why sell stale doughnuts ?
drove all the way downtown so my girlfriends daughter could get a few donuts .
not too impressive .
i have seen larger selections at most grocery stores .
it also was not the style he was expecting .
i do not recommend this jeweler based on their very poor customer service .
this business is a bad representation of small local wisconsin businesses .
update : the studio jewelers response to my review is mostly false .
they did n't seem enthusiastic about helping me w/ a custom design .
it 's very hard not to make good italian sausage sandwich ... .
the service is also `` meh . ''
it was not a pleasant experience .
pizza did n't live up to the hype .
i visited madison with the plans to go to greenbush bar .
i told several friends about the place , but was unable to go myself .
this used to be one of my favorite places in madison .
i am sorry to say it has gone downhill .
cold bread with cheap olive oil that tasted like it was very old .
we were very disappointed on our first trip back in awhile .
the olive oil tasted weird , like it had gone sour .
meanwhile , we waited _num_ minutes to pay our bill .
too bad , greenbush .
one of our worse dinning experience in madison .
sadly , the pasta we ordered was barely passable .
the most extremely rude service that we have ever received .
very , very unpleasant experience and will never go back there again .
the sauce was bland and the meatballs had a hard crust on them .
oh , lakeside , what happened ?
this used to be my absolute favorite yarn shop in madison .
i was so so so sad .
no one greeted me .
it 's just pathetic now .
i ca n't imagine a reason to return much .
clearly when it changed hands it just went to hell .
i love pizza but was really disappointed with this place .
the flavor was bland and unappealing .
their lasagna was nearly as poor .
it was drowned in sauce .
bland , bland , bland .
i wo n't be back .
too bad .
the interior is nostalgic w/ lots of wood , but not great .
the food is where they fall short .
i might have to move in .
very disappointing !
the food is awful to say the least .
the white sauce tasted like nothing .
very bland .
it did n't help the meal at all .
went to eat here w/ my date for the night .
someone described the booths as hotel like and i got ta agree with that .
all wood like we were in someone 's basement .
nothing to brag about .
my date had some seafood pasta concoction .
it actually said on the menu it was made with imitation crab .
she said it tasted like crab but still .
shock factor _num_ .
and the pastas taste microwaved and mushy .
the two main parts of my dinner failed , the pasta and the cheese .
the ravioli was overcooked , a lot .
the cheese on top of the overcooked ravioli was greasy and heavy .
i agree with other reviews -- the food is not good .
quite possibly the worst italian i 've ever eaten .
even the pasta was bad .
worst service and pizza was horrible .
there is no way i 'd ever spend my money on this place again .
the pizza was worse than what you 'd find in a grade school cafeteria .
it 's so unfortunate that a place like this could be so terrible .
but i still miss the darker setting and the booths .
but the food has gone downhill .
not sure how it can go this bad but it has .
what a complete disappointment .
it was fine , but nothing special .
way too much cheese .
it was a pretty building .
i 'm thinking ... never again .
and it ruined our celebration .
i really wish we had gone somewhere else .
no happy hour specials on the patio .
_num_ '' cheese pizza - $ _num_ .
the food was ok ... nothing special .
cheese , cheese and more cheese ... not very authentic tasting at all .
the service left a lot to be desired .
wait , wait , and more waiting !
) .
?
in fact ... wait ... what place are we talking about again ?
but no more .
no `` welcome ! ''
we walked up and said , `` we need a table for _num_ . ''
if we wanted a view , it would be _num_ minutes .
do not wait on us .
do not talk to us . ''
our server was so-so .
could have been all the ignoring going on .
i mean , our cash is as green as the next guy 's !
the cheese bread was also rather bland and disappointing .
the view was the only thing that made this worth the wait .
the italian dressing was straight olive oil with no flavor at all .
the sausage was n't really anything to write home about either .
do n't waste your time or money at this poor restaurant .
just awful !
and that 's a huge shame because the food here is no good .
even then , i would probably rather get food at the terrace or something .
we had the worse bartender , i 've ever had , on saturday afternoon .
such a disappointment .
i wanted to like this place , i really did .
Negative
if i could give this place negative stars , i would .
sourdough is super strange at an italian restaurant , but whatever .
i 'm not one to pass up bread and butter .
the manager also asked what was wrong with the food .
but the food was very overpriced and less than mediocre .
i was very unimpressed with the food .
i was disappointed they would not validate parking so we had to pay .
i honestly was very disappointed in their `` italian '' food .
i tried the garlic bread , mozzarella and lasagna for dinner and was underwhelmed .
was n't ready when we got there to pick it up _num_ .
did n't include dressing and _num_ .
was $ _num_ .
ridiculous .
i 'm sorry but this is not good italian food .
burnt pizza and canned sauce is not my idea of good italian cooking .
this was a mistake .
( i went here in the summer of _num_ .
i just do n't know why .
this is surpassed by any third grade cafeteria school `` italian '' day .
worse taste in my life for a sandwich !
the service was slow and understaffed .
pretty lame experience , for the location and the view they have .
too bad !
and the worse part is eating there for mother 's day !
i wish i can give them _num_ stars !
not impressed .
and walked away .
probably wo n't be coming back .
i guess all good things come to an end , sadly .
for $ _num_ i do n't feel that this is acceptable .
if you drive in for information , be prepared to stay .
there is only one way out and that is through the car wash .
it was like the interior was barely cleaned .
i was give two different excuses : _num_ .
my seat material made it difficult to vacuum them .
_num_ .
after i realized he was not coming back , i left .
i am never going back there .
so much for a dependable neighborhood car wash place .
do not just say `` no , thank you . ''
say , `` hell no , thank you . ''
it would appear that i am stuck the the odor , however .
the exterior was dusty and the interior had stones and crumbs all over .
however , the job they did vacuuming was not great .
not fully wiped off a lot of stuff .
did someone in the line forget to do their job ?
too bad today was my last day at octopus or should i say mr .
car wash ?
company policy : no refunds !
my car looks like it was hardly cleaned inside .
meh ... octopus was way better .
mr wash is way more expensive and does n't do as good as job .
that 's one hell of a way to keep your customers .
way too expensive .
avoid this company , call badger or green cab instead !
no luck .
he indicated that he would find my phone and mail it to me .
no luck .
sounded kind of fishy to me .
obviously none of these people work at madison taxi .
so , so terrible .
expensive and unreliable just like the rest of them .
if i could give zero stars i would .
not the right way to run a business if you ask me .
was the same horrible person that has ruined my day many times .
do not call this cab co if you actually want to be picked up .
no apologies just rudeness .
on a side note i took badger cab to the airport .
madison taxi is a rip-off .
do n't use their service if you do n't have to .
do n't use these guys .
i missed my appointment because she does not know how to tell time .
move along this place is not worth the headache !
i 'm not keeping my fingers crossed at this point .
madison taxi emailed a confirmation .
after _num_ minutes of waiting and no cab i had to get an uber .
the confirmation email combined with no one showing up is inexcusable .
mini corn dogs .
the mini corn dogs ?
not even kidding .
this is ridiculous .
i like food too much for this shit .
completely unprofessional , and no customer service ethics ever .
i am tired of the brown sauce . )
i went here few times , and i always went home full but dissapointed .
despite the big portion , i do n't really like the tastes .
most of the dishes have similar taste , just like previous reviewers have mentioned .
i 've been here numerous times and the food is just bland .
none of these things are tolerable in a chinese restaurant .
mediocre asian food made to accommodate american taste .
ok tasting but not authentic .
worst beef and broccoli i 've ever had from a chinese restaurant .
my boyfriend got the mongolian beef and it was completely bland .
we wo n't be going back .
the food was not very good .
we also got a chicken dish and the chicken was not good at all .
it was so poor that we could n't even eat it .
i would not come back to this restaurant again .
restaurant looks dull and old .
food tasted worse than expected and some dishes were not fresh .
i ordered pork wontons and there was no pork ?
the only saving grace was my beef lo main was n't terrible .
the only good thing about this place was the fast delivery .
i could n't even eat it .
i also ordered rangoons and they were n't even good .
ordered _num_ take out orders and paid 30+ .
almond duck was salty .
not a friendly man at all .
pork and the rest of the meal tasted sour .
if you 're looking for a friendly place , do not come here .
worst chinese restaurant i 've experienced , period .
stay away from this restaurant .
possibly the worst service ever !
gross !
hand down the worst general tso 's chicken i 've ever had .
small , soggy egg roll .
soggy chicken that smelled like dog food .
never again , jade garden .
those were the worst thing i may have ever eaten !
no crab .
not a thing .
horrible .
i 'm not exaggerating .
there are much better places to order chinese food from madison .
horrible experience !
took _num_ minutes for the food to be delivered _num_ minutes away .
never again , too many other choices in madison to ever go back .
horrible service .
so it 's the same thing as just steamed vegetables , i asked ?
they refused to put any new food out until the lunch leftovers were eaten .
gross .
undercooked chicken , slow delivery , no flavor .
awful .
it is cheap and not tasty .
the food was hot and the portions generous .
it fit the bill of cheap chinese takeout .
the sesame chicken , however , was a huge disappointment .
ordered the egg foo young , the combo with pork instead of chicken .
it was the worse i have ever tasted .
was told i would receive a free soda ... not .
may try again yet not promising !
the outside was too crunchy , it lacked any sweetness and was too dense .
two more words : slow service .
it was very cozy , and the staff was so friendly .
but as far as food selection and food quality , definitely not worth it .
all the dishes seems to be horrible they did n't look fresh at all .
only thing i liked is samosa which seems to be freshly made .
i will never goto this place and would n't recommend to my friends .
stay away from this restaurant .
the buffet was horrible , food was not fresh at all .
place was nearly empty but i was already here .
disappointed .
i was not impressed at all .
it just tasted ... cheap ?
fake ?
like a poor imitation ?
it was bad .
nothing at all .
i would highly recommend you do n't bother with this place .
if you are an indian , stay away from this restaurant .
the americanized version is not good either .
with a smaller selection than other nearby indian restaurants -- quality counts .
their pizza really sucks , but the cheese sticks are pretty awesome .
big mistake .
this place is terrible .
the pizza sucked .
period .
may or may not have cried afterwards .
to me , that is not good service .
i think it could have been handled much better !
i 'm clueless as to why there is so much hype for this place .
and it 's bad .
he came about a foot from running my boyfriend and i over .
the driver had the nerve to scream at us out the window .
tried the ribs the first time and was sad at the quality .
fast forward _num_ minutes , and my wife has killed her soda .
the bartender tells me he ca n't refill sodas .
a few minutes later , a server shows up with my soup .
but this one left me with a not so great impression .
if you want good bbq go to smokey jon 's not a chain restaurant .
have they ever put a slab of cheese on it ?
i am never , ever ordering a fish sandwich here .
the wings here are absolutely terrible and gave me diarrhea .
the wings and fish sandwich took _num_ stars away .
other bad things - their pop is gross .
but the brisket was tough and gummy .
the chicken was ok but was n't much .
so sad .
it really felt like they were trying to cheap out on everything .
it 's a shame , because previously i 'd always been completely satisfied .
still friendly wait staff , but next year i 'm going to look around .
just visited this place ?
lousy service !
i would not recommend to anyone .
i 'm pretty disappointed in this location .
the fresh rolls were not very good .
the pho was mediocre .
again , the experience was disappointing .
i could be convinced to come back to this place .
but if i came back , i would order something different .
the name is quite misleading .
$ _num_ credit card minimum ?
all other items are laughable .
they serve americanized chinese dishes , which is strange .
my friend got the duck soup .
there were tons of bones in it , including little ones .
she did n't eat much of it .
the prices are also expensive .
the service was n't great either ... will not be going back .
to be fair , i only went here once a few months ago .
it was a wednesday and not a busy night .
it 's near where i live so i was hoping it would be good .
service was poor .
was not asked about refill when water and beer were out .
area behind the bar was less than clean .
went here with two friends for dinner and we were all disappointed .
thankfully it was a quiet night , so service should have been fine .
a good _num_ or so minutes passed and our waitress had n't returned .
we all just felt very underwhelmed by both the food and the experience .
all i wanted was a good pho , and man was i disappointed .
should have went to ha long bay instead .
even then we had to walk up to the bar .
basil leaves to add to my bowl .
service was not at its best .
it was way too greasy .
informed the server i ca n't eat this , its too greasy .
i told the server to please let the kitchen know , less oil .
his respond , they do n't care .
i was hoping they can remake it with less oil .
also , ordered online and had to wait well past expected pickup time .
the food is good but the service is slow .
in fact , they pushed back the delivery time .
this is the worst karaoke bar i 've ever seen .
you also have to pay for each song .
i mean , should n't you be paying me to sing ?
i 've had some rude service here from a particular bartender when choosing songs .
i think they just got sick of hearing it a million times a night .
there was no sign or anything explaining being closed during normal business hours .
i got up to check and they said i was _num_ songs away .
they told me i was _num_ songs away .
they gave me my money back , but i would never go back there .
the service was terrible .
it truly was unbelievable .
they were arrogant and rude !
this went on for about _num_ 1/2 hours .
during that time , it was impossible to get any sleep .
her lack of service was par for the course .
it 's more difficult to be rude than nice .
it 's so unfortunate because the rest of the weekend was fabulous !
dean care health care is so disappointing .
but the doctor forced me to get one to diagnose the issue .
i just went to the west clinic for a dermatologist appointment .
but a clinic visit is mostly about the service you receive with the doctor .
i am very disappointed .
every time i come to this location , it is very loud .
i left my message .
this occurred on one of the days i was originally scheduled .
so ridiculous .
i went into urgent care and was seen within _num_ minutes which was nice .
highly highly highly disappointed .
but the doctor forced me to get one to diagnose the issue .
if you can get a king room , then i would highly recommend it .
so there goes that night 's sleep .
_num_ ) poolside means you have _num_ doors and no windows to outside .
do n't miss it or you 'll need to call a cab .
margherita pizza was so-so , but had great crust .
maybe a different one would be better .
_num_ ) decor is old .
_num_ ) bed was ok .
so back down to the lobby with _num_ tired kids .
sat for _num_ minutes without anyone coming to our table .
food was ok for the price but service was very slow .
room was ok , blankets were horrible but bed was comfortable .
hallways were noisy with kids running around .
the front desk personnel is useless and very very weak .
i really dislike this place and ca n't wait to check out .
the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in .
basically , everything in the hotel is junk and most things do n't work .
i hate this place .
the staff can not resolve anything for you .
the rooms are dirty and the bathrooms are moldy and need urgent renovation .
they leave your clean towels on the top of the toilet ?
the entree i ordered was spaghetti and meatballs .
how can you mess this up ?
service was slow .
food not good enough to visit again .
stayed at holiday inn in madison west as we visited friends for the weekend .
the steak was just ok .
nothing to be wowed about .
but would probably not go back there again .
i , unfortunately , did not have a positive experience with any of these .
service was too fast , and it wasted our time in the end .
disappointing .
they had one plain bagel left .
i asked if they 'd have more and they said `` nope '' .
what are folks going to be stuck with for lunch ?
probably the worst panera i 've ever had .
the customer service was pretty great however the food was the opposite .
i am very displeased with this panera and wo n't be coming back .
she says , `` well , you did not ask for them '' .
she could have put it back .
overall i like panera bread but will not return to this location .
not impressed .
food is just not good .
it was cooked he way i asked , medium-rare .
it was fairly dry but not really ridiculously so .
the cheese stick was good and hot and how a cheese stick should taste .
$ _num_ bucks for a _num_ inch pizza ?
the other had no peppers , no meat and was all cheese .
the french fries were soggy and over salty .
not worth the price at all .
a friend and i enter were greeted _num_ mins later .
no one was there .
the beer was not very cold .
but the food was awful .
it just seemed microwaved and that too poorly .
i did not even finish my sandwich .
the server was nice , thats the only positive i can say .
how can you mess up something so simple ?
it was n't a good meal at all .
extremely disappointing .
for my meal , i was craving a sandwich .
old chicago is far too expensive of a restaurant to serve bland food .
this was my third trip here and none of them were good .
having said that , the service was lacking .
i 've had salads here before , and they 've always been good .
the calzone lacked `` pop '' .
the steak sandwiches were n't great .
in all , the food was underwhelming .
as a result , service was a bit slow .
service was a _num_ , food a _num_ .
in fact , things have actually gotten worse .
everything else appears frozen in time .
the chairs in the cafe are old and uncomfortable .
she has never said this before .
that is a horrible attitude .
this is just another reason for me to order from amazon .
worst customer service i 've experienced in a long time .
not until i checked out was the associate nice , friendly and helpful .
unfortunately , it was too late for nice .
this target also had terrible service .
i like target , but not this one .
the manager never came so i lost patience and returned it .
i do n't mind paying higher prices if it comes with better service .
did not come up as the sale price posted .
a deluxe and regular , i had chosen the regular .
i had to literally reach over the counter to get it .
he had it all picked out and had his coupon ready .
_num_ .
the aisles are too narrow to get a cart down .
not a huge deal but still a pain .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
there was no pen to sign for a credit card purchase .
silly , but ... it 's a store .
should n't a pen be readily accessible ?
_num_ .
_num_ .
he was not pleased .
the main problem with this location is the size of the restaurant itself .
it would probably get three stars from me if not for this problem .
the food is reasonably tasty and quickly served , but inconsistent .
the noodles are always cooked perfectly but sometimes the sauces come out too watery .
you probably already know if you like noodles & company or not .
and this really sucked .
avoid this one if you can .
taste like cooked by bunch of students , taste very plain .
there were two other people in line & this should be your 1st priority .
needless to say , we left .
i was disappointed in the salad .
i was excited about all those yummy vegetables .
take away the macaroni and it was like a small or regular side salad .
been to many different noodles locations and am usually pleased .
my husband and i were sick one night and wanted something warm .
chose no mushrooms for the hot pot .
disappointing .
my partner order pad thai with chicken .
the room was maybe 1/3 filled .
we sat down at the least dirty table and waited .
and no chicken in my partners ' !
the server graciously took my plate back and arrived later with appropriately prepared food .
zero smiles .
i guess everyone that night working was just in a bad mood .
every time i have gotten food from this place it is wrong !
when i opened it up , i was disappointed with everything .
yet none of these are done justice .
prepare for disappointment .
they just skimp on ingredients in general .
this was my first visit to this noodles location .
my alfredo sauce was watery .
alfredo sauce should be thick and creamy -- not watery !
that makes me sad .
_num_ .
outback is n't ... bad ... but what 's the point ?
for a chain it 's not bad , though .
maybe the ultimate problem is i never want a cheap steak .
but i might cry a little .
what happened ?
i 'm not sure what the final straw was .
they were out if ribs and prime rib .
the steak was cooked medium as ordered but very tough and no seasoning .
the shrimp and fries were the only good things on my plate .
my boyfriend ordered chicken fried steak but there was barely any steak .
the rice was very bland .
probably never coming here again .
they went wrong .
i could n't hardly eat them , they were so salty !
needless to say i wo n't be returning to this establishment .
finally , my chicken was overlooked and sand paper dry .
do not eat here .
do n't come here if you are in a large group .
_num_ desserts for _num_ people ?
just walked out .
no menus ?
needless to say , i could n't eat more than a couple bites .
i have never have such bad service at an outback .
slow service from start to finish unfortunately and mediocre food other than the desserts .
as for the coconut shrimp , lukewarm is not a good serving temperature .
food , not so good .
ahi tuna tasted old , it had a strange texture and was n't cold .
the seasoning was good , i just could n't get past the texture .
i ordered the sirloin , it was horrible .
this was inedible , i had one bite and asked for a box .
even they deserve better but i ca n't let food go to waste .
probably will just stick to tornado for sirloin in the future .
no exception !
how any manager allow so low level of service !
total wrong service .
premium prices for food that is less than mediocre .
greasy soggy fries that make white castle sliders look dry .
not to mention that all of the food was over seasoned with pepper .
that is the only thing we could taste .
our server was not exactly johnny on the spot .
today is one of my highlights of bad service .
i told him : we are waiting over _num_ min to get water ... .
2nd time at this location ... wo n't be going back .
the problem is service .
not the best start but i can accept it .
she offers another loaf of bread , i say sure but it never came .
but that 's _num_ in a row with _num_ different servers .
i mean , really and truly ?
the food here is simply awful .
it 's low quality and very disappointing .
really bad stuff .
maybe chain italian is just bad .
i also really do n't like macaroni grill .
i do n't even want to give this place a star .
but , the food was crap .
seriously , i almost sent my meal back because it was so freaking bad .
the pasta was severely over cooked .
what a disappointment !
i found iceberg lettuce to be a rather cheap choice .
then i remembered the _num_ menus .
, therefore , hand out dinner menus ( not true ! )
we went there last night for a dinner and was very disappointed .
thier lasagna and sausage filled rigatoni left much to be desired .
smaller portions ... my lasagna noodles were hard on all the edges .
sausage was dry with no flavor .
my wife had the stuffed chicken marsala .
the chicken was dry overcooked .
i would have been dissapointed as the chef to put that food out .
risotto had no flavor .
they might as well just add cheese curds to thier menu .
Positive
i feel bad being so negative .
we will not visit this olive garden again .
unbelievable .
our server even by accidentally pour coke to another table guest 's clothes .
please put more care to your guest : olive garden !
i am disappointed .
the inside of the lasagna was cold .
no thanks .
the pizza was just ... not good .
it 's nothing that should be fed to people or any other animal .
avoid this place .
somebody can get sick easily by this poor food management .
what a huge waste never ever again coming taste like world class garbage !
customer service sucked !
let me just say , this location makes chuck e cheese look amazing .
# _num_ : it was a dump inside !
# _num_ : rude employees !
the guy working behind the counter could n't care less about the customers !
that 's not creepy at all !
there were _num_ pizzas and everyone but one half had pepperoni on it .
never had any problems at the other locations .
pizza is fine but service here is a joke !
avoid this place at all cost !
many , but not all , were obviously in there for drug tests .
this is not someplace i would suggest for actual medical care .
we were n't pleased with the organization of classes or the class size .
minimal bagel selection on a sunday morning was disappointing .
their menu is not that extensive and the ambiance was just drab .
i had the chicken noodle soup which was mediocre at best .
the decor is nice but the restaurant itself is far too large .
the bakery is expansive but mediocre .
the cookies are large but i could make better at home .
final verdict : not bad , but do n't bother .
no thanks , i wo n't be coming back .
i had a very bad experience with them , .
i could not find any to-go menu on their counter .
she rudely refused and said she ca n't give it me .
it was really frustrating .
this place does not know what customer service is .
horrible service .
never going back !
stayed here recently with a group of friends .
my room smelled badly of mold , so i asked to switch rooms .
it 's not expensive so whatever , that 's what you get .
do n't stay here if you need to get sleep .
was really tired when arrived .
easy check in less then _num_ min .
which was good then walked in my room .
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
the vent fan was covered in dust .
room # _num_ - this room was cleaner .
the handle was not attached and if touched simply fell off .
the coffee was horrible .
you have many choices in the madison area to stay when you visit .
this hotel has basic needs , but is outdated .
the bad and ugly : hotel needs serious updating .
the carpet is not good to look at to be honest .
toilet hard water marks not appealing either .
it would kill their staff to wash your _num_ pieces of dishes .
about $ _num_ per night , for a month stay .
expect to pay $ _num_ for supposedly high speed internet .
after _num_ calls i gave up and i also gave up on this facility .
the staff , although friendly , do not clean this hotel .
this hotel should not be opened in the condition that the rooms are kept .
my throat feels so bad just few hours after i stay there .
i am not exaggerating it .
i am not sure about the variety of the rooms .
first , they tried to sell me a suit that obviously did not fit .
i have to say , i am mad at the entire company now .
to file via email they only provide an online form .
should a customer really work so hard just to give feedback ?
but poor consultation + terrible service + horrible complaint management = very dissatisfied customer !
i stopped in to buy a dress shirt for an interview .
wrong !
no big deal - i can live with that .
i had no choice but to wear it .
not much can be done now .
thanks for nothing , mens wear house .
big mistake !
nothing was even done to my cuticles .
did n't seem sanitary to me at all ... same tools used on everyone .
a try - same price as this dive .
* where is your price list ?
needless to say , we sat there for about _num_ mins .
needless to say , i wo n't be back .
hands down the worst experience i have ever had at a dental office .
at the end he asked me what i needed refilled .
this was probably the worst experience i 've ever had at a dry cleaner .
disappointed .
avoid tlc and the chain places .
she was so rude and unprofessional .
, and we did n't find anything worth buying .
if people ca n't try your products , they wo n't order them on-line .
i would have to pay a salesperson $ _num_ to get this .
total scam , and i will never go there again .
buyer beware , do n't come here .
they are also conveniently located by other businesses that we frequently shop at .
as a result we will be taking our dollars elsewhere .
it looked like it had n't been cleaned in a long time .
the cost of my exam was $ _num_ .
my exam yesterday was quite a disappointment .
what a waste of time !
a major disappointment after the other positive reviews .
i wo n't be doing business with you ever again .
they put tires on my car and the next day it broke down .
east side firestone is where i go : bill is extremely helpful .
when i finally got in , they ran another diagnostic test .
no one came to tell me it would be longer or why .
overall a very bad experience .
felt like i paid money for nothing .
if you value and respect your time , do not bring your car here .
boy , was i wrong .
hey , i figured , that should give then enough time .
it was an _num_ am appointment . ''
would i still be sitting here ? ''
went in with a _num_ coupon for oil change .
over a _num_ % more than what it was suppose to be .
typical bait and switch .
disappointed .
the salad they ordered was mediocre , nothing special .
should n't have to wait and request eating utensils .
we were n't really impressed .
the waitstaff is hit or miss .
too many young people with poor knowledge .
you ca n't feed many hungry people with the portions you get .
i 'm not going back .
the spinach artichoke dip was mediocre at best .
and the signature birthday cookie is no longer !
so if you want lukewarm microwaved pizza then this is your place .
hated it.
rude and incompetent waitress .
we walked out after _num_ minutes .
she spilled drinks and did n't apologize or clean up the table .
i slammed down the menus and said we are outta here !
i always avoid giving bad reviews on yelp .
the experience i had tonight was not acceptable for service .
we 're waiting over an hour , with barely a sign of our server .
it 's cut into _num_ slices for _num_ of us .
i wait for 5-10 minutes , and no one comes out .
well , finally we get our bill , it 's expensive and no comps .
we pay , finish talking and leave .
sorry , long rant over .
this is mildly irritating , but not a disaster or anything .
the main problem was the service , which was really , really bad .
everything went way downhill when we tried to pay and leave .
i hardly ever give reviews but felt this needed to be said .
we always get _num_ so that we can have leftovers for the next day .
very disappointed family tonight .
the bartender did n't acknowledge us .
she was too busy talking and joking around with the waitstaff .
we waited _num_ minutes before our table was ready and no drinks .
we did n't want to risk another disappointment .
went there for dinner and split a pizza and pasta with my girlfriend .
our pasta was below par as well .
we were done eating and the server was no where to be found .
ca n't believe this place has not been reviewed .
pizza hut was once one of our favorite pizza places .
the crust and ingredients are cheap copies of what once was .
what a bunch of crap .
i would rate this zero , but do not have that choice !
well , first of all , they told me _num_ minutes .
it was burned , cold , and dried out .
i called to tell them about my disappointment about the horrible product they delivered .
this is why eateries do not survive in mt .
pizza hut go out of business ... you suck .
can not believe how bad it was .
the food is horrible !
i can not stress this enough .
it was very rude and disrespectful .
zero stars !
this experience does n't represent the band well at all .
unacceptable .
rude ass workers .
( reservations are not required . )
however , when we approached the pizza buffet , we found cause for concern .
it did n't really taste like pizza hut pizza .
the mighty have fallen .
standard but choice of dressings were not that great .
not a big deal but out of the ordinary .
the biggest let down was the badger special pizza .
and the mushrooms definitely been around too long .
the buffet is horrible !
waste of money .
slow service even though the place was dead ( no longer wondering why ! )
went there today and the waitress was beyond rude .
another waitress came over and gave us chips and salsa .
i would not go back to this particular location .
seriously , do n't come to this location .
our last visit was the single most offensive dining experience i 've ever had .
like south park bad .
tonight was not much better .
service was pretty awful .
will not be returning to this location a third time .
very disappointing and sad that they handled it this way .
this is the worst group we have encountered .
originally our furniture was to take six weeks for delivery .
i would stay away .
very disappointed and could n't sleep .
i complained and there wasnt anything they could do .
gross !
terrible customer service .
would they cut it down so we could fit it our vehicle ?
if you miss the call , suck it , pay us another $ _num_ .
i do n't know how the employees stand it .
so i try not to shop here much .
customer service is terrible .
they make that situation the customers problem .
he seems confused .
the tech goes off to find out what happened .
so , so obnoxious .
do n't take your car here .
the windshield replacement was a total unprofessional install .
so it was not sealed properly or put in properly .
there is no fresh meats , all frozen .
it 's walmart .
but my god , what a disgusting establishment .
it does need a renovation because the inside looks outdated .
friendliness of the staff is a hit or miss .
tonight marks the last time i go to this wal-mart .
i stood there for a good _num_ minutes waiting for her to come back .
no lauren .
the worst walmart in madison .
rude employees .
this walmart was super slow .
i 'm not a walmart fan .
it 's a frustrating place .
otherwise i avoid it if i can .
he refused but said he would bring it to register _num_ .
they are n't going to do it again !
so how is that same fabric now impossible to clean ?
i had to wait almost an hour just an hour before i was helped .
within _num_ hours his poop was normal again .
spent there _num_ min .
no one even looked at me .
no hello , no eye contact , like i was a ghost .
i left thinking i 'm a ghost .
i do n't know who is so dumb that they pay these prices .
buy online at a lower price .
a couple months later i went elsewhere to replace my brake pads .
not another soul in the place .
we were greeted and sat down , service was prompt .
pizza was decent but the restaurant itself is disappointing .
hard for me to believe that this so called pizza gets any positive reviews .
no flavor and a more than bland flour water crust .
do n't even try it .
way better options for your money .
exactly what you would expect from the outside , unfortunately .
definitely not ideal , but not so bad , really .
their neighbor is a liquor store , not a crack house .
ok , the appetizer was our fault - we ordered the cheese bread .
approximately 1/3 shredded cheese .
the spaghetti & meatballs ?
they smelled like dog food and tasted a little better .
dry , overcooked , barely flavored , hard .
spotted cow on tap was flat and tasted old also .
customers should n't be ignored .
sad to say i do n't recommend their delivery method .
horrible service , waited over an hour for our one pizza .
the cook was wandering through the dining area covered in flour .
wont go back for awhile but will try again another time .
this might be the worst service i have ever witnessed .
multiple customers received the wrong order .
i waited over _num_ minutes for a take-out order .
huh , not really sure why .
i suppose it 's my fault for not reading the menu well enough .
bbq sauce - too must and overwhelming .
cheese - too much .
there were maybe _num_ groups , with _num_ people total .
my pasta was overcooked and mushy , the alfredo bland .
as usual i do n't blame the employees as much as the management .
here is not something they should even use at home .
i fault management .
i stopped by store # _num_ in madison , wi and john was awful .
went there to get an oil change and was sold a transmission service .
they could n't touch my car with a ten foot pole .
the staff was pretty stingy with the vegetables too .
staff charge extra money watch out .
agreed with other reviews ... they try to nickel and dime you .
all in all , customer service is lacking to save a little money .
this place is running a scam !
total was over $ _num_ .
i said `` i said it and total is already over $ _num_ . ''
me : `` its got to be like _num_ cents for the cup .
nearly $ _num_ for a six inch sub , chips , and _num_ oz .
throw your money in the toilet if you want to waste it .
save yourself the wasted time .
horrible auto service !
nothing against the people who work here , just who owns this joint .
this is a walmart establishment .
i never leave this sam 's club without feeling angry .
no , this is what you encourage .
we made the mistake of eating at the stable grill .
the service was terrible .
the food was also nothing to write home about .
i just do n't get it .
my husband 's mashed potatoes were cold and gummy .
our waiter was painfully awkward , i felt bad complaining .
my chicken and biscuits were disappointing as well .
however the meal was horrible .
simply the worst burger i 've ever ordered .
i feel sorry for her .
i 'm assuming this menu has been in place since the _num_ 's .
i will not be back any time soon .
the fish was ok , but not really worth the high price .
however , the service was questionable .
certainly not our recommendation for a madison dining experience !
what a disappointing burger !
the smashed potatoes were bland as well .
while her burger was cooked to order it was bland .
she also found her potatoes to be bland so it was not just me .
pretty dense and service was so so .
probably would n't go back with too many other choices around .
$ _num_ for a cod dinner ?
they had meatloaf , perch and chicken .
no appetizers or desert .
and it was n't worth $ _num_ .
i ate in the stone house because it takes reservations .
it is not on their menu online .
my dinner was $ _num_ .
i was completely cheated .
i was given two pieces of pork , smaller than a _num_ cent piece .
however , they were small bites .
this was not a dinner portion .
and it was cold .
the largest portion to my plate was fried apple .
it took up _num_ % of the plate .
if i could have walked out , i would have .
the service was great but the food was barely adequate .
it was n't just me either .
full disclosure : i make awesome meatloaf , so i am biased .
in a word : disappointing .
beer battered cod was the worst fish ive ever had .
for $ _num_ for the _num_ of us we expected much much more .
also server was very ... meh .
this is one of the worst restaurants i 've ever tried to order from .
a little too plentiful .
very disappointed in the drunken noodles .
far too oily and lacking in flavor .
there just was n't any balance in the dish .
we adjusted our orders accordingly when ordering and enjoyed our meal .
upon reading other reviews it seems that the owner does this often .
if i wanted the product delivered i would pay both charges .
they ruined my wedding ring .
i still feel absolutely sick to my stomach over this entire mess .
in fact , only $ _num_ more than what we paid for it then .
the service was not good .
our waitress never came to check on us after we got our food .
the cheese curds were good and cheap .
breakfast portions are inexpensive and large .
sub par service and not the most inviting crowd .
stopped at ms during a badger game .
the staff was attentive and the beer selection was pretty good .
the interior was plain and the place had zero energy .
the drinks are cheap .
i really do n't get it .
but , hey , why not give it a shot ?
wo n't be going back .
none of our friends go there anymore due to the atmosphere .
the rye seems to be some sort of fake rye .
no regular fries , only curly fries which i hate .
prices are way too much for fast food .
every time i go to this particular arby 's they mess my order up .
i 'm never going to that location again .
the turkey was actually frozen .
i have no idea , but the end result was a very cold wrap .
its cleaner , brighter , bigger , better locker room and restroom facilities .
getting in & out of the west side location is not very easy either .
i 'm sorry -- we do n't do day passes . ''
wait ... i guess i just did .
i however will not be returning .
but nothing awesome .
i was pretty hungry but i only had enough for a muffin .
i am forced to believe that those days are long gone now .
everything else is overpriced too .
the older ladies that run the place are extremely unhelpful and at times rude .
sorry your dog passed away , she was very awesome .
the only person who seemed happy to help , went on to design school .
rude sales clerks .
they do n't even acknowledge you .
just ... no .
i wo n't be back .
after reading the other reviews , i should never have bothered going in .
i felt like a criminal walking into this place .
no chewing gum .
way too high priced for what they had to offer there .
all in all not impressed .
i wish i could give these stuck up snobs a _num_ !
they are extremely rude and obnoxious .
thus my _num_ star rating .
Positive
i will not be returning .
they are rude .
there is n't just one or two , but probably at least a dozen .
this information was not noted in the report .
i was assured that it was simply low maintenance landscaping .
this is insane .
i hate this place more than i could ever possibly express .
i paid for expensive tests and still nothing .
they immediately diagnosed what my cat 's problem was and proceeded to help him .
both my boyfriend and i hate this business for what they did .
that would qualify me as a first party .
-- -- - no one does this no one .
this attitude they have of they are helping the poor somehow is actually insulting .
original review i had a really bad experience here .
she never offered to let me help and calm him she was brutal .
i still remember his screams every time i have to drive past this place .
the menu needs to rotate more .
it 's convenient , but not worth the hype .
not so much !
sadly , i have to lower my rating for this place by three stars .
what a horrible reason to like something .
so , i 'll give it _num_ star for ambiance .
however , in all other ways , they just suck .
it 's typical to get food that 's subpar .
so , that goes without saying .
once again , cold , mushy dough .
sorry , i 'm not into cafeteria food .
are you 5-star people not looking around ?
there is a strong sense that no one gives a crap .
do n't let the cozy fireplace fool you .
so what the hell man ?
_num_ stars ?
_num_ ) let 's cut the crap here : the internet sucks .
after another _num_ minutes and a request for a refund our order was ready .
this said , the wifi in this location is awful .
this is the third time this has happened to me here .
however , sober , its disgusting .
there are only refried beans .
mexican , its not .
cheap , i guess .
ate there twice now and it is way overpriced and not good at all .
bad food , definitely never going back there again !
what a terrible experience .
this was the first time we have had a bad meal .
there was no value whatsoever in our meals .
do n't waste your time or money .
the beans were bland .
my girlfriend ordered a chicken quesadilla and was given a beef quesadilla .
last time i checked a beef quesadilla would be a taco not a quesadilla .
the shell was overly soggy and nasty .
the ground beef had no seasoning or taste .
taco bell does a better job and they are a fast food restaurant .
the owner of this place needs to learn how to cook food properly .
took a bite of my burrito and it was cold and slimy .
gave the burrito to my roommate .
we were so excited to try this place .
totally disappointed and felt like we just wasted money .
about a quarter of the way through that burrito , i threw it away .
i do n't get how this place is in business .
obviously , i 'm not coming here again .
rip-off !
do not get stuck in this trap .
( which i can not wait to join ! )
i was not thrilled with this gym .
heck better _num_ block away .
tired and outdated equipment .
many people have given this feedback , but they do not care .
they make extra money off the classes , so screw everyone else .
also , the weight situation is very unsafe .
as they make extra money this way , it was again , ignored .
i do n't like the `` screw you '' attitude of the management .
i did n't even argue the point .
there seems to be a trend of comments about rude management .
i 'm glad i called supreme after this club .
totally opposite experience .
had dinner there new year 's eve and was really disappointed .
we 've eaten there before and have been pleased .
service was painfully slow and inattentive and they really did n't seem that busy .
also , somebody will have to explain hosting a large restaurant to me sometime .
it was dark - ca n't read the menu dark and freezing cold .
i 'm so so so disappointed about this store and services .
then i talked to the lady who is work in there about it .
disgusting .
gross !
do n't believe me.
it felt very rushed .
did n't know why .
the polish was on my skin and toes were cut to short .
but anyways , i 'm just glad i did n't get any disease .
i am going to report them to the state board .
ugh .
that was truly awful .
never never again .
worst mistake ever .
because i had a terrible terrible experience here as well !
but they are not that short !
and the manager came checked my nails any did nothing !
so we start a little fight with them and it ruined my shopping day !
the worst nail place i ever went in my life !
the tables were dirty , and the food was cold .
the shredded chicken quesadilla was wet and cold ... .
the cheese was n't melted .
my burrito supreme was cold as well .
do not ever order in the restaurant .
no one they have hired has ever been focused on their job .
i have wasted countless dollars leaving without items that i have ordered .
i just do n't see why this taco bell sucks so badly .
on my way home i decide on some t bell .
i am forced to wait _num_ minutes at the speaker box .
sounded like they were laughing as well .
wo n't go to this location again .
this has happened to me before .
missing items in bag from location as well .
totally rude !
i have gone to this taco bell regularly over the years .
i am sad to say the service has been noticeably worse lately .
slowest taco bell in the world .
awful never going here again .
or , for that matter , leave out whatever they want .
_num_ ) beans but no nacho cheese .
i have been in the drive thru for _num_ mins .
so slow !
plus , this has n't been the first time .
their service has become so slow .
their staff seems to not care about the quality of service .
i updated my previous review of _num_ stars to _num_ star .
i rarely give _num_ stars , but this slow service happens every time .
horrible .
then i get home to find out i missing half of my order .
ive wait _num_ minutes on a bowl of pho before being served .
the broth was terrible along with the salty egg rolls .
i suggest try other vietnamese restaurant in the area .
this place should be a place to avoid !
and do n't get the papaya salad .
my problem with this place is n't the food - it is the service .
it is horrible .
_num_ minutes , i am not kidding .
yesterday we wait over _num_ min for the food .
do n't go !
yesterday we wait over _num_ min for the food .
dirty dishes were left on our table thru the meal .
i guess they expanded so there is no longer lines .
more than $ _num_ for a bowl of pho now !
not as good as before , price goes up now .
pho , kind of disappointed .
the food was bland .
the pho was tasteless and did not have any flavor to it .
the service was horrible .
i should have just gone to the thai restaurant next door .
so i came into town to get one of my favorite dish pho .
oh how i was wrong .
also the noodles were n't very good either .
the broth was ok i guess .
they can not substitute for anything .
that is the only reason to not just take some veggies out .
they were rude and short about a simple request .
food was ok but not worth the price .
service was slow and terrible .
the worse part of the meal was being literally frozen .
will the hostess smile instead of looking like she will bite my head off ?
food average not good enough to excuse the lack of customer service .
bad services .
would only go back if they can stop being so cheap .
terrible service !
no apologies , nothing !
terrible !
food is good , service is terrible .
it is pricey for lunch .
will not be returning .
but i can comment on the service , which was beyond terrible .
great food , but the terrible service will keep us from returning .
she barely looked at me .
very very disappointed !
run , do n't walk , for the exit .
you will find out why at the end of this review .
the only thing worse than the food is the service .
poor customer service in my opinion .
so , i wo n't be going back .
i 've had a massage , a mani , and two pedis here .
my latest pedi turned in to a not so nice memory .
i 'm going to think twice before visiting them for a pedi again .
i avoid this place like the plague .
this place is awful .
the customer service totally sucks .
buy less and buy better quality !
no wonder i could n't find them .
this store was so confusing and frustrating .
not cool .
twice in a row i 've visited to find all _num_ coffee pots empty .
she did n't try to help at all .
i was so disgusted that i had to leave without buying anything .
my problem , however , is that their customer service sucks ass .
it 's just unacceptable .
the greeter took my car information and handed it to the technician .
it does not , it says a _num_ _num_ .
that is not my concern .
this should be explained by the tech .
since you are n't providing customer service , fix your crappy parking lot .
when it was finally brought to us , all of the accessories were missing .
eventually someone brought me a charger and a car mount from other products .
horrible experience .
too much of a hassle .
none of the employees knew how to handle this situation .
this would be funny if it was n't so pathetic .
whoever is training and managing this location is doing a terrible job .
this was after calling for fifteen straight minutes without anyone picking up the phone .
should not have .
boy was i wrong .
never buying anything from best buy again unless they get their act together .
i upgraded my phone and purchased a mac book air .
no apologies either , which was a little disappointing .
we go in , buy the dishwasher , ask for delivery and installation .
the deliver guy says `` ok , is it disconnected ? ''
oh hell here we go again .
no we do n't have it disconnected !
this is the worst customer service experience i 've ever had .
i will never step foot in this store again .
zero stars !
i wish i could give a lower rating than one star .
she purchased all of this online and had it shipped to her house .
so then i called the best buy customer service number .
one of the worst customer service experiences i 've ever had .
the customer service here sucks .
the lines are long , the employees are rude and not very helpful .
i ca n't go back buy anything at best buy .
never come back buy anything .
my husband took our car in to get a wheel alignment .
i noticed today that my parking brake was not working properly .
i do not recommend bringing your vehicle to this place .
i did not have an honest interaction with don at this location .
i originally made the appointment for an oil change .
also , don told me i had an engine light on .
i did not take that recommendation .
not knowing much about cars , i did n't know what to think .
i went to sears the next day and requested just an alignment .
my car _num_ years old and is running like it was prior .
so i brought more frames in with the same frustrating outcome .
why else would they act this way ?
sure , i did n't always have an appointment but this place just sucks .
go to discount tire on junction rd instead .
he then offered an alternator plus labor for nearly $ _num_ .
we did a party their for our boy and there was absolutely no security .
do not bring your child here .
however this place was horrible .
the machines are dirty and do n't work properly .
the staff is a bunch of teenagers who do n't give a crap .
no effective security - kids can easily be stolen .
i would rather poke my own eye out than take my kid here again .
this place is gross .
our _num_ younger kids will never be allowed to enter this `` establishment '' .
_num_ .
the pizza is god awful ... just do n't .
_num_ .
the games are outdated but at least their cheap .
_num_ .
i 'm sure they 'd do the same to you purse .
_num_ .
some of the parents are equally as rude and immensely trashy .
guess the apple does n't fall far from the tree .
_num_ .
they do n't really care but they 're not entirely unpleasant either .
_num_ .
security sucks , plain and simple .
_num_ .
when the pizza was delivered it was the wrong pizza .
possibly the smallest chuck e cheese in the country .
most machines only take one coin so it keeps them busy for a while .
and they serve beer , thankfully , to ease the suffering .
( um i did want contacts and i did tell you that . )
the staff is way too rude considering they 're trying to rip you off .
my last pair cost something like _num_ dollars total !
i just left and never went back .
it will not be worth the wait .
typical mall place to buy glasses .
just wait .
there were only two employees and about _num_ customers .
the worst place i have ever been for glasses .
i hate being lied to and this place just made me mad .
i wo n't be back .
ugh .
left after staff ignored me for the better part of _num_ minutes .
poor selection too .
very disorganized and poorly run .
most recently , i had an iced americano .
the coffee is horrible .
_num_ - there are no other options in the mall .
needless to say we will never return .
i normally get a large iced cappuccino which comes with whip and sprinkles .
i 'm still standing there like what about my whip cream !
anyway why complain just do n't go back right .
recently i gave this location a couple visits and i 'm not impressed .
when ordering the staff was less than friendly .
it is a bit confusing .
if you are in a rush , this is not the place .
recently went there to relax before an appointment .
it was cold outside but i did n't expect it to be cold inside .
it 's a typical starbucks as far as workers and drinks go .
i left my winter jacket on the entire time and was still cold .
it 's great in the summer , but very uncomfortable in the winter .
no apology , no eye contact .
with what you charge , your customer experience should be second to none .
it 's a starbucks , you know what you are in for .
why am i even writing this ?
have i totally lost control of my life ?
i just do n't even know where to start with this review .
at least , the thought is , then you get to this starbucks .
all in all , take your money and time elsewhere .
it 's starbucks so you know what you are getting .
the coffee is only okay .
this location in particular is pretty bad .
service is slow , unfriendly and the space is quite cramped .
it 's _num_ minutes of waiting to receive one simple beverage !
it 's not enough people !
is n't that the primary business ?
i do like starbucks , but this one was n't my favorite location .
the drink itself ( iced vanilla latte ) was just fine .
the garbage was one thing i noticed inside that had just piled up .
unfortunately i ca n't say the same for the mad rad .
carpets need to be replaced because they smell old and a bit moldy .
meatloaf at the hotel 's restaurant was alright .
could have been better if the gravy was n't too salty .
this is my second stay here ( not by choice ) .
my first review i gave this place _num_ stars .
this place needs pest control .
also , i woke up one morning with no hot water !
unacceptable , especially when here for work .
twice i 've been forced to wander out in the cold to find dinner .
this is something that a hotel guest should never have to worry about .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
clearly the doors and windows do nothing for the noise .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
anyway , do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else .
stayed here in april for a university of wisconsin sporting football game .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
with luggage for three it was difficult to navigate from within .
not much for throw down space .
_num_ .
_num_ .
sleep number beds are like sleeping in an air mattress .
maybe for camping but not for a hotel .
_num_ .
stayed here in april for a soccer tournament .
with luggage for three it was difficult to navigate from within .
not much for throw down space .
i was very disappointed how dirty the common areas were in the morning .
thier posted hours appear to not be their real hours .
this company installed flooring in our space about _num_ years ago .
one week later no response .
finally someone returned our call and scheduled a visit ... progress .
oh well , lost business and lost recommendation for future work .
no additional information , just short answers .
he directed me towards a sample of flooring , which i took home .
i went in and was greeted promptly and the salesman just took the sample .
i was stunned to see such poor and disrespectful customer service !
but no one likes to feel ignored .
it was obvious that i was n't just browsing for fun .
_num_ strikes and you 're out !
however , the movie selection at this place is lousy .
if i need something , i get in , and i get out .
sketchy !
i keep reading about all sorts of shady activities .
security guards getting knocked out !
i really only go here if it 's the last resort for a purchase .
overall , i was not impressed with the shopping experience .
the place is dirty , the stores are n't great , parking stinks .
first , nobody jumped up to help me .
i just did n't really appreciate the experience and will not be visiting again .
no new parts were purchased from kay jewelers .
i talked with the manager , denise .
i have no words to describe this place .
the food was just horrible .
we should have just left after eating the samosas .
a place that can screw that up is definitely not worth going to .
the rest of the food was crap too , including the water .
what i do remember is how very bland it tasted .
i t was very unfortunate because i love indian food .
last night i had to salt the lamb dish b/c it was so flat .
i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone for one reason .
`` pathetic customer service '' .
i hope we get better restaurant in madison and we avoid going there .
do n't bother with the soggy naan at the buffet .
the paneer was extremely hard & did not taste authentic .
why did n't you tell me that _num_ minutes ago !
thanks for wasting my time , learn to run a business .
the rice was not well cooked .
payment for the food and experience was terrible .
buffet was not great and dinner was terrible .
i ordered online almost two hours ago .
zero stars if i could .
and why he demanded cash .
i warn you to not support this guy .
people like that do n't last long in business .
i am a single mother with no family around .
there reaction was that nothing they did would fix it !
poorly managed .
money down the drain .
would n't renew even if i was nearby .
they would not agree to anything .
so we paid our last required payments and never went back .
the pool was nice and some of the treadmills were good .
very weird .
clearly the management does n't care if customers have a good experience .
if i ever move back to madison , i wo n't be going here .
glad you guys made a quick buck , it might be your last .
i was really disappointed in the child care area tonight .
it 's horrible .
wan na add a member of your family to your membership ?
i could n't have said it better and agree _num_ % .
silly me for not reading the fine print .
no hello .
no apologies for waiting .
no more .
the club is way overrated .
restrooms are questionable as well as swimming pool , sauna and worst steam room .
very disappointing .
do n't waste your money and time here .
not helpful .
not professional .
dirty pool area and steam room is disgusting .
i 've never seen such a dirty steam room in my entire life .
not worth it .
worst bank ever !
location is good , apartment is bad , management is even worse .
maintenance is very poor .
never on time and that too i had to remind many times .
honestly , it 's some of the worst sesame chicken i 've ever had .
way too much sauce and the chicken was super slimy .
in fact it was mostly slimy breading and hardly any chicken .
the wonton soup i got was better but not by much .
there is nothing positive i could say about this food .
i have never had such low quality chinese food .
everything tasted the same and sauce was greasy and slimy .
today i regret eating this garbage and wasting the calories .
they tend to say oh ok , and not take it seriously .
so , do your own research , like i started doing .
probably one of the most depressing stores i have ever entered .
i was looking for some desk accessories after going to _num_ competitors .
he gave a sarcastic `` have a good night '' as i left .
i will never shop here again and this experience was the last straw .
not a fan of best western but had no choice .
anyways , my room was spacious but felt dirty .
it was either too cold or too stuffy .
hopefully i do n't have to stay at this hotel again .
)
however , the following items were disappointing .
- the bed sheets were n't exactly clean .
- there was a bar of soap lying in the bathtub with more hair .
gross .
they were extremely small pillows like one would find on a couch .
maybe housekeeping can close the door to the room when they are vacuuming ?
annoying !
and we had to wait for the tv to boot up again .
probably wo n't be back .
maybe housekeeping can close the door to the room when they are vacuuming ?
annoying !
holy crap !
you can find better quality .
i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
well , the end of the week came , and no call .
now i was really worried .
i looked at the shoes , and he had done absolutely nothing .
well ... it 's halloween and no call .
not done , could n't even find them .
worst .
shoe repair takes forever .
the place is a mess .
service is poor .
the last pair were garbage .
it 's not worth the headache , go somewhere else if you can .
she said i should be fine with the _num_ days to stretch .
turns out they did not attempt to work on them .
terrible experience .
extremely poor customer service .
he told me he would n't honor it .
i was very dissapointed because i have used them consistently over the past year .
he was very rude when i questioned him .
my bill was over $ _num_ .
he has no customer service skills .
brian was rude , unhelpful and has no customer service skills .
we were very wrong .
wrong again .
one costing $ _num_ and the other costing $ _num_ .
i do not mind when companies try to sell their product .
the problem here lies in the way he spoke to us .
we are not stupid by any means .
fall right off ?
unfortunately the people running this place are extremely unfriendly and unpleasant .
i knew the minute i stepped in , this place was terrible .
there 's just no luck in it .
the place consisted of about _num_ sections of food .
they were super breaded and were questionable in the interior .
the pot stickers were the worst of the bunch .
the chicken wings were also so stale that i could n't stomach them .
crappy vegetarian selection .
dare i say , i 'm almost afraid of it .
i go up and put a small sampling of anything that looks appetizing .
i do n't know the food well enough to take huge chances .
surprisingly , i do n't remember finding white rice .
i saw a few yelper 's mention that the staff was n't very friendly .
only good thing : the beer is reasonably priced .
this place is only good for some fries so why go here .
it is n't .
put it down and slowly step away from the sandwich .
the chicken patty is difficult to describe .
it is not breaded and was in my sandwich pretty warm .
it tastes like a mcdonald 's mc rib patty without the barbecue sauce .
but this is a weird one .
stated hours on tuesday are open till midnight .
big mistake !
clearly my consultant had no desire to work with me .
but whatever it was , she was very unfriendly this time around .
instead , she asked a laundry list of impersonal questions .
mush ! ''
i would not recommend vera 's to any bride or bridal party .
i do n't know if i trust them to do my alterations .
fast forward to today , _num_ weeks before my wedding .
this is a review of my bridal appointment in _num_ .
big mistake !
i went with her _num_ or _num_ times after she found her dress .
holy rude service : - ( my poor friend !
sorry , not the point .
you wo n't find a better one . ''
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
very disappointed !
vera 's house of bridal is very unprofessional .
when we arrived at vera 's they were extremely over booked .
they never even asked if we would like a glass of water .
i was so disappointed when i left that i cried all the way home .
completely a waste of my time and money traveling to vera 's .
lazy groomers !
i took my dog there yesterday and they were terrible .
on the phone they told me the price would be $ _num_ .
when i dropped him off the literally dragged him away right away .
they made no attempt to help him be more comfortable .
something i know is not true because i use it on him at home .
they did n't bother to let me know or explain .
i will not be taking my dog back there .
they 've lost my business .
fish dept ... eh nothing spectacular , quite a few dead ones floating .
not worth the time and trouble .
very poor customer service .
it gets worse , though .
uh , does this look like walgreens ?
what a pathetic excuse for customer service .
this was about _num_ minutes into the beginning of my order .
horrible .
ridiculous .
they do n't care about the customer .
angel cards are their pathetic life over there .
instead the entire staff stood in groups chatting and laughing .
very sad !
we paid $ _num_ for _num_ hours of bowling .
this is an absurd price for bowling .
as to the bowling alley itself , drinks are decently priced for madison .
the selection of bowling balls is bad .
if you want to get ripped off on a date , come here .
otherwise , avoid !
look carefully at how cheap management is .
sadly customer is not a concern .
the worst !
could not believe how poor the service is at this place .
one bad apple or even two , but the entire place ?
they are awful .
never again , i am certain of that !
the atmosphere and service was stuffy and rather cold .
our baked potatoes and salads were simple , plain and dull .
the experience is not worth the price .
not the best dining experience .
would definitely select ruth chris or flemings instead .
the steak was bland and pan seared ?
the potato lacked the garlic they we 're suppose to have .
not a good restaurant .
just left this place with my wife .
poor service .
seafood and fish unappealing .
we had the seafood satay starter , salad and fish and chips .
server team was pleasant but very slow .
when her salad was served it had the wrong salad dressing that she ordered .
my garlic potatoes were short changed on the garlic .
we felt we were being rushed so they could clear the table .
but the prices are as expensive as any other steakhouse .
we were seated and served waters right away .
the side salads were fine , pretty typical .
however , both steaks were served with a side of disappointment .
husband ordered his strip medium and his was way more pink than mine .
both steaks seemed to be severely lacking in the salt department .
the garlic mashed potatoes were good ; it 's hard to mess those up .
so far , my worst steak in madison .
i tipped him a flat _num_ % .
there was another server ( manager ? )
the food was not .
it ruined the salad for us .
i just would n't go back .
unfortunately , the steaks were not good .
the ribeye was very tough and lacked seasoning .
he said it was one of the worst he 's at a steakhouse .
the flavor was missing as well .
we were very disappointed .
if only zero stars was an option .
and , they are quick to tell you they are not ups .
i will not be bringing any business to this store in the future .
yeah , but a $ _num_ roll of tape ?
it was a little bit awkward , just us and the sushi chefs .
our waiter was either very fast or very slow with service .
we never saw the other appetizer ... like we never even ordered it .
we were not charged for it , but i still was n't thrilled .
sushi quality was very mediocre .
i did n't get ill afterwards , so that 's good .
it only gets two stars because i did n't get sick from the fish .
i will not come here again though .
the place would do so much better with a little remodeling !
the fish i had was very fishy and the sides were over salted .
for the price i would pass until i see progress .
i 'm so sad to have to write this review .
to begin with , it was freezing in there .
i never did take off my down ski jacket .
next , the menus : gross !
the food is yummy though !
too much , but i guess you ca n't complain about that .
an hour and _num_ minutes after we arrived , we were set to go .
this was the worst sushi place i have ever eaten at .
the decor is very tired and not that clean .
sushi was not fresh , tempura was cold , and miso soup was salty .
sorry for the rant , but it was that bad !
the service is completely incompetent .
this is the only restaurant i would never give a second chance to .
that bad .
however , i would not recommend .
we had a reservation tonight for _num_ at 6:00 .
once we got the food it was just bland .
absolutely no taste in the beef teriyaki that i had .
to top it off the cook was expecting tips for his performance .
it was embarrassing to say the least and a real disappointment .
there are so much better japanese in madison that we wont go again .
my memories of the hibachi here were very fond .
walking into the restaurant , the place looked relatively slow .
this was a tuesday night with about _num_ people total in the restaurant .
the hostess was less than courteous to say the least .
the hibachi performance was not inspiring and the food was bland .
this was truly the worst dining experience i have ever had .
upon entering , the restaurant stunk , like dirty wet dog .
i could literally feel dirt , dropped food etc on the floor .
the paint and wallpaper were peeling off .
everyone seemed to be confused and rushed .
the sushi was not fresh .
some of it i could n't even eat .
while i appreciated the effort to make it better , we will never return .
soup was hot .
sashimi plate was just ok .
selection is very limited and not as fresh as some other places .
tea was $ _num_ and lukewarm so probably want to pass on that .
i was hungry , had n't had lunch , and wanted to treat myself .
i handed the first chef my menu .
instead , i get two platters of all of the sushi i ordered .
i said nothing - my waiter continued coming back to check on me .
well , this is the opposite .
food is ok , service sucked .
_num_ star for the chefs .
just ate here for the last time .
have gone here probably _num_ times total in the past _num_ years .
however quality control is non existent .
totally disappointed .
check out vip sushi next door .
much better and where i 'll be taking my business from now on .
this place is tired .
that 's not ok .
could probably accommodate _num_ comfortably ; _num_ maybe .
we had _num_ rolls and they were fine , but nothing special .
totally disgusting .
the area behind the bar was filled with trash .
i wo n't be back .
complained and was told `` well walk ins wait _num_ hours . ''
staff was rude .
my most frequented of their establishments was their west side location .
the hostess never seated us and barely even acknowledged us .
she said she would refund everything including the soup and soda .
just ate here ... could be better .
when we got the food , it was less than to be desired .
total disappointment .
onion volcano , dumb .
even their eel , my favorite , is crappy now .
the service was also very slow .
waited an hour for awful sushi .
even grocery store sushi .
sushi i do n't even want to finish .
not fresh , not flavorful , even the wasabi was bland .
i could almost feel myself getting food poisoning .
horrible service , we ended up having to go look for our check .
mediocre food .
edamame was cold and not even salted .
age tofu was soggy .
sushi was nothing to come back for .
this place is a mess .
thick layer of grease on every table surface .
the place was completely and utterly understaffed .
i literally can not imagine ever getting hibachi anywhere again after this experience .
i am so disappointed !
people , this was _num_ % cabbage - almost all filler .
oh , and the `` maki roll '' is a stale spring roll .
not good at all .
i ca n't imagine enjoying it much otherwise .
she was just obnoxious and full of herself .
not my idea of fun .
otherwise i 'm holding out for the new laser tag place that just opened .
customer service was not good at all .
the workers here were very rude to us .
the second game , the worker just stood by the exit the whole time .
as others stated , this is a teams only .
if your group is very big , you will be split up .
the meat was dry .
to top it off , our waitress was really ... unusual .
then she told us how she ate a _num_ pound burrito on a bet .
but , obviously , i am wrong .
gross .
gross gross gross .
the food has been sub-par my last couple of visits as well .
Negative
pedro , if i could give you negative stars i would .
steven l from ma , said it all .
this place is disgusting !
a black bean and cheese burrito with no cheese ?
pedro , you owe me $ _num_ back .
are you kidding me ?
just avoid this place at all costs .
horchata was horrible , they are better off buying the pre-made stuff .
bland food and flavorless sauces abound .
everything was just bland and limp .
tl ; dr : bleh .
big big big mistake .
the food was awful .
the chips were very salty and the salsa is bland and uninspired .
the enchiladas ( chicken ) had little chicken .
avoid at all costs .
not a fan ... you can get significantly better mexican food elsewhere .
i 'm not exactly sure how to describe it .
it does n't taste right , let alone taste okay .
i would n't recommend stopping by here .
there are so many other better options .
- approximately zero communication .
not dripping , but way too wet to sit on .
_num_ hours later , my seats are still wet .
my favorite was the phone book left on the wet seat .
worst car wash ever .
it 's waste of money i am not going back to this place .
for _num_ , the machine washed the outside off car .
interior was n't touched .
positive my _num_ year old will do a better job for less .
i then realized how good of a wash i should have been getting .
since then i have n't gone back .
otherwise i would n't recommend it .
they just do n't clean the interior as well as octopus .
worst car wash i ever got .
horrible experiences , and i 'll never go back .
the past three times have been quite horrible .
do not go here , you will be extremely disappointed .
horrible .
waist of money .
sad because this place used to be so much better .
it 's gets worse every year .
not anymore .
i explained it all over to him and they let me back through .
this time , i just wrote it off and left .
not worth my time .
i dont even understand why they do it at all .
this carwash is not much better than a drive-through gas station type car wash .
ive just set my expectations very low .
total rip off !
worst cleaning service on the planet and the most expensive .
never never never use these people .
merry maids are the worse !
their employees do n't speak english so communication is impossible .
do not use this company !
when quoted , my attitude was `` you get what you pay for . ''
place was not clean .
walls were not cleaned at all , floors were not very well cleaned .
on the plus side carpet was fairly clean as were the appliances .
i 'd have to say total rip-off at the prices they charge .
they started off doing a great job cleaning my house .
no one returned my call .
ok but why did n't you say so at first place ?
ca n't believe such a company should have such lousy warehouse management .
went to exchange some coffee mugs and the lady was so confused .
they could not read there own receipt .
bath towel , hand towel , facial ... .
i looked high and low , nope .
she was less helpful .
this store really needs a serious overhaul .
first time here and we received terrible customer service .
if not , be prepared .
they apparently hate working here .
there is no such thing ! ''
my mistake , i mean _num_ year cheddar .
i had accidentally used the price in place of the year .
never a thank you , never a friendly chit chat at check out .
i really hate this place but the cheese and sausage are good .
did n't mean to add insult to injury .
if i return i wo n't worry about what i buy from the shelf .
positives were selection , they got everything , and being located near target .
second visit no staff to help me .
too cramped and spotty service .
the food was ok , not worth the wait .
would not recommend this place .
an hour and fifteen minutes pass , no pizza .
was immediately placed on hold and left there for _num_ minutes .
was immediately placed on hold and left there for _num_ minutes .
the only positive thing about glass nickel is that they 're open late .
the quality is horrible compared to what they charge .
sorry but this is overpriced and does n't taste very well .
tonight was the worst yet .
_num_ minutes later i have no food .
get my order to me asap !
oh , so you have n't even left the restaurant yet .
however , not once was i offered anything for the trouble .
online ordering is atrocious .
it is one of the most atrocious user experience i have ever encountered .
how does your online experience suck this bad ?
food is always lukewarm and all seems to taste the same .
we have been disappointed the last several times .
you get all the way thru your order to have your card declined .
call it in with no problem .
first time order , it was delivery and was wrong .
ordered italian sub and turkey club was sent .
disappointing when that 's the only thing you ordered .
however , the online ordering system has not been working correctly .
rather than taking care of us , the employees are super rude about it .
my haircut lasted a total of _num_ minutes .
the stylist did n't wet my hair before she cut it .
she did n't try to style it after she finished cutting it .
very disappointed .
half of the condiments and veggie bins are empty .
the options to put on sandwiches are super limited .
_num_ dollars for an _num_ inch ham and cheese that tastes like crap ?
mediocre food and terrible service from this location .
tonight , still no sauce .
a couple weeks ago , my brother convinced me to order from cj .
i tried the sesame chicken , and it was delicious .
tonight , christmas eve , i decided to give them another go .
i ordered the sesame chicken again , and an order of lemon chicken .
i recently went vegan and ordered the bean curd szechuan style .
ordered _num_ items for my husband and myself over the phone .
the food was ok i guess .
it was hard and crusty .
overall not a nice place .
the food is so bad .
he rushed me and was very rude .
wished we checked our food before we left because we ended up sharing rice .
we 'll have to find another chinese place when we visit again !
it 's mediocre at best .
really ?
will never be used and we wo n't be shopping with you any longer .
not impressed .
he told me there is no food allowed .
this is a play land , not a picnic land '' .
wow ... tim at the store is the most rude nasty person .
they are awful to work with .
pretty lame excuse i think .
it took a client of mine _num_ hours to make a simple policy change .
ca n't wait to get out of here .
i had a bill that i was making payments on .
next thing i know its sent to collections .
i am pleased with the care my husband is receiving tonight in er .
had the most horrible experience with them .
only gave it one star because zero was n't an option .
actually one of the worst lattes i have ever had .
just awful .
zero foam and not hot enough .
typical diner that serves bad food at okay prices .
severe lack of vegetarian options .
overall , pretty lackluster restaurant .
the menu was n't impressive .
the coffee was awful .
service was prompt but lacking any warmth .
the food was unremarkable but not bad .
not good .
i ordered the broasted chicken , blah !
not a good meal , disappointed after reading good reviews .
cabbage roll was way too salty .
rack of ribs too fatty .
for everyone else , there is so much left to be desired .
today was _num_ all you can eat bbq ribs or pasta .
i have no idea how that goes with salmon .
a couple of steamed veggies would have paired nicely .
salmon was okay , nothing special that you could n't whip up at home .
they do n't even have a plain marinara sauce option for spaghetti !
the service was terrible .
the management was terrible that night .
horrible .
glass bottled ketchup is so difficult to use .
probably would try a different place the next time we visit .
it appeared to be reasonably clean , but it is very dated looking .
the choices were broccoli cheese or clam chowder .
the clam chowder was nearly inedible .
the burgers were average at best , and that 's about what was expected .
the fries were just barely warm all around .
sorry , but we wo n't be coming back .
at that price point , there are too many other better options out there .
went in looking for fabrics and info for my daughter to do sewing lessons .
i will never be back .
if you want absolute rudeness and no customer service ... go here .
the minute i do , my strawberry fields days will be over .
the cashier was half asleep and way hung over .
strawberry fields of the old days it is not .
not so much .
i told him i was about _num_ min away .
obviously , they do n't care about customers .
um , wtf ?
it was n't that horrible .
this ruined our awesome experience .
and it sucked .
thanks for treating us like crap , jerk .
do not waste your money !
i 'd passed it several times and was just looking for an occasion .
anyway , he got the breakfast burrito and i got the breakfast sandwich .
i did n't even know i liked salsa on eggs .
the bacon was tasty , the hashbrowns mushy .
not worth $ _num_ .
he gave me half of his burrito in exchange for half of mine .
it has never been so bad .
the only reason why we placed _num_ stars is because of the food .
it was so bad .
ok , the food 's better than edible .
the food is consistently mediocre .
does it have some meaning i do n't know ?
just do n't stay for a meal .
this place is hit and miss .
i did n't even bother leaving a tip nor will i ever return again .
also , the waitress i had the other day was really rude .
in case you do n't get out much , the courier cafe is terrible .
they are operating as if they have no competition .
this is an update to my full review below .
so with much pressure , i gave in .
even today i still am not quite sure .
let me say that neither was really that good , especially the pesto pita .
the shake is what is bringing my review from _num_ star to _num_ .
the bathrooms are appalling .
did i come on a bad night ?
this place was seriously bad !
i went there with a bunch of friends and it was just underwhelming .
given the lack of customers , service was pretty slow .
the fries are not fries , they 're potato wedges .
courier cafe is overrated .
a few weeks ago , i went to courier cafe and ordered fish .
it was flavorless .
it was served with thin slices of lemon on top of it .
also on the plate were three slices of cucumber and a slice of tomato .
not sure why .
as for the food , it was average ... nothing great .
unfortunately , today i was very disappointed .
after being seated , we were ignored for nearly fifteen minutes .
it was very frustrating .
the busboy placed waters on our table and left us waiting .
worst meal i have ever eaten out !
tasted worse .
i should have sent my dinner back and just had another bowl of soup .
the past few months , it 's been the complete opposite .
food is horrible , and the service is even worse .
our visit tonight was a pretty lousy one .
the courier burger was alright , but not really anything phenomenal .
the time spent waiting for our food was pretty unreasonable .
the fried chicken apparently was the item that held up our table .
the waitress said they must have mixed them up in the back .
waitresses do n't even pretend like they want to be there .
worst dinning experience ever .
slow service , horrible management , food was alright at best .
would n't serve us alcohol which i get .
waited _num_ minutes for our food and it was n't even busy .
my date could not even finished one , and she 's usually not picky .
they also smothered the tacos with some creamy sauce .
the ambiance of the place is that straight from a vintage movie .
the service was n't too bad .
first time by myself was positive , good value breakfast , nothing went wrong .
there probably wo n't be a third though .
i do n't know where to start with this local `` favorite '' .
the coffee was weak .
the omelet was cold , the hash browns were undercooked and cold .
not worth the wait .
sounds disgusting do n't it ?
how you can mistake mayo for sour cream , i do not know .
needless to say the baked potato never got ate .
ordered salmon with vegetables .
first trip here was much better .
second one wo n't have me coming back .
but the food was not good .
it was all kinds of creepy and unhelpful .
i think unless your 're a good looking girl wo n't even help you .
the worst service ever .
not helpful at all .
`` sorry , we 're out of chicken . ''
`` sorry , we 're out of ice cream , too . ''
this is not the place to go for your lunch hour .
they are incredibly slow and they really do n't care that they are .
yeah , more like _num_ minutes !
with only an hour for lunch that is unacceptable .
not downright bad , definitely not particularly good .
all for just under $ _num_ .
my omelet was pretty nasty and i ended up just eating half of it .
to begin with , i wish yelp !
my waitress was efficient and personable .
the coffee was n't very good .
the muffin french toast was awful .
the service , however , leaves much to be desired .
and the waitress did n't say a thing the whole time .
_num_ .
the service staff showed little effort .
_num_ .
there were very few customers so i was hoping we would have good service .
unfortunately we have had this type of service in the past .
i do n't care if you have the best food on the planet .
if your service is lousy , then it ruins the whole experience .
food is not great , but also expensive .
years ago this was n't such a bad place to eat .
it has since , gone down the drain !
it took way too long for our order to arrive , about _num_ minutes .
tasted of cheap store brand mac .
i got eggs and hashbrowns which were bland and overpriced .
my whole family was disappointed with the food .
i just asked about the muffins deal and she was so upset and rude .
bad service , super slow .
do n't come here if you really wan na just get something to eat .
_num_ mins waiting , ca n't believe it .
the server just drop the plates in my table , so rude !
she clearly stated that she wanted baja benedict without bacon .
by far the worst mother 's day brunch we 've ever had .
would not recommend this place to anyone .
first of all -- these sandwiches taste like nothing .
i 'm slightly confused at the high ratings .
better than the worst ?
that was disappointing .
i went on a monday night , the week after valentines day .
the lasagna was ok ... really nothing special at all .
the dessert , however was delicious .
warm chocolate brioche bread pudding topped with vanilla ice cream ?
i was extremely disappointed with sunday brunch today .
everything else was cold , crusty crap .
i was really expecting much better things from this restaurant .
well , not so much .
it came with a cream sauce , asparagus , mushrooms , and carrots .
sadly , i did n't order a salad because those actually looked pretty good .
the bread was boring , my _num_ filet had no flavor .
my server did not want to be there .
the food here is just plain terrible .
Negative
if i could i would give them negative stars .
not very professional .
as a business , needs improvement .
disappointing .
for the money they charge the food should be better .
scallop entree was lukewarm , terrible .
definitely a stressful and extremely unpleasant dream .
we had a 9pm reservation with a $ _num_ required deposit .
it was very uncomfortable .
it is completely unnecessary , their restaurant would be packed skipped reservations or not .
i 've been here probably _num_ times over the course of many years .
it is all less than mediocre .
they have scrambled eggs in the buffet line but ... gross .
side note , try not to get seated by the omelet station .
this place is such a mess .
food and service are below average and they are not even that busy .
man where is an outback restaurant in urbana ?
it 's always disappointing .
after reading some of the reviews i can see it 's not just me .
not worth it .
after another five minutes had passed i was becoming rather annoyed .
now this is $ _num_ so we had great expectations .
the shrimp for the shrimp cocktail was so over-cooked as to be mushy .
and it 's not good .
the bacon and sausage were n't particularly flavorful .
of all the places we ate in champaign , this was the worst .
the wait was not _num_ minutes , but more like an hour .
been here several times over the years and have never been impressed .
it was a very expensive meal for something i could not eat .
just had a pretty disappointing lunch experience here today .
courier cafe had a _num_ minute wait so we decided to hop over here .
we switched plates , no big deal .
the steak itself was dry , chewy , and flavorless .
the service was nothing of note either way .
i wont be returning and would not recommend .
the lobster was extremely overcooked , like chewing on tire .
bad service , terrible ( and expensive ) food , awful ambiance .
and a fly died in my husband 's beer .
seemed to me with no organization at all .
they were 30-40 mins late getting stuff refilled and turned over .
we were seated in the bar area by the kitchen , loud .
i 've been staying in this place for quiet awhile for work .
ruined some food freezing 1/2 the times .
3/4 of the time the fridge do n't work when entering the room .
stayed at this hotel 30+ nights .
for not replacing the food they should of been responsible for replacing .
i stayed here _num_ days ago .
if they wo n't return calls something is wrong .
call down stairs and she says we will have to move down stairs .
finally get in tub 1:30 their time and 2:30 my time .
the silver cover to the drain starts floating around the tub .
nonetheless , the first experience leaves a bitter taste in my mouth .
the jeans were brand new , never worn .
when i picked up the jeans they were awful .
it was supposed to be at the most $ _num_ .
three weeks later the jeans had not even been sent to the tailor .
it was disorganized , chaotic , and expensive .
concord has lost my business for good .
very poor customer service .
these people are terrible !
i would leave a _num_ if i could .
lots of food and grease .
solid cheap drunk food .
my experience was trash compared to the rest of the yelpers here .
they had _num_ burgers and fries for $ _num_ on special .
i also ordered _num_ single gyro .
it came out to $ _num_ .
what i actually got was _num_ burgers , a single gyro but no fries .
no receipt was given so who knows if it was right at all ?
i know gyros are a greasy food , but this was excessive .
_num_ star for portions , if that ... .
i ordered online _num_ minutes before close .
if this was all that happened , i would be okay with it .
i just spent _num_ minutes of my life in the drive through !
but that 's not what bothers me .
i ordered the italian beef sandwich , which was priced at $ _num_ .
no fries or drink .
and the baklava was not good .
no internet , still .
hard beds ... .
stayed _num_ nights .
no , i repeat , no housekeeping was done the first day .
requested _num_ towels , person brought up _num_ .
unfortunate because i am a big fan of the holiday inn brand .
staff that is not lazy .
but the point being was a large open space with people gathering .
i had the unfortunate luck of getting an interior room .
the hotel was definitely not clean by our standards .
the noise in the hotel was like nothing i had ever experienced .
the other guests in the hotel were also outrageously loud .
a cleaning person in the hall did n't even try to stop them .
air con ran but did not cool the room .
ugh .
shower water pressure was low .
bed hard as a rock .
bare basics , no tissue .
this was the doctor 's office i used all throughout college .
well , just barely .
but then you go into another waiting room .
my worst ever experience here was when i had an eye infection .
my eyes were so red , they hurt in bright lights and watered constantly .
my biggest complaint was the room temperature .
i was so cold at night !
the bad news is that this is on par with the old motel _num_ .
we are talking old rooms , very thin walls and an awful continental breakfast .
i think i 'd rather eat junk from a vending machine next time .
i 've never before had a blt that used diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce .
we also had the chili , served in a bread bowl .
this place is pretty inconsistent .
the breakfast burrito and breakfast pizza are both pretty cheap and reasonably filling .
( i have n't had it myself . )
the lunch dishes are not as good ; the options change each day .
the ones that are bad are pretty bad .
not bad if you have a craving , but there are better options elsewhere .
the salsa and hummus plate 's not bad for a snack .
the hamburgers are gross .
there is not much mango to be found either .
they charge for refills on soft drinks , too .
ca n't comment on the baked goods , have n't had them .
just , do n't go here except maybe for the nachos .
the chef does not care .
this unit should be sold to comfort inn , maybe even red roof inn !
not up to hilton standards at all .
the fitness room and pool are dirty , small and a tad gross too .
first off , maintenance for the complex was terrible .
as a result , i have fallen a couple of times .
bugs are also a big problem .
con : their properties are mostly old ( before 70s ) .
so everything is old and not work perfectly .
talked to a female staff member on the phone .
the employees here are incredibly rude .
the baked good i ordered had to have been a week old .
he simply said sorry and watched me throw mine away .
while espresso royale has a good environment the actual drinks are absolute crap .
if you need to get stuff done , look elsewhere .
rude to mean staff depending on your definition of customer service .
ordered hot chocolate and latte was nine bucks for alright drinks .
cinnamon buns are _num_ bucks here .
`` no , i 'm super busy , '' he replied .
so , be warned .
do n't know if i 'd ever go meat here again !
the buffalo one was ... not very good , and skimpy on toppings .
the bad things : the waitress is extremely rude .
they have a bad beer selection too .
you obviously do n't understand the idea of cool .
am i the only one who thought the bartenders were rude bitches ?
glad to see that i 'm not .
however , there are no bargains to be had hear .
methinks not . ''
ok , first warning .
i 'm sorry . ''
ummm ... ok , second warning .
`` ... all the while , i am losing length .
the final cut was nothing like what i asked for .
btw i do n't wear bangs .
just because a hairstylist is experienced does n't mean they are current .
they could be giving clients the same bad cut for years .
never went there again .
only to find out that they are running 20+ mins behind schedule .
i wanted to be , and deserve to be pampered .
i could n't reschedule because family is coming to my house for the holidays .
this was my only time to get my hair done .
very disappointing .
i really wanted to like this place , but had a bad experience .
the office is permanently closed .
the atmosphere : the downstairs bar area is small and cheap looking .
the quality of service is not in line with the menu .
wrong silverware , no bread plates .
bread service was slow though the bread was good .
however , when the salad arrived , there was no bacon .
`` excuse me , but our salads have no bacon . ''
the thin crust must be one of the best i 've ever had .
the duck breast was well prepared .
the trout was overcooked but was still edible .
it 's hard to enjoy any restaurant when you are unhappy with the service .
but there 's no way i would pay full price here .
its not a bad restaurant but its not great either .
overall the dining experience was mixed .
what a lame excuse !
even charges $ _num_ for complimentary bread that you find in most restaurants .
many of us ordered the fettuccine with salmon pasta , which was horrible .
the portion sizes are very small .
little diamond in the rough .
_num_ minutes with a fifteen or better walk up to green ?
i mean , it 's not like you could order and they 'd deliver .
but you could pick-up , so that was something .
when the new place was built across the street , we were all glad .
just limit your expectations .
sadly , we were a little underwhelmed .
needless to say , we were excited to give it a try .
when you walk in , you must go upstairs to be seated .
it was our locally inspired entrees that were especially disappointing .
after a long decision making process , i went with the $ _num_ halibut .
it came with gnocchi and assorted vegetables .
all i know is , it would hit me every now and again .
i do not like garcia 's pizza very much !
the pizza is nothing to talk about and i would suggest going somewhere else !
after reading the reviews on here , i expected this place to be amazing .
this is an awful mall .
for the four years i went here i might have come here twice !
they had pretty much no stores here because everything was shut down !
the rate for oil change is pretty reasonable : $ _num_ including tax .
the car is _num_ years old , so it is reasonable to change battery .
this is ridiculous !
they were fast and to the point , the way i like it .
they told me that my car would be finished before they close at noon .
the wait was n't what bothered me .
of course , the air pressure would be different .
`` whoever put the muffler on had no idea what they were doing . ''
i would n't go back .
no tire rotation was performed period .
it was an extremely disappointing experience .
i did n't know that pork could be soggy .
and what few fries were n't soggy from sauce were soggy from the pickle .
my staff was slightly hard to understand , but took my order .
there 's no table service , but i did n't expect that .
i was very disappointed .
literally it was a fried fish patty in a bun .
my ribs were less than pleasing .
fries come with every meal , you know like ten fries .
hole-in-the-wall or not ... do n't need to come back to this place .
decor is lacking greatly and the overall environment was quite dirty and messy .
i 've gone when things were already prepared and things were n't very good .
you 'll need water to wash down this sweet concoction .
the bread was soggy from the watery sauce and on a hoagie !
the barbeque this place serves reminds me of very average cafeteria style food .
unfortunately , everything else that makes the sandwich fails .
the bread is not much better .
sides were also generally unimpressive .
it tasted like eating raw potatoes .
the place was really busy on a sunday .
i ate lunch there today and ordered a 1/2 slab , slaw and beans .
i actually could n't get them apart to eat them .
dry and bland !
every time i go to this one in urbana , the service gets worse .
chicken was very dry and ribs were chewy .
slaw was watered down and fries tasted old .
horrible !
dry , flavorless chicken .
soggy corn - as though it was sitting in water all day .
the current quality is really a disappointment .
my last three pork sandwiches were soggy and gross .
i was disappointed .
ordered slab of ribs and ribs were over cooked .
thought it would be pulled pork but was not .
that would not have been so bad though but meat was cold .
no decor to speak of and not friendly people to deal with .
would not go to again .
i 'm not going here again .
so unhappy and still hungry !
this journey begins the same way it ended , poorly .
unfortunately what was not cool were how bland the steak fries were .
the rib tips were very thin and barely had meat on them .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i would have preferred sleeping outside or in the car .
we switched twice with the same disgusting problems .
this was one of the biggest mistakes i have ever made .
he then gave me the key card to the right room .
this was the beginning of the bad experience .
it was a disaster .
_num_ ) no clock , no radio nothing much in the room .
not even a bible .
i got what i paid for , so i ca n't complain !
there are not blood stains on the sheets or anything ridiculous like that .
my wife did not enjoy the hotel .
tables are constantly dirty .
just drive the extra _num_ minutes and go to another location .
honestly , worst taco bell ever .
sometime _num_ min + in the drive thru with _num_ cars .
but this place was worse than average .
very very slow drive through .
waited way too long at the speaker .
once you enter this drive through there is no way out .
stay away from this taco bell !
rude , dirty , and low quality even for a taco bell .
horrible horrible horrible horrible , nearly _num_ minutes stuck in the drive-through .
no apology when i got to the window .
they just do n't care .
possibly the worst drive through in the country .
they ripped us off .
( mind you , these shoes originally cost $ _num_ .
totally not the store 's fault .
in the time we were there , i counted _num_ employees .
omg possibly the worst experience of my life .
extremely small , crowded club with barely five feet of floor area in front .
had a horrible experience at this club .
security came up , we pointed her out to the security guard .
unfortunately this place is good for music and nothing else .
this place is literally so poorly managed it 's ridiculous .
this is what earns the lowest rating for this review .
my sister used this shop because she does n't have a clue .
she says her chain comes off all the time .
$ _num_ for a tube ?
terrible service , terrible prices .
i agree with the others -- terrible service and terrible prices .
the guys that work the counter are extremely rude , short , and arrogant .
my handle bars are still crooked , and front fork off balance .
i 've purchased at least _num_ bikes over the last _num_ years there .
i missed the one year mark by _num_ days .
they said too bad and wanted to charge me $ _num_ .
Neutral
the atmosphere in the store always has a negative vibe .
no one is talking to each other , no enthusiasm .
long story short , these people are jerks .
i just got ripped off by this disgusting store .
i had a flat tire and decided to go here .
still , i chose to purchase it .
my complaint however is that this library is always noisy .
a beautiful library that is unfortunately loud .
just do n't try calling the front desk .
_num_ .
_num_ .
bad experience and service .
i emailed the hotel _num_ times and got no response at all .
this hotel is not one of them .
now i know not to trust my experiences , read the reviews first .
this hotel is not one of them .
now i know not to trust my experiences , read the reviews first .
i do n't know about the rooms but the staff definitely was extremely rude .
do n't make the mistake i did and stay here .
the room , hall and linens were dirty and smelled bad .
avoid this place .
first off , we booked this hotel over a month ago .
they asked for my information and knew i was _num_ years old .
we drove _num_ hours to u of i and get there around _num_ .
absolutely horrible customer service .
our room was pretty warm and could n't get the a/c to work .
however there was another employee that was very friendly .
the disappointing part was the only fruit they had was apples .
the worst people to deal with .
it 's not worth the savings .
they are completely incompetent .
rude staff .
sleep in your cars .
alas , they never showed up for the appointment .
dive right in !
the staff ... sucks !
so rude !
an ok , but not great , place to grab a sandwich for lunch .
not surprisingly , they do have really good bread .
horrible destination for dinner .
i 've been in twice for dinner and was very disappointed both times .
sometimes they include potatoes and salad with the sandwich , sometimes they do n't .
do n't bother coming here .
the crust of our italian bread was burnt .
our waitress said they were _num_ inch pizzas .
our waitress was not .
oh and their sangria is on point , too .
but really , what college kid is drinking sangria ?
i 'm not mean .
i 'm not demanding .
i just want a glass of wine and some food .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
do not pretend that you are a really good waitress who can remember everything .
_num_ .
_num_ .
do not let our wine glasses get empty .
we hate it here too .
terrible service .
and today i decided to finally put my disappointment on the internet .
it was too watery , but maybe that is my taste .
but this seems to be the way things go at the bread company .
overall the bread company is uninspired and very tired .
however , the service was very poor .
it was , by far , the worst restaurant service i have ever experienced .
the waitress i had was unfriendly .
however , if you have any standards for customer service , do n't bother .
ick .
lemonade fair at $ _num_ a glass .
fairly small thin pizza $ _num_ .
price was over $ _num_ .
so , i tell her , we need the diet coke .
never offered me a refund or to make it correct .
i got a turkey sandwich .
and then , i got sick ... ... i will never return .
awful , awful , awful .
their prices keep going up , the service down below .
not a glass of water even .
a _num_ minutes wait without as much as an apology .
everything way too salty .
barely edible .
unfortunately this was not the case .
do not recommend .
the low star rating is a warning sign for people considering moving here .
i wish to inform you of the problems you will face .
_num_ weeks .
i have accompanied my father on several doctor appointments .
i do not trust this facility from my own experience .
_num_ .
the doctor i need wo n't accept new patients .
yet there are no other specialists .
_num_ .
_num_ .
spent _num_ minutes on hold waiting to be transferred to make an appointment .
hung up out of frustration .
not my favorite local chinese restaurant .
the menu is just a little boring .
the service was also quite slow .
service was slow and inattentive .
prices a little on the high side but not horrible .
i have been here once to eat in and it was a nightmare .
ugh .
the food is mediocre at best and very greasy .
the prices , however , ca n't be beat .
( i admit , that 's a low standard . )
but the food is never as good .
without my friend to help us , this is a mediocre place .
this is not good .
sat and waited there for one whole hour and no dish was served .
good for me , bad for someone else .
the other employee apologized and told me to come back another time .
i am not a fan .
crazy that i would bother them by actually ordering food , right ?
let me start by saying i really hate this place .
coffee is bland .
the hipster baristas are rude .
no where to chain up your bike .
they close way too early .
lol .
there must be some mistake .
my complaints with the service , too , are all my fault .
why must i insist on employees who acknowledge my existence ?
clearly , i do n't deserve to go here anymore .
i wo n't .
truly awful coffee .
only then is the coffee even remotely close to its potential .
the sandwiches are good , but inconsistent .
sometimes they will pack the sandwich full of veggies , often not .
$ _num_ gets you a mediocre cup of coffee and that is not right .
but for goodness sake do not go there for the coffee .
i have not been there in a long time because of this reason .
low stars are only there for getting the coffee so wrong for so long .
maybe it was an inexperienced barista , but my iced americano was terrible .
i should 've gone to espresso royale a block down .
the sandwiches are priced at about $ _num_ and they are nothing spectacular .
i 've eaten carrots that were less crunchy .
$ _num_ for a small cup of coffee ?
however , their drinks are not that great and very overpriced .
not a big deal , we just asked for the right size .
tonight was the last time .
_num_ hours before closing and everything in the pastry case was packed up .
theyre too loose .
overall unpleasant experience .
it was very sour and bitter .
no skill at all : / .
the wifi is awful .
slow service - servers do not communicate with you .
based on those , i would give it 4/5 .
however , based on my experience , the food availability appears to be unreliable .
no no no !
this is not how a great bakery should be !
or not interested .
_num_ ) the pastries are really not worth the price .
and the cost of other items does n't meet the quality .
total on the pastry and not large coffee : $ _num_ .
stores do n't have to play the minimum purchase amount game , though .
the pastries are fine but nothing special .
customer service leaves much to be desired .
i 'll be getting my pastries elsewhere .
pastries are ok but not the best i 've had in other places .
the horrible customer service just makes everything taste even worse .
not recommend this place unless you desperately need a piece of cake .
there 's a drop in quality and it breaks my heart .
sadly , you 'd be better off at starbucks or panera .
lovely on the outside , disappointing on the inside .
very rarely do i regret purchasing a croissant ... but this time i do .
nothing about this was light , flaky or buttery .
i did n't even finish it .
i wo n't be back .
is customer service dead ?
i wo n't go back to places that treat customers like a problem .
it was not spicy at all .
my girlfriend got a chicken dish , which was n't any better .
there was a lot , but it was all bland rice .
third , they do n't show exact prices for how their combo plates work .
i paid $ _num_ for fried rice and two menu items .
i ordered the fried rice with sweet & sour chicken .
now i remember why i have n't returned in _num_ years .
their sauce is atrocious .
the service was fast ( 6:30pm ) and friendly .
the chicken fried rice was not good at all .
the box of the last order i placed reeked of smoke .
will i ever order from the urbana papa johns again ?
did n't let me know they were closed .
they did n't let me cancel .
i tried their shrimp pasta ... it was bland and had a weird taste .
the service was a little slow , but friendly .
unfortunately everything else is bad .
come for pool and drinks , leave when you get hungry .
the last time i went was about _num_ months ago .
i do n't know what happened , but the food was terrible !
i had butternut squash ravioli in a cream sauce and it was just awful .
gross .
so not worth it .
do n't order the fish here , it 's clearly frozen , not fresh .
it is just a confused menu .
we ordered the turkey pita sandwich and the chicken parm .
do n't mistake that to mean that the sandwich was in the pocket .
the chicken parm was mediocre at best , more likely just plain bad .
i will say , the staff was courteous and friendly .
this could be the most overrated place in cu .
beer selection good , everything else pretty bad .
we ordered desert before our appetizers because we particularly wanted one of the options .
the service is the reason for my low score .
i went and ordered a beer that the menu stated was _num_ ounces .
the glass it was brought in was clearly not _num_ ounces .
when i brought it to the waitresses attention , she argued the point .
it 's never been great ... but my experience last night was not awesome .
my party was n't ready to order when we first arrived .
he did n't return to our table for over _num_ minutes .
in other words ... a long ass time .
if you 're gon na be slow , at least be gracious .
this place is horrible .
the waiters are rude and the food is average .
nothing worth going back for ... except for the beer which was fantastic .
i had the steak sandwich and was very underwhelmed .
do n't think i 'll be back for the food though .
skip this place at all costs .
i went with a small group and the service was horrible .
i was not even done and told the manager to leave my plate .
the portion size for the beef was laughable at $ _num_ .
the garlic mashed potatoes were decently good .
nothing about it was special and this cost $ _num_ .
a so-so choice for food and drinks in urbana .
that being said , way over priced .
they also stopped having onion rings , which made me sad .
however the food - oh the food : ( - i was disappointed .
the only thing apt about the name was `` bites '' !
nothing special about it .
but the experience was not worth $ _num_ !
will not go back anytime soon !
i was a little disappointed with the brioche bun as it was slightly crispy .
health code rating : b .
the fucking chicken wings are breaded .
i probably would n't go there ever again either .
apparently after the long string of emails she still could n't get it right .
my sister tried on just a few dresses before deciding on one .
so , we had to come a second time for measurements for alterations .
it did n't look right ... see the attached photo .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
when we returned to our room the hallway smelled like pot .
in addition , the lighting in the room was awful .
really disappointed in my customer service .
the owner then left me and went to help this other customer .
so disappointed in this customer service tonight .
i wanted so badly to love this place .
unfortunately , that was where the good stuff ended .
unbelievably bland , soggy , greasy , limp crust , you name it .
the pizza itself gets zero stars .
however , the food was pretty bad .
the pizza was horrendous , soggy , so greasy , bland cheese .
servers were friendly and came around to pick up dirty plates and such .
do n't use this company , i repeat ... do n't use this company .
my son had a scheduled appointment for this past sunday at 8am .
movers did n't show up till 2pm ... yes 2pm .
the gave some lame excuse about not finishing a job the night before .
keep in mind they have _num_ trucks and its the first day of football .
my guess is they had just _num_ truck working .
we have never had any experience with a moving company before .
it is extremely dishonest behavior .
none of these things have happened .
i wish i could give you zero stars because you deserve it .
this `` pet hospital '' is a scam and a total waste of money .
their vets seem like they barely passed vet school .
seriously ?
- with our plan , we 're supposed to save money .
only in the fine print of our numerous page contract .
- i 'm disappointed with the quality of healthcare the dogs have received .
overall , i 'm convinced banfield and their animal plans are a scam .
we use banfield as our vet and have been very disappointed in this location .
i would rather drive a little further than ever go back to this location .
no big deal .
once again , i kid you not , this one was missing clips .
it 's offensive to me when a company does not value customer service .
i only wish i could play the voicemail for more to hear it .
unfortunately i 'm having to use it in another capacity today .
i recently received poor customer service from hertz in phoenix at their airport location .
it was while cleaning the windshield that i noticed the check engine light on .
i called customer service and was offered a _num_ dollar gift certificate .
unfortunately that employee was the most unprofessional and downright rude of all .
( as in : _num_ stars great ) .
i needed a car and scheduled a rental thru state farm insurance .
enterprise was there in _num_ minutes to pick me up .
avoid this hertz at all costs !
_num_ days went by and i heard nothing .
finally they transferred me to a employee in lost and found .
she was confused how she ended up with my call .
he repeatedly said that there was no way anybody could reverse the transaction .
but regardless , there was no way for me to get a refund .
_num_ months later , i get a refund .
but it was to no surprise that i only received approximately _num_ % returned .
this was a complete rip off .
it is absolutely disappointing in addition to being completely unethical .
horrible !
the rude employee said , `` there are signs everywhere .
i also explained when i rented the vehicle this rule was never mentioned .
it is not about the money .
rude employees !
worst experience ever .
_num_ minute wait to go talk to a person through a kiosk .
i will never use hertz again .
worst customer service .
if you 're too busy to take on new clients let people know .
course is in bad shape .
greens are dried out , dead spots and lines through them .
most of the greens were actually black ... do n't waste your time here .
no grass anywhere including the greens .
you will be disappointed no matter what price you pay .
this is more like a dog track than a golf course .
this course deserves a zero star rating .
unfortunately yelp does n't allow less than one star .
just played it saturday and again was disappointed .
greens are hard as rock and very fast .
customer service is bad .
once they have your money they do n't care .
the owner is greedy with too many tee times too close together .
it took _num_ 1/2 hours to play the course .
even the workers know the owner is greedy and over books tee time .
got to hold number _num_ and had _num_ groups waiting .
had holes with _num_ groups on it .
must have them repaired properly ( if able ) .
can not recommend them unfortunately .
avoid this cleaners !
they have ruined two pieces of clothing .
i would n't recommend them to anyone .
however , after today , not sure that will be the case going forward .
upon picking up my car , it was obvious the rotation was n't done .
when they asked the tech , i was told there was even wear .
probably not coming back again .
no more .
however , after today , not sure that will be the case going forward .
upon picking up my car , it was obvious the rotation was n't done .
when they asked the tech , i was told there was even wear .
probably not coming back again .
could n't be more displeased with jack .
however , he made it seem as if he was knowledgeable .
the agreement was $ _num_ and he presented a bill for $ _num_ .
i took my dog in as he was not acting right .
the initial quote was $ _num_ , not including if surgery was needed .
i did n't care for his bedside manner .
# _num_ the issue i had seen dr. k for has cleared up .
i 'm not .
there is no sense of customer service .
not too thrilled with this vets office .
would n't even put weight down on it .
she did n't even suggest it .
the limp went away and he was back to the normal wally we know .
terrible service .
every time we go in there they always mess up our order .
he said he does n't like dealing with coins .
it smelled like sewage the last time we were in there .
we turned around and walked out .
but not worth the money for hard rice ... .
cheap food done poorly .
wow location stinks .
the kid they have working there has no personality and a bad attitude .
not to mention my vegetable were undercooked and cold and the chicken was cold .
notice that all the _num_ star ratings are older ?
do n't waste _num_ months waiting on broken promises and hard luck stories .
it 's parking is worthless .
i am so appalled by this b and n !
he was so nasty to me and i was nothing but nice and patient .
i will not shop at this store anymore .
shame on b and n to treat me that way .
zero for the customer service .
none in the cafe !
_num_ % only on white dot items .
next morning molly still had trouble standing and walking straight .
my little miss molly went to doggie heaven on new years day .
that part i get ... just bad timing on my part .
they never bothered to call me back .
maybe they just said that to get me out the door .
he was dead the next morning .
what was wrong with our dog ?
then why did we put him down ?
i 'll tell you why : we put him down because he was dying !
awful front desk staff , actually we were dealing with the front desk manager .
as sammy s said in his review they kicked him out !
we immediately asked inside how long it would be going on .
unfortunately , i never even made it to the room due to the construction .
it was not the relaxing weekend i had planned for .
stayed three nights for an on site conference .
insult to injury $ _num_ for a beer .
almost to the point of insulting .
fail .
very disappointed .
nothing except to offer to bring me a small fan and offer apologies .
sheets smelled of mildew and a/c was not properly working .
the restaurant opens ( but mostly closes ) at the convenience of staff .
a vacuum never once touched the carpet in my room .
for $ _num_ to $ _num_ a night i expect a lot more .
fyi ... be ready to walk ... the rooms are very spread out !
it really should be $ $ $ $ $ and $ $ $ $ .
at there mid priced restaurant a filet is $ _num_ .
i would hate to see what the prices are at the high end restaurant .
well if you could squeeze _num_ people in , it would be a stretch .
they are missing the boat here as the bar was tiny .
never did get to buy a drink there .
guess what , no call as to it 's arrival .
_num_ hours later still no box .
to bad , nice grounds , but customers notice what is lacking .
this week we had out of town family visiting from california .
_num_ stars for the resort grounds and view .
as you can tell , the pool caters to families , it happens .
very comfortable lounge chairs and the pool bar staff were prompt and personable .
the whole week it was pretty hit or miss .
what brought it down to _num_ stars was cleanliness .
room service trays sat in the hallway for most of the day .
i just do n't understand how a cleaning crew misses something like that .
i stayed for _num_ nights .
call me picky , but i do n't eat meat .
this is a nice hotel but the staff is a little lacking .
horrible customer service !
the rooms , however left a little to be desired .
staff is excuse oriented instead of results oriented .
it became my _num_ % responsibility to find another hotel .
they even put our luggage in someone else 's room .
you could not make up how badly this hotel fell flat on its face .
this resort gave no such warning .
of course , they had already packed up .
what a bunch of a holes !
maybe they busted me using my own soap and shampoo ?
this place is _num_ star all the way .
i rarely ever write reviews , but i 'm disappointed .
they tend to charge for every little thing without any good reason .
the excuse was that it was during a shift change !
hmmm so why is there a resort fee ?
management was not helpful .
because the reasons i gave above .
from what i can see these are the only redeeming qualities of this hotel .
she said no , it would n't .
all in all , i would not stay here again .
horrible !
horrible !
but that 's not really a compliment .
so , to save _num_ hours would have cost us a cool grand .
we are not seated together in first which is not a big deal .
but we get there _num_ hours early and ask to be put together .
the friendly gal at the check in desk says , sure no problem .
then proceeds to take both our tickets and change my travel companions tickets twice .
they were top notch , but the ground crew is n't supporting them .
i guess that does n't mean much anymore .
_num_ .
of course , when i land , my luggage did n't .
of course , no call .
nobody signed for them even .
_num_ .
no apologies , no refunds , nothing .
i was flying between boston and dallas , stopping at dc national .
again , between boston and dallas , with a stop in philadelphia .
and no , they did n't compensate him for his hotel stay .
i 'm sticking to alaska airlines .
only reason i flew us airways was because i had no choice .
shall we try a little math problem ?
not working ?
zero stars .
maybe jet blue has spoiled me .
but next time i 'll be flying jet blue .
i arrive , and proceed to the e check-in .
it was _num_ minutes to departure and she refused to check me in !
arriving in sf later than 9:30 am was not an option for me .
they of course told me no .
the flight was delayed _num_ hours and i was late anyway !
poor customer service !
this is the worst airline ever .
how can any businesses possibly be such a mess ?
it 's clear this airline does not value their customers .
the flight attendants were so rude on my last flight that it shocked me .
and now you want to charge me $ _num_ for an aisle seat .
this airline also sucks .
good thing i did n't have to deal with them at the counter .
my flight from phoenix to oakland was pretty amazing though .
i ca n't believe i am giving them `` a '' star .
i guess i do n't have a choice .
worst flights ever !
i recently flew us airways from phoenix to chicago .
it was the bargain on hotwire so that is what i went with .
this sucks .
if i could give no stars , i would .
the worst us airline , ever .
neither of these times did she apologize .
rip-off !
you do n't have money to properly maintain your planes ?
i seriously thought i was going to die !
this really made me nervous .
then i paid $ _num_ to check my bag .
i could have been half way to san diego by car .
they did n't communicate to us what would happen to our bags .
this is the worst airline in the entire free world .
they do not know the meaning of the works `` customer service '' .
but this last time really fried me and my traveling companion .
i am not kidding you .
i really ... .
like `` yes to room , no to free tickets ? ''
bad airline !
you will regret it if you do .
this is the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
what is a mother to do .
i called the airport , the airlines , no one could do anything .
i 've flown over a million miles in my career .
could care less if i fly one more mile , especially on useless air .
they just would n't turn off .
there were a few other seats with the same problem .
then , i am told that there is a $ _num_ charge for this !
so much so , i had n't bothered to check this prior to booking .
and i hate you for it .
to make matters worse ?
explain how i can hear that and not blame a lousy corporate culture .
i wish i never had to fly through charlotte or philly again .
this is one of the worst airlines i 've flown with .
almost all airlines allow people to standby for an earlier return flight without charge .
are you kidding me ?
not on this airline !
the employees seemed rather unhappy all-around .
however , the flights themselves were basically decent .
i had the worst nightmare ever !
for _num_ hour !
and then i decide to drive to my destination .
refund or replacement .
another day to catch the next flight to start over again .
crazy and does not make any sense .
which is price for all _num_ flight .
flight and lie to me on the customer service phone .
wont ' let us go on our flight .
a airline have such awful mean disrespect and tricky service .
cuz we check later those flight are all full .
anyone try this airline unless u want to ruin ur trip .
_num_ .
_num_ .
did i mention that the gate agent lady was rude ?
she was being incredibly mean to even smiling , elderly people .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
why would i ever pay more to experience all of the above ?
i have a $ _num_ credit for a flight .
a $ _num_ flight is now going to cost $ _num_ .
american worst airlines has turned to us worst airlines ... yeah !
the last draw was another delayed luggage for _num_ hours via reno .
it turned out to be a pathetic credit to fly the worst airlines .
i returned the voucher way before the expired date .
traveler beware : you want the worst ... you certainly will get it .
just horrible
can i give negative stars ?
three days later is not reasonable !
us airways , you are the absolute worst airline ever !
this airline is america 's worst !
fail .
unfortunately the next flight was n't until _num_ am the next morning .
someone should have been able to assist me by my second call .
that 's not an unreasonable expectation , is it ?
well , not never , but if you have no other choice .
the flight attendants are rude .
no way .
the problem began when the airline boarded the plane without the second pilot .
dont ever fly us airways to hawaii .
the flight attendants were rude and very unpleasant .
well , apparently us airways has not been informed .
what a mess .
service is poor .
we should not support such poor service .
i arrived alive .
thats the only positive thing i have to say about this airline .
with out a doubt , the worst in the industry .
it is the corporate culture that stinks .
the cleanliness of the plane is questionable .
many times i have gotten to my seat to find trash .
then , the over all care for the interior is lacking .
i guess for me with flying its the little things that make a difference .
_num_ stars .
i guess i always go through this with airlines .
first , i hate paying for luggage fees .
i mean it 's bad enough that you 're flying in the first place .
no good .
i was n't going to any of those places .
is n't it your job to book flights with your airline ?
even after i explained my situation .
and none of them were asked for a return flight .
us airways is a disaster .
i am really disappointed in this company , my husband 's mother died suddenly .
it is pretty obvious that they do not care about their customers at all .
this airline is awful .
during a recent trip , i was charged $ _num_ to change my ticket .
the planes to hawaii are so old and beaten up , it 's embarrassing .
even most of the employees say that us airways is n't great .
us airways is by far the worst airline i have ever traveled on .
please do n't make the same mistake we did .
so many bad experiences , i ca n't name them all .
my drinks came in glass , not us air 's fine first class plastic .
i wish i could award no stars .
i hate the fact that this is my `` hometown airline '' .
terrible reward program .
horrible customer service .
i do n't know where to begin with this review .
you know , we could have all used some more sleep time .
what i received was worse .
excuse me ?
why do n't you call me back when it 's fixed ?
the next day , i started over from scratch .
richard said `` no problem '' .
yes , $ _num_ more than what they ended up giving us .
terrible experience .
i recently visited the us airways club in the lower number a concourse .
worst airline ever !
_num_ days before my flight out , i did not feel well .
just awful customer service .
no snacks , no tv screens , no blankets , no pillows .
the plane heading to and from san jose , ca was dirty .
does n't anyone do a quick check when they turn a plane over .
maybe the flight attendants should do a quick check .
us airways track record with me is _num_ % .
flew _num_ flights in the last week .
the same thing happens , but now there is something wrong with the a/c .
but one thing airline need to and should change is their bag policy !
he gave me a card with the website address to take care of it .
not us air .
do not recommend .
having a miserable experience flying from boston to reno .
sorry buddy , not really fine .
i missed my flight by _num_ minutes .
will avoid them at all costs !
us airways cancelled my flight from las vegas to houston with very little warning .
had i received more advanced notice , i would 've adjusted my plans .
hats off to her , she takes us airways from _num_ to _num_ stars .
southwest , united , continental ... anything but us airways .
very unimpressive experience .
free shirt if you sign up in the terminal .
something like : `` bite me . ''
i booked a flight for my daughter over a month early through expedia .
the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
they give these out in hopes that people do n't use them i guess .
never again us air , i will only fly southwest .
i have never had more problems with an airline like this one .
the flight was delayed so much that i missed my connecting flight in phoenix .
they are very unorganized and i will never fly them again .
it was only for $ _num_ off .
worst airline ever !
so $ _num_ later to be booked on a flight the next day .
not even close .
surely this is just a mistake .
so , i politely talked to a boarding agent .
i doubt i 'll be flying with them , again .
really like their low prices .
us airways is probably the worst airlines i 've ever flown on .
3rd time and 3rd delayed flight .
however , my return flight shook my faith in this mode of transportation .
we lost are already paid for seats .
clearly some employee training is overdue here .
i have to say in life i try not to hate things .
mixed messages , rude staff , broken seats are all par for the course .
had the same issue with the _num_ minute prior check-in .
i do n't blame her , _num_ pound over really ?
it made for a chaotic and cranky crowd .
terrible flight .
avoid , awful .
other airlines do not have this ridiculously strict policy .
alright i could work with that .
you 're providing a service , not a death sentence .
if i could write a review sans stars , i would .
and it almost seems as though they 're proud of their poor reputation .
no luck .
alas , no dice .
rude staff .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
oh i forgot how much i hate you !
your staff is rude .
one even offered to buy me a drink .
the incident gave us a very poor image of us airways .
update to this ... _num_ days later ... two more calls .
its all like they just want to be as unhelpful as possible .
my expectations for airline travel are quite low .
i should never have to sit in a middle seat .
that is unreasonable and leaves no room for error .
i have missed my connection multiple times due tight scheduling by us airways .
lame .
as it is you just lost six .
nothing is new here about my bad experience .
mechanical failure .
flight was delayed in palm springs .
i missed the connection in phoenix .
a delay of _num_ hours .
i always avoid us worst but sometimes it 's just impossible .
i thought i still can get my benefit on us worst .
i have experienced nightmares on more than _num_ % of us worst flights .
more so lately ... _num_ % in past _num_ years ( _num_ flights ) .
_num_ ) us worst does not recognize the full status of united premier .
not like united and continental .
_num_ ) it 's business as usual for us worst .
too bad !
the mechanic failure and that delayed flight did not qualify for any compensation .
customer service was pretty rotten .
to our horror an easy one hour layover turned into _num_ hours at phoenix .
you will save some money though .
my flight was delayed by an hour and late into denver .
disorganized lines at check-in .
my associate claimed it was n't her fault .
but i will avoid us airways from now on .
it is one of the worst ever airport agent experiences .
i was expecting some kind of half way sorry .
but , what i got was `` we can not compensate anything '' .
us airways phoenix is a scam bag , misleading and horrible to their customers .
i 'm sorry you were not able to check in for your flight .
i get screwed !
they put me up in a crap hotel in phoenix .
the planes carpet is stained and old .
check-in , go through security with no problems .
no big deal .
6:00 am : flight delayed another _num_ minutes .
7:00 am : flight delayed _num_ minutes .
8:00 am : after two hours , we finally board .
8:30 am : en route to phoenix .
also realize i 'm never flying us again !
not cool .
one of the worst in the us .
in line with other awful airlines like united or american .
it turned a cheap , fun trip into a really crap experience .
ridiculous .
two thumbs way down .
if you hate your jobs that bad then go pick fruit .
i am not impressed at all .
but i have no choice cuz i have to fly to phoenix .
if i had another choice , i would not fly with us air .
service is bad .
do n't know how they remain in business .
no , they do not talk to people .
they can only be reached via the automated contact form on the site .
it 's a wonderful way to waste the last day of my vacation .
and do they offer any sort of compensation for wasting my day ?
i 'm not even sure i got a proper apology .
i will avoid flying with them in the future .
we can put in a generic request .
think twice before booking a flight from us airways operated by a foreign airline .
actually , do n't even think about it .
just do n't do it !
if you hate your job that much then find a new one !
horrible !
i think they said another _num_ minute delay at least _num_ times .
i flew my _num_ lb .
told me i could not have one because i had a pet .
in the bag and it was rudely taken from me .
all that most of us expect is to be treated simply as a customer .
they want to collect more money to check in baggage .
i have had a sub-par experience every time i have flown .
the delay would have caused us to miss the connection .
looked at united and the ticket was over $ _num_ .
grumpy , unfriendly , blah .
worst flying experience of my life .
i was flying san jose to phoenix , phoenix to charlotte .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
the worst flight experience ever .
i was on a _num_ hour flight and guess what , no snacks !
i just do n't understand why they do n't feed me ?
forget your flight leaving on time or having your baggage when you get there .
they had three chances to get it right , and struck out every time .
they should honor the united baggage rules when a ticket was purchased through united .
ca n't stand the service .
horrible bag service !
the gate should have been ready .
there were others on my plane that were not going to be so lucky .
the customer service was terrible .
some woman working at the counter name jessica m was horrible .
her attitude was so nasty .
there is too much competition out there to deal with that .
this airline is poorly operated ; the concept of customer service does not exist .
stay away from this airline .
how convenient .
boarding passes that they took from us and refused to give back .
the bathroom toilet would not flush in the front of the plane .
the sink in the bathroom was full of water that would not drain .
meh , i think i 'll pass .
the worst tea i 've ever tasted .
the whole experience just seemed a little run down .
_num_ .
_num_ .
no big deal - i just wasted a few $ and instead drove .
imagine my surprise when i found out they cancelled my return flight to phoenix .
i did n't panic , just called them to have it corrected .
i replied that 's ok , i already paid for my ticket .
he said that was n't their policy blah , blah , blah .
instead , us airways charged me a 2nd time for my ticket home .
that is offensive .
really wish i could give them zero stars .
there were _num_ of us .
this was horrible treatment .
it was extremely disappointing .
the planes are run down , the customer service people were rude and insulting .
i do n't even know where to begin .
i booked my flight july 16th from az to mi for christmas .
i try to check in again online and i am unable to .
the seat i booked and paid for over _num_ months prior .
i was offered a hotel and a 7am flight to phoenix .
i try again to check in online for my morning flight and can not .
i get _num_ hours of sleep and off to the airport for my flight .
i think i would 've rather drove the _num_ miles .
they would not fly us to another airport on flights that had seats .
another thing i hated was the credit card push .
never again , us airways .
my son : _num_ ; daughter : _num_ years old .
it was _num_ hours flight from phx to buffalo , ny .
called them back in _num_ mins .
despite booking a seat in first class , she could not have cared less .
i 'm going to get home tonight on southwest .
i deserve better treatment than this .
never again .
rude !
on flight they yelled at me for having tray table down .
they look at the passengers and treat them like they are idiots .
they seem to think they are better than everyone else .
never even an apology - no service recovery attempt at all .
use a competitor - you 'll be better off .
$ _num_ each for the upgrade for a _num_ hour flight was a disappointment .
felt like southwest airlines to me .
price not worth it .
( our flight want scheduled to leave for _num_ minutes . )
terrible service !
you have got to be freakin ' kidding me !
just over ten hours after he arrived at the phoenix airport !
the ticket agent that ended up helping us gets _num_ stars .
but this airline does not .
but this was not mentioned whatsoever !
ridiculous .
sharing my experience .
customer service said they could not let me on the plane .
i am stuck in phoenix for the night .
_num_ .
_num_ .
a minute late to the gate seems ridiculous to not allow me on .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
if the airline would like to reach out to me feel free .
i was in no mood for jokes .
a very bad one , middle seat in the back .
no rude employees ... just cold and uncaring .
what an embarrassment .
why not just schedule the first flight for 7:00 .
disappointing first experience with us air , which will also be my last .
they are not covering my dinner .
so ... not happy , bob .
why did i try another airline southwest ?
without a doubt the worst commercial airline i have been on in years .
the service and attitude of the employees sucks .
then the last people to board must check their carry on .
people should expect some customer service from a business , including us air .
you wo n't get it .
they are only interested in making additional money rather than doing what is right .
very disappointing and deserves no stars !
this has to be the worst commercial airline i have been on in years .
the service and attitude of the employees was horrible .
then the last people to board must check their carry on .
!
you wo n't get it .
shoe maker operation !
it was painful .
lastly , the restroom floors are covered in a sticky layer of piss !
i 'm sorry for your experience .
moreover , i regret our flight attendant failed to follow-up with you .
us airways is just terrible .
i 'm so thankful for alaska airlines .
what 's wrong with upper management of airlines ?
then on the first flight we had an exit row which was very cold .
to follow the flight attendants we rude or very short .
the flight back was a bit more annoying .
i know airlines are trying to save money but that is just downright cheap !
i 'll choose another , less stingy , airline in the future .
this is the worst airline service i had experienced in usa .
i booked a flight from los angeles to san antonio .
i had a _num_ mins connecting flight to san antonio at phoenix airport .
the first flight was delayed and i requested for changing flight .
the worst customer i ever had in my life .
worst airport terminal !
this is the worst airline ever .
i 'm so sorry your experience with us was disappointing .
terrible customer service .
i will be sure to remind us airways potential customers of this often .
worst .
oh there it is .
there will be no further communication from our office regarding this matter . ''
they will be absolutely useless to me for summer travel .
purchased _num_ ' , would get _num_ ' extra .
only _num_ ' has been added to my balance .
it 's like the people working there are incompetent and ... incompetent .
there 's no other word for it .
it was completely empty .
freaking wasted my time !
and that 's why so many people like singapore airlines .
add this airline to my no fly list along with spirit .
not there fault .
worst customer service i 've ever experienced with an airline .
lame but what the heck can one do but hope for a safe flight .
_num_ min before boarding they want people to give up their seats .
no bueno .
united airlines compared to this airline .
i do n't want to go on a plane that is going to crash .
that would suck worse .
my flight got sent to another gate and another plane .
wish me luck .
well , neither is the ac .
should i up my review ?
it 's only _num_ hours and _num_ minutes late ( so far ) .
but , i doubt it .
not even a free drink on board .
the line to check a bag was extremely long .
it seems that whoever created those things wanted everyone to die .
the flight attendants were okay , and the plane landed on time .
complaint : poor quality service !
_num_ .
_num_ .
nothing was said or done by the flight crew .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
there is no phone number to contact a real person .
terrible service , poor communication from the airlines to the passengers .
quick update , _num_ hours later , still waiting for the flight to tucson .
this is by far the worst airline !
i have been stuck here for almost _num_ hours with no explanation !
rude .
bad customer service .
no charging stations .
cranky flight attendants .
lesson learned : avoid at all costs in the future .
i really hate this airline .
they are a bunch of rude flight attendant .
what a disaster .
we flew from san francisco to london , stopping on philadelphia .
for a _num_ hour flight , you need something to eat .
there was no special meal .
with no food , i became physically ill .
no meal again .
the representative blame me for not having a meal .
i should have requested _num_ hours in advance .
i requested repeatedly and more than _num_ hours in advance .
if there is a reply , i will update .
other foreign companies can , why ca n't american companies do it ?
they do n't care , i believe .
why would you load up a plane that 's not ready to fly ?
sitting on a plane for _num_ hours to work on maintenance is unacceptable .
if it 's not ready to fly ... do n't load up passengers .
ridiculous !
what poor customer service from beginning to end !
the worst .
at this point , i freaked .
the rule is you wait until _num_ minutes before -- not _num_ .
wrong again .
customer service is where things took a really , really horrible turn .
i have never been treated in such a disgusting way in my life .
she explained that no changes could be made .
with tears flowing and my birthday weekend ruined , we waited it out .
worst birthday weekend ever .
i will not fly them ever again !
the check in and boarding was as average as they come .
there is nothing else to say about that .
the plane sucked .
also , they charge $ _num_ per bag at check in .
that 's so ridiculous .
us airways caused me to miss an important flight out of sky harbor airport .
they gave me a number to call to receive my refund .
why were they dishonest with me in the first place ?
last time i waste my money with your company .
they 're not - even the pilot is standing in the gate area .
my question is , why did n't us airways alert its customers immediately ?
that was just the beginning of what turned out to be a horrible night .
needless to say , my wife and i were , too .
the shuttle driver actually fell asleep at a stop sign .
he was literally asleep at the wheel .
perhaps using the renaissance would n't have been such a bad idea .
i was forced to miss a day of work .
my wife was forced to miss a day of work .
worst airline ever .
they constantly lose my bags , and are rarely on time .
horrible airline , flight attendants are rude and unprofessional .
as far as i am concerned they need to be put out of business .
my husband had his number , but not mine .
not so .
the gate agent said they closed the doors and we could not get on .
all clothes had to be washed or dry cleaned .
unbelievable .
meanwhile , we had an emergency at home and had to cancel the trip .
they did refund the tax , but only on request .
i wo n't hold my breath .
this is shady business practices and seems like it must be illegal to me .
you ca n't get paid twice by renting out the same seats .
i will find another airline for my next trip .
never would i suggest there services .
Negative
wish there was negative stars .
why am i forced to suffer cause she messed up .
should have gotten me on another airline .
never really apologized .
no one could give me her managers name .
now sitting in terminal for _num_ minutes .
gate agent has n't got a clue .
this air line is the worst .
never flying us airways again .
they boarded us anyway rather than provide a different plane .
by the time we took off i had developed a _num_ fever .
i do not fly domestic enough to know what is the standard .
i will not fly us airways again .
overall just unhappy staff .
$ _num_ to check any baggage .
i will not fly this airline every again .
never have i flown us airlines until today and boy do i regret it .
my flight did not start boarding until _num_ minutes after the scheduled boarding time .
to add more stress i had a connecting flight ( same airline ) .
yup , you guessed it i did not make it in time .
doors closed therefore not able to get into the plane .
nothing to show their concern for their customers .
communicate that with connecting flights .
this is the worst experience i have ever had with an airline .
i had _num_ flights delays for _num_ hours or more !
i 'm very familiar with airline operations , procedures , and customer service .
i quit buying tickets on them years ago .
no gate agent .
myself and another passenger from the cancelled flight were waiting to check in .
she said she did n't have time .
jet boarded , closed up _num_ min .
prior to departure time and left with lots of empty seats .
she did n't have time .
i so wish that i could give zero stars .
thank you for wasting my time you idiots .
total bs from this airline .
they try to sell you everything even , different seats have higher prices .
absolutely annoying .
they are all getting worse .
horrible customer service .
why would i put my belongings in garbage bag to get tossed around ?
never been so literally disgusted time and time again with the service .
on december _num_ i took my family to hi for christmas vacation .
i would not recommend flying us airways or american airlines ever !
poor service , _num_ % chance of delay and they do n't care .
always a bad time and i 'm always angry .
this is the greyhound bus of the airline world .
avoid if possible .
fail fail fail !
they offered $ _num_ voucher if you gave up your seat !
booked with a _num_ hour layover .
no problem , just go to the gate .
even us airways customer service agents on site did n't understand .
super disappointed .
just plain ugly corporate america .
can not recommend .
do no use this airline .
this has been a nightmare !
she had no idea of when the next flight would leave .
she did not need to yell at me or be so rude .
i 've never really had any problems with this company until now .
we were n't allowed to board the plane until the _num_ attendant was present .
all three flights experienced significant delays , two for mechanical reasons .
this time it 's weather causing the problem .
ca n't blame us airways for that .
a worst in the airline industry phone app , however , makes things worse .
attendants arrived and could n't tell anyone anything .
why does it cost so much to be treated like dirt ?
they just left me stranded .
the flight attendants on the first flight were so mean and rude .
( only _num_ minutes late ) .
they just left me stranded .
no communication at all from the us airways as to why that was .
after switching terminals all customers received a limited $ _num_ food voucher .
southwest gave me $ _num_ last time a flight was delayed this much .
i will be removing them from our preferred vendor list for my entire hospital .
i want to use companion certificate .
no explanation of why long wait lines .
no option for a call back .
really , customer service is apparently dead with this company .
total crap airline .
do n't do it , not worth it .
plane was old as dirt too .
if you are flying us air in phoenix today .
phoenix airport is fucking big .
horrible , if you have a different choice , take it .
so they changed our gate but we did n't see that sign .
the counter guy at customer service said we should have looked at the sign .
i hate giving bad reviews but it is what it is .
this has to be the worst encounter i have ever had at this airport .
the worst i 've ever experienced .
pathetic .
they use mesa to operate flights out of phoenix .
mesa is a disorganized mess .
they canceled my connecting flight and notified me at the last minute .
they basically ruined my short trip home for easter because of the situation .
terrible experience .
at this point i might as well rent a car and drive myself home .
_num_ sad star for us air .
we were at the airport _num_ hours before our flight .
i will never fly your airline again ... no matter what !
the worst fucking airline in the usa !
no exit row after i was on the plane .
embarrassed me , treated me like a piece of crap !
horrible service !
then they tell me it was my fault that because i am tall .
i do n't know they currently have _num_ stars .
do not , i repeat , do not make my mistake .
they do n't take your health into account .
situation : flight delayed , missed a connecting flight .
the best they can do is _num_ % off your next ticket .
no upgrades or improvements were made .
refused to let us get off the plane .
the in flight staff were rude and dismissive .
good to know he is n't on any sort of a schedule .
never , ever again .
hands down the worst travel experience of my entire life .
i missed my own wedding because of us airways .
the flight that was booked for me gave _num_ minutes to transfer planes .
she had zero compassion or empathy .
i could not believe my ears .
giving _num_ star was far too much .
thanks for nothing .
they 're horrible .
every time i have flown this airline , they have been late .
no exception .
i try to avoid them like the plague .
to make matters worse , they do n't even care .
their business model sucks .
and the people are rude .
i wasted _num_ hours of my day .
paid for a first class ticket and only got coach .
wo n't fly with them ever again .
yes , over $ _num_ and crappy service .
literally the worst airlines to ever fly with .
we were not even offered a free pack of chips .
i tried to talk to the employees again and they are so rude .
i went to customer service to see if i could get on stand by .
it was the worst customer service i have ever experience .
kit seems as long as there was one seat left we were waiting .
flight crew was half rude .
worst airline ever .
of course i said excuse me ?
i have had this card just over _num_ years .
this airline is ridiculous !
this entire ordeal makes no sense .
worst customer service ever !
even though i made it on time ... my seat was given away .
i will fly alaska .
what a waste of my time and patience !
after _num_ hours waiting while they did maintenance , they finally cancelled the flight .
well , i guess i could fly to st. paul .
no luggage .
well , thought wrong , did i .
they saw no reason i should need a hotel .
but incompetence and horrible customer service with no regard for the customer is not .
this airline has been consistently terrible .
this cost us 4-5 hours of our time .
lazy : the gate employee sent me to customer service .
she said she would help me now ( why not earlier ? )
ignorant : she said there was room for us .
before i lay she apologize and said she was wrong .
not enough seats .
never had worst service in my life .
only to find it was a 1/2 hour late which turned into _num_ hour .
one star for cheap flights .
!
_num_ times this year _num_ business trips and one personal .
had a delayed flight friday that caused me to miss a connecting flight .
it stinks , but it happens .
horrible experience .
worst customer service i 've ever experienced .
rudest person i 've ever encountered .
horrible !
terrible customer service .
worse thing is they still would have been on time !
_num_ pm the worst !
the next available flight is at midnight . ''
not a bit of concern or empathy was displayed .
not one showed any sense of urgency to get people on their way .
the people they bumped were treated extremely poorly .
i would give a _num_ star if possible !
do not spend your money with us airways .
there was a green stink bug crawling on the seat .
she was super rude !
really upsetting .
i wish i could give this ppl zero stars .
not a chance with us air - just terrible .
just terrible customer service .
then , jennifer , does n't let up on it .
terrible service !
very poor customer service and rude employees .
i took a _num_ hour flight and it was miserable .
second flight this week over _num_ hours delayed because they have no crew !
this is why i almost always fly southwest .
my _num_ year old daughter flew from boston to phx .
of course , she missed her connection .
we have been screwed more times than we can count by this horrible airline .
no such luck .
last week we flew from phoenix to florida .
a little confusing and delays are expected i guess .
the most uncomfortable seating i have ever seen .
get outta here !
that 's why we 're delayed ?
they just left us all stranded at the airport .
terrible airlines .
and it is not my responsibility to ask passengers to switch with me .
the worst airline ever ... .
it is a shame you are here in phoenix .
biggest waste of time i 've ever seen .
not a good way to end my vacation .
worst airline ever taken !
do not bother wasting your money .
but what was really horrible was coming back .
i booked using expedia , saved over half what they tried to charge .
just writing this review makes me ill wo n't travel with them again .
Neutral
does n't deserve zero stars !
this is the worst flight i have ever been on !
worst airline ever .
no air conditioning on flight from palm springs to phoenix in august .
it smelled like a locker room after only a one hour flight .
the attendant with no compassionate all !
i felt yelp was a better forum .
if given the option do n't fly us airways / american airlines .
_num_ hr delay and counting so far .
i could have driven to vegas .
this is the worst airline ever .
arrived _num_ minutes early and arrived at the gate _num_ minutes late .
just a horrible airline .
miserable airline that cares absolutely nothing about customer service .
last time on the same flight it was almost _num_ hours .
shoddy business .
i will literally never stop until this is resolved .
clearly i can not trust american airlines to refund my money so i declined .
i did nothing wrong !
i will not do it .
was anyone ever going to contact me ?
or was american expecting me to just mail them in and forget ?
i can not believe that was offered .
$ _num_ for _num_ sets of doors .
so far it has been _num_ weeks with no answer .
the home story doors are not .
apparently they did not need our business .
however , the course was horrible .
it 's an $ _num_ round at best .
pretty rough shape and ugly to boot .
lots of dirt - ugly .
one water hole .
we purchased this groupon for $ _num_ .
this gave us a day of golf , cart , range balls and lunch .
the range had no grass besides where you were hitting from .
you would expect signs leading you to the first hole but there was not .
this course was in horrible condition .
first off , there is dirt everywhere around this course .
but viewing them , it looked like an old dried up river .
this happened on the 2nd hole while we were playing .
over all the course was just awful .
the worst i have played in the valley .
we will not be going back .
it 's unfortunate because the course has potential .
unfortunately the playing area was just horrible .
were spot on .
gave it _num_ stars .
yup , a ball washer .
there was not a single ball washer on the course - not one !
folks , this course was bad !
bad , bad , bad .
i took one bite , and into the trash with the rest of it .
nor was he helpful .
very poor customer service .
the whole time , there were no other ppl around .
i dont want special service or treatment but i know when im not welcome .
for all the other options in phx , i wont be returning here .
this place should pay you to waste your time .
this course should really be embarrassed to even be part of golf now .
the worst ever .
not the best conditioned course for sure .
but for that amount i 'm definitely not expecting a _num_ star course .
it was n't challenging enough for me .
a thing which is not , however , indicated on their website .
we got bored really quickly and just wandered around .
you do n't really get better than that .
i will probably never go here again .
we are poor , but i would never waste my money here .
totally not worth the drive from scottsdale .
instead , we just found rough .
by the way , $ _num_ entry fee .
it is dirty and dingy .
restroom counter needed to be wiped down .
it was busy but not overwhelming .
pretty fun breakfast with my fav 's .
if it 's your cheat day , def try the cinnamon roll .
well , sausage i guess . ''
unfortunately this is the only good thing about our breakfast .
one bit was enough and this went back , no additional items were ordered .
the hollandaise sauce made at the good egg tasted like chicken broth gravy .
cost for these _num_ cups of disgusting coffee was $ _num_ .
maybe they need help from gordon ramsey as this is certainly a kitchen nightmare .
the portions at good egg are not that big ... .
it over-priced & you really do n't get a whole lot of food !
it always seems cold or lukewarm , too .
please try ihop just down the damn street on central .
believe me , it is way better than good egg .
poor service , poor food .
prices have gone up and food quantity and quality have suffered greatly !
when the food is gets to the table , it is usually cold .
disgusting !
the eggs benedict was covered in a flavorless and odd colored hollandaise sauce .
this place sucks !
well , have cold eggs , cold potato 's , and cold toast !
horrible coffee and very expensive !
needless to say i was completely turned off by the meal .
meanwhile , my husband had received his meal and had not gotten any syrup .
another guy sent his glasses back because they were dirty .
the terrible egg ... .
our food came out cold , dry , and , burnt !
come on now lady !
i was definitely disappointed .
a crepe egg is whipped egg whites with a crepe .
however , she requested it to be on white toast instead .
the bread came out burnt and too dry .
the mayo was barely visible ... it was pretty much inedible sandwich .
it was n't anything spectacular as that can be ordered just about anywhere .
they did not do well .
they totally screwed my order up and then just seemed indifferent to it .
just awful .
will not be back .
i was n't .
the omelet was flat and bland .
i probably wo n't go here again .
party of _num_ .
rude and unprofessional .
btw , eggs benedict and coffee with tip was $ _num_ wasted dollars .
upon entering , i was ignored by everyone .
she said , '' uh , no , ya you can sit there . ''
it was eggs and a tortilla , for goodness ' sake .
it makes you feel uncomfortable knowing the staff has no desire to help .
it 's not like i want to be here all day or anything ! ''
they reply no .
the woman says , '' will i get kicked out at 2:30 ? ''
he says , '' well , um , no . ''
more like bad egg .
feels like , looks like , and tastes like a cafeteria .
oatmeal was dry ; i had to add a lot of the milk .
biscuits were large but horribly dry .
gravy barely had any sausage in it .
no big deal , mistakes happen .
but an apology from management would 've been nice .
wo n't be back .
i went in just wanting some scrambled eggs and home fried potatoes to go !
bland , cold , slow , and bland !
but wait ... whats that ?
frozen food bland to be honest .
cold food !
crazy bland , cold food , cold waiting staff , and bland again .
explains why they have so much hot sauce and ketchup on the table .
this place was gross and sad .
the only good part about the meal was the coffee .
i wish we would have gone to the jamba juice next door .
this was restaurant was a bad egg .
i did n't like this place at all .
eggs were flavorless .
biscuits and gravy were dry .
wo n't be returning .
horrible experience .
three waitresses walked by us and did not even acknowledge us .
never going back .
staff not engaged or interested in customers .
it was n't even that busy .
food was marginal and service was horrendous .
we waited _num_ minutes at our table and no one came over to us .
no i am sorry for the delay or anything .
no sense of urgency on her part .
did n't know the good egg was a serve yourself cafe .
might as well lose the servers and just order at a window like mcdonalds .
ridiculous !
my partner ordered a wheat pancake which looked like it was cooked days before .
potatoes were mushy like baby food .
seemed to be very chaotic and unorganized .
my partner let her know that the service was not good .
the woman said nothing like she did not give a damn .
no apology or sorry for our experience .
how is that our problem .
shame on you good egg .
hire some employees who care about their jobs and customers .
warning dine here at your own risk .
if i could give this experience no stars i would .
wrong !
-no return !
too many other wonderful places to go now that phoenix has grown .
very sad !
so sad , was a good breakfast place .
the service was not good .
they told us _num_ minutes for seating , it took an hour .
missing one set of silverware for a party of five .
did not have kale for one of their juice drinks .
try the hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict if you want to get sick .
i do n't see i said that in my post .
it took _num_ minutes to get seated .
$ _num_ on the table for the tip .
was never refilled .
what was worse was the water .
our glasses of water and we were out .
it was n't the worst i have ever had but i def .
wo n't be back .
usually this place is ok.
bad day today .
beware : the photos online are much better than reality .
it all seemed very blah .
overall , i would n't stay here if i had a choice .
you are looking dated and tired .
ick !
i wish i would have learned that ahead of time .
avoid at all cost .
eh , uh , meh .
this one is my least favorite hyatt locations .
just kinda awkward .
for _num_ beer .
called front desk , they sent someone up .
took _num_ minutes , but they fixed it at least .
_num_ stars on a hyatt scale .
i stayed here for a business convention for _num_ nights .
yes , atrium is hotel for `` noisy . ''
very , very loud .
gross .
so they should call maintenance to fix it .
( it really was that bad . )
the attention to detail just was n't there .
last , the check in process is just bizarre .
what a horrible place to stay .
we just wanted to drop off bags and they would not open the gate .
not the service i expected !
never going to stay at hyatt again .
first arrival a nightmare .
not told attendant what she said he said no .
the breakfast pics are great but the actual food is not .
we tried this restaurant on two separate occasions and had problems each time .
very nice staff at this hotel .
kids , there are no towel bars or racks in the bathroom .
you ca n't hang a towel up even if you want to .
no information on the business center or amenities or hours in the room .
ick , is all i can say .
booked directly with hyatt for a conference i was attending .
i was tires and just feel asleep .
this is probably the worst hyatt i 've ever stayed !
the hotel is so outdated and is not well maintained at all .
the carpet is dirty and has huge stains .
even the ceiling in my room is dirty .
gross !
i would n't even pay $ _num_ a night for it .
it is so sad for the hyatt brand .
horrible hotel , will never return !
aside from that , the walls are very thin .
( 9th floor ) - two hours before my alarm clock !
i will not be staying here again .
very cheap tables .
but i did n't expect that warm welcome .
she left for vacation without ever getting back to me .
pretty disappointed overall .
expensive for the lack of amenities .
parking was $ _num_ and daily wifi was $ _num_ .
even motel _num_ has free wifi !
for this , i rate them a _num_ star .
please save your time , money and frustration and book elsewhere .
Negative
+ the views are great from the rooms
- the parking is _num_ with no ins & outs .
front desk was less than helpful checking in .
not very safe !
the bad : they charge for wifi !
pool sucks , parking is $ _num_ a night at the hotel .
the iron sucks .
how far this company has fallen .
it is like being at motel _num_ .
enterprise rental , on the premises , was of no help whatsoever .
one employee named ryan working at the bag holding area stood out .
probably wont be staying here again .
starbucks coffee and condiments in room appear older than me .
the lobby was very updated however the room was setup awkward .
what hotel does n't have free parking ?
the hotel staff is very rude .
the hotel itself is ok.
overall , i would not stay here again .
i should have stayed at the renaissance .
they have better reviews and i should have listened to them .
i travel to arizona every month for a week for work .
because again could n't get in touch with anyone at the front desk .
i like to eat healthy and this hotel has nothing but burgers and fries .
stayed here labor day weekend was very disappointed .
go to take shower and soap scum stuck to wall of shower so disgusting .
had my room switched .
walking to nearby restaurants did n't feel safe after 4pm .
food in the hotel restaurant bar was poor .
the television in the room did n't work for _num_ days .
i would not return to stay in the downtown phoenix area after this experience .
made a reservation today at _num_ pm for the same day .
family emergency caused me to have to cancel them _num_ pm .
ridiculously horrible customer service .
they will take every chance they can to rip you off .
the rooms are boring , small and not nice .
the sheets on the bed were smoky smelling , so i took them off .
the pillow are terrible .
there was no hot water for a shower in the morning .
the food is miserable and really bad in the restaurant .
the service again lacking very much .
should have stayed at the sheraton ... never again .
shower had mold stains around tub .
not having enough natural light in the room during the day was depressing .
overall , we had a yucky room and i would not stay here again .
unfriendly staff , unimpressive room .
do n't plan on taking hot shower .
so i got really annoyed .
she apologized and promised to get me my food asap .
half an hour later , my cold bacon burger arrived without bacon .
customer service not what i expected for the price .
the electrical outlets were terrible , though .
the other outlets were n't much better .
the common areas were a little nicer , though very much business hotel bland .
i avoided the rotating restaurant on the top floor .
the elevators in this hotel were remarkably slow .
this hyatt was just dated and not to hyatt standards .
we will not stay here again in the future .
and we want to say that staying here was terrible experience to us .
we have complained front desk many times but their action was too late .
clearly not focused on the satisfaction of their guests .
june _num_ check in and june 5th check out .
all the hotels are booked and i could not cancel my reservations .
this is complete bullshit .
this is my hotel room ?
i quickly lower it as far as possible .
this is what $ _num_ valet get you here .
what the hell .
i noticed they dragged in the roll out bed which is falling apart .
i go to sleep and wake up hot .
_num_ degrees ?
i would not recommend staying here .
little do the know i took pictures and you can see the crap .
hyatt not too smart at all .
i have _num_ customers viewing my review in just a few days .
ok so when i go in it is almost 2pm .
i decided on the gyro and the fries , no drink @ $ _num_ .
typical lunch prices .
wish me luck !
fast , friendly service , but the food was kinda gross .
i 'm a burger lover and this was just terrible .
the meat was gray and tasteless .
coworker and i went for lunch .
today , i opted for hot dogs with a side of potato salad .
for $ _num_ each , i was not too pleased .
i think i will stick to the burgers from now on .
literally something i could have whipped up on my grill at home .
caramelized onions , tomatoes , peppers , and chicken .
but with tax and delivery , it was probably more like $ _num_ .
wo n't order here again .
the chili looked more like a mystery meat light brown gravy sauce .
i could n't eat my other hot dog and threw it away !
my husbands gyro was extremely lacking !
did not even have lettuce in it !
was extremely unimpressed with this place and never going there again !
the dodge theater ) .
i have been drinking there for almost a decade .
sorry bud .
only reason they get two stars ?
this place is truly awful .
this review is based on the place as a drinking establishment .
he said `` oops '' and gave us a refund for the other _num_ .
ordered the mushroom burger , they put canned mushrooms on the burger .
gross !
but it 's really hard to mess up a patty melt .
the restroom stunk like old piss .
food was nothing special .
_num_ stars .
when it came to me i knew there was going to be some problems .
this was no corned beef i 've ever seen .
this is a pub , not a restaurant .
the atmosphere is faux irish pub .
the waitresses were rude .
apparently serving customers was not part of their job description .
either way in three trips , they were always there and annoying as hell .
the food is ... meh ( to quote my rating ) .
i had the chicken parmesan , i am pretty sure it was chicken tenders .
either way it was not anything special .
not a bad place to go to before going to a game or show .
it wo n't be as busy as the spots right down town .
if it is busy though , do n't wait .
you 'll only get angry that you waited .
i ca n't decide which is worse ... the food or the service .
as for the food , the shepherd 's pie is a big no !
how can you mess up shepherd 's pie ?
the waitress still is not back !
kind of a forgettable experience as far as irish pubs go .
i 'm not .
and not because it was rotten , but because it was that bad .
6th stop of the dine around .
i 'm not sure why some are raving about the fish and chips .
i would say skip the food and come here for a few beers .
the manager was not very interested in my opinion on app .
frozen potato skins as well .
slow and unfriendly service .
took _num_ minutes just to get drinks .
this is just another trash bar in downtown .
the service was so bad we did not even get past the first drink .
we immediately handed the darts back , demanded the license and left .
there are much better places to spend your money .
avoid it if you can !
stopped in for what would thought would be some great fish and chips .
seems he is n't , but is allowing people to think he is .
unfortunately , the service is absolutely awful .
it 's honestly the worst .
i didnt know at the time that she worked there .
this is not ok.
terrible .
i will never step foot into this establishment again .
i will be sending this story to _num_ on your side .
angry server , terrible food but great beers .
no one at this place can or has or will ever be able to .
i saw this girl for _num_ min and was asked to leave .
he did n't care .
this is why you establishment sucks .
( we were there when it was free .
if we go back , we 're not ordering food !
i paid $ _num_ for an irish car bomb !
this place is ridiculous !
_num_ stars are not available .
the hype and size of this place is why it is getting _num_ stars .
if i want a pub feel , i will go to george & dragon .
past that no thank you .
overlooked fried food and the worst pint of guinness i have ever had .
horrible service and bartender seems to be an old trailer park manager .
walked in at around _num_ on a moderately busy friday night .
i 'm going to assume he did not wash his hands .
walked in on sunday .
first i checked yelp and saw 3-4 stars based on _num_ reviews .
she took one bite and said no .
it was drenched in a chicken gravy ala sick .
i ordered the egg foo young , with barbecue pork .
it was decent to average , nothing special .
not have it delivered to me already floating .
i 'm not really sure how this place has lasted _num_ years .
restaurants like this can not simply survive on this quality of food .
they have _num_ dinning rooms and while we visited about _num_ customers .
poor service , poor to mediocre food , poor atmosphere , _num_ star .
as well as being the only thing standing from the city 's historic chinatown .
the atmosphere from the start was dead wrong .
customer service was pretty much zero .
i love hole in the wall chinese food restaurants .
we ate saturday night , and used a restaurant dot com coupon .
ordered a ton of food , so tried lots of dishes .
the rest was terrible .
i mean , mystery meat .
i will never return .
wrong !
not a good place to come if you need a quick lunch .
after eating there , i wish i had n't bothered .
the dishes were terrible .
the `` spicy pineapple pork '' was neither spicy , nor had any pineapple .
it tasted of ketchup and vinegar with some pork .
the rice was terrible .
save your money and go to panda express instead .
the food is equally terrible , but they probably know that dessert is food .
there are plenty of other cheap ( and better ) options in the area .
i went today and it was definitely below average .
it was very drab and badly need of updating .
the waitress was nice but neglected to ask us what we wanted to drink .
annoying .
it would n't be enough to bring me back .
the servers do n't appreciate your business .
very frustrating experience .
we may have ordered the wrong things but what we tried was just so-so .
we ordered an egg roll and it too had an odd flavor .
was n't awful , but i 've had better at other restaurants .
my boyfriend had their mongolian beef and suffered the same thing .
maybe it was a freak incident , maybe not .
either way , i wo n't be going here again .
there 's plenty of other chinese food restaurants that deserve your appetite 's attention .
hell , even panda express is better than this garbage .
do n't waste your time .
i did n't wait long for my food .
maybe i will try the soup next time .
but the service was horrible !
service was mediocre , food was not great .
paid cash and change was not an option .
unfortunately it was overwhelmingly disappointing .
the only thing worse than the food there , is the service .
special fried rice is good but , again , tiny shrimp & meat pieces .
skip this place and to wong 's instead .
sing high does have a better looking dining room .
no refills on ice tea .
but no longer .
but it was almost 6pm and i had n't eaten all day .
the place is roomy , lots of parking and places to sit .
with a mystery flavorless white sauce drenched through out .
which was ridiculously over battered .
which still had a bit of sweet and sour sauce on it .
the sauce was probably the only redeeming factor food wise .
long story short , i ate a grilled cheese when i got home .
i take a bite and its awful and tastes sour .
here 's where things get ridiculous .
this is not one of them .
why did i return here ?
it was all so nasty and i know the dishes were n't properly washed .
i 'm never coming back here .
it 's been a long time since i 've eaten at sing high .
the server was initially going to sit me by a large group of people .
sing high is just not what i remembered .
very rude !
food was very bland and lemon chicken was like it was microwaved .
the bathroom was dirty and paper towels on the floor .
the walls were dirty and needed to be cleaned .
bad service all together .
the food that i had was the number _num_ and that was gross !
the noodles were under cooked and the shrimp was dripping with oil .
the rice was ok to eat because that was only one cooked .
i do n't really know if i will be back to this place !
if i could i would give half a star for this .
we stopped in on friday night before the baseball game .
what a huge disappointment .
service was so slow it almost did n't happen .
the shrimp with chinese peas and hong kong steak .
terrible .
over salted and lacked any other taste to it than that .
there were a lot of other families there but it was n't full .
very disappointing experience for this arizona landmark .
lousy food , poor service and got the bill wrong and argued about it .
i had been craving a good egg roll .
wow , what a disappointment .
the egg foo young was just ok .
the egg roll was the worst i ever had .
the man behind me sent his back .
i was short on time so i just left my money and walked out .
never to return again .
i sure do not know what has happened to the old establishment .
so i was not satisfied with their food .
it was disgusting !
took forever to get the nasty ass food .
then i could n't eat anything !
how do you mess up fried chicken wings ?
same nasty batter on them as well !
chicken tasted almost raw !
i refused to pay for any of my food !
so disappointed .
simply just avoid .
the cook ( s ) have zero pride in what they are serving .
zero .
well , they gave my credit card to someone else ?
the music was great however the bartender attitude was horrible !
she was rude to few people in party .
we had just let a different place and had no problems .
she has a horrible attitude !
she is impossible to talk to at the window .
do n't even bother asking for sauces .
she is awful .
bad attitude also .
because when you want fast food , an extra _num_ minutes is nothing .
this place puts the dick in ridiculous .
no apologies .
list goes on .
the only reason the place makes any money is the location .
i beg you corporate jack in the box shut this place down !
not good customer service .
living in phoenix you get used to how things are .
after a while , you decide to give up on it .
you decide that it really wo n't change .
try my florist once a year .
do n't order any food , and definitely do n't order any bread .
i also remember when i was little going to my florist for flowers .
but let me make my attempt .
what came back was a brown thing that looked like chocolate milk .
tell me , does sapphire sound like `` espresso '' to you ?
not to say that the bread is n't good .
not someplace i would choose to go to ever again .
a lot of money for beyond bland .
i would rather jack in the box down the street .
they 've got an oven , but they do n't have a stove .
bang on , nicole , bang on !
i hate hate hate valet parking .
i hate it so much .
i wo n't turn over my keys to them .
the servers are friendly enough but it 's always been slow in my experience .
this place could not last in any other major city .
the service can be appalling .
the food is basic and very expensive .
we went to my florist with four other people we met through yelp .
both the sandwiches and drinks were disappointing .
my husband 's roast beef sandwich was even worse , though .
the bread is the only good part of anything .
_num_ dollar peanut butter and jelly ?
are you kidding me ?
i 've been here about _num_ times total , and i am completely unimpressed .
the food is overpriced and just not worth it .
that 's bad .
i wo n't be back ever .
it 's a shame , too , because it is within walking distance .
the food is just ok , nothing special at all .
the veggie wrap was not the best i 've had by far .
i had this italian cream , and i tried the tiramisu .
our waiter seemed more scottsdale than downtown phoenix though .
overall , way overrated and over-priced .
the service was a little slow all around .
it was very awkward .
one thing i do not want to do is watch myself eat .
the service was completely awful .
they priced it like it was special though .
i hate things with hype and this is exactly why .
do n't bother .
the nachos are served on pieces of toasted baguette with melted cheese .
first , my grilled chicken was not `` grilled '' and it tasted odd .
but the deal breaker was the leaf salad that came with my sandwich .
just about all of us had the same salad with our wraps and sandwiches .
i went to the web site to check on pricing .
no happy hour specials ?
now i 'm downright pissed .
um , for five people at _num_ o'clock ?
no , of course not .
( sorry this is so long .
i went to my florist cafe with my family once before .
the waiter was nice , but the food was unremarkable and overpriced .
what kind of restaurant doesnt have child seats ?
i didnt stay for the food because they didnt have them .
this place sucks .
everything is overpriced and ridiculously underwhelming .
service was n't good the food not much better .
try putting cold butter over cold waffles not cool .
ugh ... this place is pretentious , it 's not even funny .
i used to think sandwiches at paradise bakery were kinda pricey .
the chicken salad is decent , but i have had so much better .
not a good thing .
the service here is downright terrible .
everything here is super slow .
in any event , i avoid this place .
this place just does n't feel very comfortable .
i get a very odd feeling when i am in the restaurant .
its bad in general .
the service is lame .
no taste , small _num_ dollars .
watered down drinks .
another _num_ minutes to get a menu .
another _num_ to order .
about _num_ to get simple breakfast food .
another _num_ minutes to receive said menu .
at that point , i can honestly say i did n't .
i think they just really need to take everything up a notch .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
first time ever i was asked to leave a restaurant ... .
bruschetta is poor and bread is n't toasted .
cheese platter is a bit sparse for $ _num_ .
that being said , my two star rating is more due to the environment .
the service is below par , way below par .
we sat down and were greeted fairly quickly and made our order .
the second server presented the bill and seemed to be the main one .
everything was hot and/or cold as appropriate .
the service was plain awful .
for pete 's sake , lady , show some professionalism .
thirty minutes from walking in the front door , we did not have food .
no such luck .
glasses sat empty .
the glasses were still empty despite refill promises from two different servers .
i had one of the worst dining experiences recently at my florist .
this is my pet peeve .
what a terrible experience .
wish these guys could get it right !
it feels like a big city restaurant inside .
well , once she stopped playing , all focus went back on the food .
lackluster service , and attitude from the host did n't help either .
at least that could have been prepared properly .
my florist should be the bomb .
my florist is all atmosphere and no substance .
why is n't this place better ?
lackluster , slow service .
i was not terribly impressed .
the last two times i 've ate here it was not good .
the most recent time the service was poor .
either way i do n't recommend this place .
pathetic !
this place is awful .
i will never take my daughter there again for school age day care .
bathrooms are filthy with urine all over the floor .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
this location , not so much .
for starters the manager was _num_ min late .
while i was waiting another parent buzzed me in .
i would urge anyone to avoid this business .
sorry , crazy jim .
however , the owners are soooooo unfriendly !
horrible service from the entire staff !
this gyro had meat , tomato and onion .
that is hardly how you make a gyro .
not to mention the tzatziki sauce was awful .
she told me soup , pasta salad , fries , and steamed veggies .
so i chose the fries .
she then told me the total was _num_ dollars and change .
she repeated the total .
she told me the pasta salad was on special .
horrible service , cold and tasteless food , and lastly no apology for either .
when we asked to see a manager , she responded she was the manager .
i believe in supporting local businesses but i 'm never going back .
the service was bad and the food was average .
save yourself the hassle and skip this place .
( blonde lady ) is so rude and so horrible to you .
when they delivered it , the price was $ _num_ !
salad was $ _num_ with $ _num_ delivery .
she was very rude .
after seeing other reviews , i 'm not surprised !
this place has always been very unfriendly but i tried to look past it .
this morning was the worst of it all and i will never go back !
i would never want someone else 's food that 's been touched !
i told her that was rude to say about me .
i told her she made no sense and that 's not my problem .
this whole time she was being completely rude to me and saying mean things .
the owner jim whose is her father said to give me my money back .
i gave her money back i do n't need her business !
i 've never been treated this way before .
i will never go back to this restaurant again !
their curry lentil is terrible !
it 's like curry chicken without the chicken or anything else , just liquid .
i called up and apparently it 's supposed to be like that .
i 'm sorry but that is not curry lentil .
i 'm not sure about now .
have n't ate in yet because their prices are ridiculous !
i 've had much better , nothing to write home about .
the chicken was over cooked , dry and extremely salty .
seems every time i call for a delivery they ca n't .
very disappointed with new management in this place .
this was the worst i 've ever had .
i ordered _num_ gyro platters and it came with just meat and soggy fries !
the food also has been terrible .
the burgers used to be good but now they 're disgusting .
strike _num_ on these folks !
no more , i am quite done .
this is my least favorite lunch stop i 've ever been to downtown .
then the rest of us have to suffer too .
very typical sandwiches like turkey , roast beef , etc , etc .
i might like the place better if i ate alot of red meat .
the toppings are very pedestrian and limited .
i was disappointed .
we had to wait a long time for our veggie sandwiches .
it 's supposed to have swiss , provolone and american cheese on it .
traffic jam = a wreck .
same thing .
)
worst latte that i have ever had .
no foam , all milk .
gross .
the worst sandwich i have ever had in my life .
and i thought it was pretty difficult to make a bad sandwich .
i wish i would of just save a few dollars and gone to subway .
wrong .
nothing memorable , and will not miss this place much .
it was during the lunch hour , but they were not terribly busy .
the meal itself was marginal at best .
also , their bathroom was an absolute mess .
eh -- no .
the place did n't seem very clean either .
just not a good experience .
the sushi was grocery store quality and cold .
if everything cost two dollars less , complaints could be overlooked .
a bunch of rice with no seasoning and a tasteless salad .
and the place smells like sewage ... .
however , they always forget the soy sauce .
this has happened roughly _num_ times .
i found this to be very rude and totally out of line .
what is _num_ % _num_ % of $ _num_ ?
this place is awful .
if i wanted cup of noodles for lunch , i could make it myself .
instant noodles are not fresh .
noodle soups should not be accompanied by rice .
needless to say , i barely slept .
instead , we stayed in two rooms that each had one bed .
i 'm not sure if the issue lies with hotels.com or with budget downtown .
it works as long as you are n't expecting more .
can you give the production _num_ 1/2 stars and give the play _num_ ?
and unfortunately , the experience requires both to be good .
lighting and sound were spot on .
_num_ calls later and nothing .
this is no way of doing business , especially for loyal patrons .
disappointed .
why would these clothes be art ?
no clue there .
the only really good thing about the phoenix art museum are their grounds .
unfortunately , i felt extremely uncomfortable during my stay .
this was , unfortunately , a disappointment .
i did also find the asian art section small and disappointing .
i think i spent most of my time looking at his work .
terrible experience with my almost _num_ year old .
strike _num_ .
we went to the kids area which was really small and boring for him .
we fell in love with the museum and booked our wedding there .
no really .
o m g !
facebook for tv is what the morning show is .
i am a big fan of fox _num_ up to this point .
no one ever got back to me .
the gym downstairs is crowded and messy .
i feel sad about this ; this was `` my y '' for years .
i also feel sad as i love to support the y .
but this particular one is not up to standard .
mmmm ... maybe the y does n't want me anymore .
no more cafe .
replacing equipment with crap no one uses .
that , in and of itself , was a nightmare .
he replied , `` i do n't use fans in my class . ''
had an extremely rude interaction with a young girl who worked behind the desk .
the worst y i have ever been to .
men 's locker and showers are disgusting .
no respect or courtesy in the sauna or steam areas .
the list goes on and on .
treated my family like shit .
do not use him he is the worst .
and a asshole .
treated my family like shit .
do not use him he is the worst .
in fact , it was placed on the chair inside the window .
so i will try mail it elsewhere next time .
nothing i was after .
i really like this place .
i 'm not easily offended .
i am not sure where to start .
all and all 1st half was eh 2-3 out of _num_ .
it was so slow and boring ... .
it was just bad .
it was boring .
extremely painful !
ugh ... where to begin ... this was such a waste of time .
i am glad it was only $ _num_ .
i felt like apologizing to everyone afterward because the entire show was so disappointing .
ok ... just not funny .
better writing .
i am extremely disappointed .
the place seemed a little cleaner than last time we were there .
when it was _num_ they got all excited , but nothing .
_num_ minutes went by and nothing .
the staff is extremely rude .
the blonde older lady was nasty to us and our kids .
just old props and singing .
my kids were disappointed .
save your money ppl and catch a movie .
however , the staff is completely rude .
the seating was extremely uncomfortable .
i was mortified to hear that no flowers were delivered .
i learned my lesson not to use budget .
however , they certainly did n't have to charge me .
the vehicle received was a kia soul .
an absolute nightmare !
one of the worst rental car experiences ever !
we went to sedona on our honeymoon and rented a car from phoenix .
she basically made him feel like he could not leave without buying that insurance .
i 'm sorry ?
she would not refund my money or give me credit towards a future rental .
the actual car was fine but everything else was the worst ever !
horrid ... horrid ... horrid .
i showed up , line was n't too long , everything was good !
at this point i was completely shocked that i was scammed like this .
truly disgusting business practices .
customer service was terrible .
plus the car was dirty and smelled like it had n't ever been cleaned .
will never rent from budget again .
_num_ min wait for a pre paid car !
avoid at all cost .
worst excuse for customer service i have ever experienced .
but they were kind enough to offer me an upgrade .
budget should be called low budget and they are dead to me .
worst ever !
do yourself a favor and rent your car elsewhere .
over _num_ hour wait .
probably worst car rental experience ever .
absolute worst car company !
never going back if you want a good rental go through dollar !
later i tried to call the customer service to have charges removed .
they refused .
turns out , despite my clear understanding , i was charged for the upgrade .
what i was really signing was the upgrade charges .
is n't that supposed to be one of the busiest travel times ?
had we not prepaid , we would have gone to another company .
this location lost our car after we returned it .
then , the steering wheel had grease on it .
turned out the spare time and tools were loose in the trunk .
i have used this hertz rental agency twice now .
the second time , i was unable to rent a car .
whatever you do , please avoid renting from this hertz location !
take caution on renting from hertz .
why are they soooooo slow ?
no line .
this the comments i left with hertz .
the car was ok a bit dirty but ok .
no thanks !
an awful experience .
there has been no return call since my first message one week ago .
waited in line for _num_ hours ... horrible .
if i could score less than a star i would .
it was not so much the location as the company that has so horrible .
we had been renting as our car was in the shop .
when it was finally my turn , i asked if there were any upgrades .
car was fine .
no complaints there .
just the customer service sucked .
worst counter service i 've ever had ... anywhere and for anything .
i rented a luxury car _num_ months ahead of time .
i wish i took the names so i could put them on here .
my bill for that was around _num_ dollars .
usually insurance is about _num_ to _num_ dollars per day .
but no insurance amount was not explained to me .
not a person , a box .
once i did get up the to counter it was ok service .
definitely not my best experience renting a car .
i probably waited in the main line for about _num_ minutes .
it seemed like everyone ahead of me never rented a car before .
useless !
anyways , i get downstairs and i have to wait another 15-20 minutes .
the car that i was assigned to was all scratched up .
while i had the car , i noticed multiple problems with the car .
i probably would n't rent from hertz again .
it took way too long to get in and out of there .
i was one among 5-6 parties waiting to turn over our rentals .
i 'm pretty sure i would n't rent from hertz again .
one of the things i looked forward to growing up was turning _num_ .
as a tip , always check the internet for coupon codes .
but my most recent rental was quite the ordeal .
this is by far the worst run hertz i 've dealt with .
never leave without a receipt .
even then the service can be poor .
one hour wait in line to rent a freakin ' car .
you 're wasting my time .
bye bye , hertz .
wo n't be renting from you again .
a few days later we got a flat tire .
oh well i still saved _num_ % .
whatever you do , avoid hertz at all cost at this airport .
since , _num_ , i 've probably flown into phoenix _num_ or _num_ times .
if this were an isolated incident in phoenix , i could understand .
ridiculous .
now that 's some really incompetent target marketing if i 've ever seen any .
i travel a lot , experienced a lot of rental car facilities .
car had tire low air light on when i picked it up .
car was also dirty .
- on return _num_ people waiting for one person to print bills .
i left and was charged for gas which the car was full , .
this location is terrible .
what a disaster .
waste of my time .
more bad planning from the corporation becomes my problem .
omg , really ?
still have not returned my cc deposit $ _num_ after _num_ days !
avoid hertz if you are trying to speak to a human !
i am not going to be renting from hertz again .
customer service rep was also rude to my wife .
i am also not the only one .
too little , too late i am afraid .
woman next to me is livid too .
not good hertz .
this hertz is the worst car rental place at phx airport .
wrong !
not washed .
i realize you probably have more cars going out then coming in .
i 'll never rent from hertz again .
hertz is generally not the cheapest .
in phoenix , i am almost always disappointed .
i am very dissappointed with hertz .
i have been a gold choice member for many years .
i 'm very dissappointed in the customer service and lack of communication on hertz .
unfortunately , my company makes me use hertz for business travel .
the phoenix airport experience is horrendous .
i wo n't put up with it anymore .
had the worse experience .
ruined our 1st day of our short vacation .
i will never use hertz again .
took longer to rent my car than fly here .
absolutely ridiculous .
really bad !
the workers ca n't do simple addition .
hertz , you are very sneaky and dishonest !
me : no thank you .
when you treat customers like this , they will not return .
why bother making reservations when they do n't have enough cars !
worst rental car experience we 've ever had .
no explanation or compensation for the wait was offered .
dropping off our car was even worse .
we get it , delays and account problems happen .
this is the 2nd time i have waited over _num_ hr for our car .
we are even gold members and paid extra to have the car ready quicker .
ridiculous !
terrible .
worst experience with a rental car to date .
left a message with the phoenix agency itself that was never returned .
poor customer service and unethical employees .
_num_ hour wait and had no clue what they sold me .
every seemed lost .
strike # _num_ unacceptable .
hertz is so unprofessional and does not handle it 's business practices correctly .
i am not paying for the gas that i was promised would be free .
i want this resolved immediately .
worst car rental experience in my life .
fortunately where we were going in arizona was pretty flat .
we ended up paying over $ _num_ is gas at about $ _num_ gallon .
Neutral
if there were a way to give negative stars , i would .
so , i called the rental agency and talked with the manager on duty .
she promised to look into it and call me back within _num_ hours .
not so .
a month later , the gas charge is still on my card .
if you choose to , be very careful about the charges .
the guy in the counter asked me if i would need rental coverage .
he finished the paperwork and asked my signature for rental form .
i have never experienced anything like this with any rental companies .
i 'd never rent from hertz again !
worst car rental experience ever !
they made us wait over two hours for our car .
i will never rent from hertz again !
i am now renting from budget and others .
i will never rent from hertz again !
hertz rental is quite possibly the worst rental agency ever .
talk about unorganized and slow .
not at this hertz .
cheap rental ?
over _num_ people waiting and more were coming behind me .
ugh .
the agent is out of the mid size vehicle i requested .
heck no !
another _num_ minutes of my life i ca n't get back .
after the nightmare i experienced at check in i decided to wait .
he wrote down the miles and gas and escorted me to a manager .
will never rent from hertz at the location again !
i was _num_ minutes late to my appointment .
terrible !
but not if you 're renting from hertz .
poor performance hertz .
i am very disappointed .
terrible service .
he did n't even care to look at his vehicles .
i 'm a loyal hertz customer and rent about a dozen cars per year .
lines to exit are jammed and long .
_num_ min just to exit the rental car lot .
very , very lame .
my bill was overcharged .
does not make sense to rent with hertz very frustrating experience .
lame policies .
she did n't tell me that when she `` recommended '' it to me .
when i was finally 6th in line , it took an additional _num_ minutes .
when i returned the car , i had fee upon fee upon fee .
i have called this branch _num_ times .
_num_ .
i will never rent from hertz again .
their customer service sucks and they rip you off .
never again will i book hertz at phx ... _num_ times in _num_ weeks .
received worst service from the customer service rep in hertz gold office .
my name was n't on the board , and she acted so rude .
this place sucks .
took a full bus to the rental area ( _num_ min ride ) .
wo n't rent here again .
no car , no explanation or why .
hertz is horrible at this location .
_num_ people waiting no one checking in cars .
after waiting _num_ minutes i got disgusted and left .
worst rental car experience ever !
arrived to a line of _num_ plus people .
decided to use the video chat kiosk instead - probably the worse decision .
was put on a wait list for an hour .
waited in line to get out of parking structure for _num_ mins .
left messages and no returned calls .
still sitting here with a $ _num_ gas bill that is still not resolved .
very poor service .
hertz just lost a loyal customer !
hyundai , did i say upgrade and hyundai in the same sentence ... yup .
was traveling with a coworker otherwise could have skipped the line .
took us nearly _num_ minutes and there was only _num_ other people in line .
avoid hertz at all costs and go to enterprise .
you will avoid a huge headache by doing so .
terrible service .
the wait was ridiculous .
service was awful .
paid too much for a tiny car .
we left a message no call back .
there was a empty bottle of wine underneath the passengers seat !
terrible !
since when did renting a car feel like losing a kidney !
well , it 's all crap .
there were _num_ employees working with customers .
it took me almost _num_ minutes to be seen by someone .
you 're wasting my time !
there was zero customer service .
not worth it .
considering it was already returned , i do n't know what 's worse .
there is literally over _num_ computers at the hertz desk .
she told another guy to walk over and do it .
after asking at the very end `` so no apology what so ever ?
i just rented with hertz in phoenix .
aside from being dangerous and inconvenient it did not work well .
i recently rented through hertz using aaa .
when i signed my agreement the total balance was $ _num_ not $ _num_ .
i will never rent from hertz again .
wo n't rent from them again .
he handed me the receipt and i went to go get the car .
my bad as i should have checked the receipt before i left .
this is my second time renting from hertz .
two bad car rental experiences with hertz and i 'm done .
i rent a car with the check engine light on .
i learn later there is no gas cap .
car fails on the freeway .
i call the _num_ number ... and wait ... and wait .
it goes to the _num_ number .
`` customer service '' counter is open but not staffed .
walk across the garage to the gold desk .
thanks for nothing .
if i could give this business zero stars i would .
first , i called early sunday morning to make a reservation for that afternoon .
finally about _num_ minutes later we leave in a _num_ ford focus .
horrible customer service !
are you kidding me ?
they do not honor reservations at the time you reserve the car for !
do not rent here .
my experience with my car rental was not a good one .
i went to the counter and completed the transaction with the clerk .
i had a meeting within an hour and was quite frustrated .
i could n't believe what i saw .
as of this writing i have not heard back from hertz .
this is the worst company in phoenix .
use anyone but hertz because they will _num_ % try to steal your money .
horrible service .
we had to wait over _num_ mins to get checked out .
omg unbelievably rude and unprofessional clerk working at hertz in phoenix airport .
no refund yet ... so i will never rent again from hertz .
even _num_ star is to much for this location .
avoid this business at all costs .
first , it takes them forever to process customers .
absolutely do not rent from this company .
the one star given is too generous of a score i must add .
beyond frustrating .
no email response from private message sent _num_ days ago .
run , do n't walk , away from this company !
every employee here would be fired at any other hertz location .
think twice before choosing this location and company .
only two agents at the desk with over _num_ customers waiting .
only one person at the car checkout .
waited more than _num_ hours .
not much else to do so why not yelp about it .
i did not get a single person to answer or call me back .
do not use this location .
i paid _num_ for a _num_ hour rental and a lost license .
needless to say , we 're going back to enterprise for our rental needs .
my husband was checking our credit card statement and realized we were charged more .
do not rent here .
i rented through a third party and was treated like crap because of it .
i was blatantly lied to and never told about any upgrade .
however , since the rental conditions changed , the rate changed as well .
ashley o . ''
i rent cars for business nearly every week in various cities throughout the us .
the line was not too long but from here the customer experience went downhill .
_num_ .
_num_ .
in _num_ years of rentals this has never happened ... .
_num_ staff .
i could have walked to my destination before getting this rental car .
at no time did we upgrade our vehicle or request to upgrade our vehicle .
thats $ _num_ for a one week rental !
car would not start .
Neutral
not surprised by the other negative reviews .
i rented a car from this hertz last weekend .
then i was charged fees for bringing the car back dirty .
Neutral
if i could give negative stars i would .
their customer service is nonexistent .
the place is unorganized , slow , and utterly horrible .
finally they offered to remove half , but not the full amount .
really sad .
my experience was terrible .
everything about the experience is horrible and slow .
next time , i 'm just getting a cab .
service was terrible .
staff was rude and unorganized .
i would never rent through hertz again !
horrible !
no other rental company has a wait ... why try harder ?
if hertz wants more stars , try treating customers better .
this hertz i had a bad experience getting out .
hey hertz - - - open another exit lane !
why ?
at this point , i 'm not too happy .
not good times there .
returning it was smooth , too .
probably will have to call them if that does n't happen soon .
this is the worst place i had ever rented a car .
my $ _num_ estimate including taxes turned into $ _num_ .
i will never rent from hertz again .
i will never rent from hertz again , sadly .
read your documents carefully and learn from my mistake .
do not rent from this place .
hertz in general is a joke actually .
i will never rent from hertz again .
th is place does n't answer the phone whatsoever .
sorry i 'm not sorry , but i will not private message you .
you can not do anything for me .
this past trip i rented from avis , and they were awesome .
i was in and out in less than _num_ minutes .
Negative
if only we could give zero stars , we would .
worst rental car experience we 've ever had .
we barely had room for our luggage .
we have done business with hotwire before and we have rented numerous vehicles before .
then she said , `` oh , no .
it has no trunk and no back seat .
no trunk ?
no back seat ?
wrong .
this was $ _num_ extra .
she said , `` i have no idea .
i 've contacted priceline and they 're looking into it , supposedly .
i suggest you avoid hertz at all costs .
the nightmare continues .
extremely long wait time .
unfortunately we purchased online ( do n't recommend this ) .
i wish we could leave less than one star .
dropping off seemed easy my husband filled out the express paperwork and left car .
i ca n't even believe this happened .
_num_ am ?
i ignored the bad reviews thinking i 'm sure we 'd be fine .
anyone they try to scam call your credit card company .
i do n't see how this is legal of them .
we did n't return the car at _num_ am !
there is no way to contact this hertz location via phone .
i called multiple times , no one picked up the phone .
i left _num_ voice messages , no one ever called back .
still no response .
even then they did not have car reserved .
very disappointing .
i said no but here is what he looked like .
i immediately contacted the hertz corporate office and they would not help me .
inconsistent experiences .
first time , not too bad .
name was n't on marquee so had to wait in line .
car seemed `` cheap '' but it was very affordable price .
it was n't and they gave my car away .
drop off has never been an issue though , thankfully .
this is annoying and takes extra time .
customers should realize where they stand with hertz - nowhere .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
unfortunately , yelp requires at least one star .
worst car rental ever !
wish i could give `` _num_ '' stars !
new to gold which came with my marriott elite membership .
i hated everything about this .
hated that .
but i wo n't stop in the phoenix hertz counter area .
and the car does n't have any power .
i would have appreciated it and been much more likely to come back .
when is bad service considered fraud ?
on a trip to arizona , be my guest !
it was up nearly $ _num_ dollars and i did n't purchase insurance !
why do i have a facility fee of $ _num_ a day !
i purchased a full tank in advance .
the clerk told me their gas was less expensive so i fell for it .
the car had a _num_ gallon tank .
and tax ... _num_ % .
so hertz , why not just call it what it is ?
$ _num_ is n't a bad rate .
hertz never apologized and it took over a week to get my refund .
the manager also never returned my calls or message at the location .
the customer service agents were terrible .
idiots .
horrible company !
terrible service , horrible cars !
may seem cheaper at first glance but they rip you off .
had a flat and car was not inspected upon leaving from pickup location .
long lines , horrible service , terrible cars !
bad customer service ?
i cant imagine what that would have cost me .
horrible business practices !
would n't give us an available car at the same price .
# _num_ gold club member with a reservation ?
too bad , they ran out of cars .
twice this has happened to me at the phoenix hertz location .
shame on me for giving them a second try .
this hertz installation is one of the worst run in the system .
as someone else said , avoid hertz at the phoenix airport .
they tried and tried and tried to sell me more .
i almost walked away .
my sick mother gets dropped off at hertz yesterday afternoon to get a rental .
they charged an additional $ _num_ for fuel ... wait what ?
i was the 21st person in line and they only have _num_ clerks .
it is midnight where i flew from and i am tired .
terrible customer service !
never ever use hertz ... national rental was awesome !
the airport location does not answer their phone .
i will be renting from avis in the future .
hertz will likely not be helpful .
the reservation she walked in with gave the total estimated charge as $ _num_ .
it follows that my balance should be approximately $ _num_ .
i do not have the name of the agent who handled my initial booking .
i arrived at phx around 6:30 p.m. friday .
moreover , hertz tried to add a $ _num_ charge to my credit card .
you got me once hertz , for less than _num_ dollars .
this location is very poorly managed .
trying to fix this was more work than should be necessary .
honestly this place is a big disappointment .
i just do n't even know how i feel .
totally understaffed with only three people working and really slow .
disgrace .
worst customer service experience i have ever had .
i immediately called hertz saying i did not agree to any upgrade .
$ _num_ is a lot to scam out of someone .
if i could give them less than one star i would .
he was the most unpleasant man i have encountered in a long time .
horrible customer service .
worst experience ever .
i 'm _num_ hours from the airport and they could n't care less .
awful customer service , they are scam .
i booked a car through hotwire and paid $ _num_ .
the branch manager was n't helpful either .
worst rental company i have ever dealt with .
we called that number _num_ times and no help was avail .
we are very unhappy at the wait and service .
if i could give _num_ star 's that would be awesome !
i purchased my rental on priceline .
my credit card was charged $ _num_ dollars .
never rent here , even if it seems like a good deal .
because those fees add up and your better off renting somewhere else .
i was a gold member until i visited this location .
i reserved a car using hotwire a few weeks ago for pickup at phx .
not his fault .
what kind of scam are you running at hertz .
does it not sound ridiculous ?
deceptive sales practice !
no biggie , but new to me .
not staffed appropriately leading to lines that take an hour to get your car .
do not waste your time .
skip it .
plan for _num_ minutes waiting for shuttle .
_num_ minutes in line at counter .
the staff at the counter was kind but overworked .
they have lost this customer .
my worst rental car experience bar none .
obviously hertz has no clue when it comes to customer service .
you should upgrade '' it was a nightmare .
hertz is the absolute bottom of the barrel .
hertz would not rent me a car !
no problem , my reservation is the next day .
he can not find my reservation .
as i stated , i am a local resident .
something is seriously wrong with this place .
there were probably _num_ people in line and _num_ person at the counter .
many folks were calling the corporate office to complain .
i asked the employee if this was normal and he said no .
was n't really an answer to my question , but whatever .
i declined this absurd rate .
bottom line , terribly staffed and trained employees .
longer line , standing in line for an hour so far .
and not one other car rental agency has lines .
and i can guarantee i will use neither priceline or hertz again .
horrible !
we will never use hertz at this airport again .
there are plenty of rental options at sky harbor .
very shady practices going on here .
like other posters , they could not find my reservation .
i ask if my prepaid reservation covers that and she says , no .
there would be an upgrade fee .
she then asks if i want insurance .
shame on you hertz .
there were approximately _num_ customers in line .
if i didnt already have a reservation i would have looked elsewhere .
Negative
i would give this zero or negative stars .
three hour wait to get your car .
by far this is the worst customer service ever seen .
people are not getting the car that they prepaid .
i will never ever use hertz again .
it took us longer to rent our car than to fly here .
very shady additional fees slipped in to my charges .
they seemed to simply not care .
no one is watching the shop , or they just do n't care !
lines are horrible .
_num_ minute wait .
all the other rental companies had no waiting lines .
started out at just $ _num_ more -- we said no .
then low and behold they had another car for $ _num_ more .
they know you have been waiting long and are tired .
they will try and wear you down .
we should have stuck to our guns and gone for the one we booked .
avoid this location at all costs as many others have said .
very shady practices going on here .
make sure you have plenty of time to wait for your reserved car .
stay away from this location and probably all hertz rental locations !
it 's like the go out of their way to make it hard .
the service level here is very poor .
horrible , horrible service .
very very long line .
the lot attendants will refuse to even acknowledge you .
terrible ... terrible experience .
i rented the car through priceline .
avoid hertz they are not worth the hassle !
what a nightmare !
i rented a car from april 20th through april 25th .
it was embarrassing , because i came to phx for an interview .
hertz hurts !
they just do n't care .
once there the wait to talk to representative was well over an hour .
i would not be surprised if this is the way it always is .
turns out the reservation was through expedia .
the entire process took _num_ hours !
we were do unhappy with experience we called and asked for some compensation .
the whole process really was very irritating .
really bizarre .
that would be so much less aggravation .
kiosk is not better than live employees .
it 's my problem .
awful experience .
tried to charge me more than i was quoted .
the car had trash in it and was dirty .
horrible experience .
Positive
i wish i could give this negative stars .
is n't that your entire business model ?
do n't waste your time .
however , i believe it should have been free .
every other rental place has 3-5 agents helping .
if you 're my worst enemy , feel free to use hurts .
hertz , hurry up and go belly up .
significant changes in management needed .
very poorly run operation .
big mistake !
i am a hertz gold five star member .
i rent with hertz at least _num_ times a month .
big mistake !
there was no loyalty to me .
i am in my second one hour line just trying to get a car .
could n't be any worse than hertz at this point !
terrible customer service , terrible management , warn out cars .
just avoid this place .
such a waste .
no guacamole , no pico , or anything else .
just some carne asada and lettuce on sticky , wet tortillas .
and how can any server just come up with a gratuity of _num_ % ?
my friend said that the chips were awesome .
she did n't like it very much .
service was terrible .
took _num_ minutes to get a watered down ice tea , with no ice .
guess i am going against the grain regarding the other reviews .
fried within an inch of its life and not very tasty .
having said that , their lasagna is tolerable .
tacky .
it was about _num_ in the afternoon and no other customers were around .
they did n't have items in my size and had no alternatives to suggest .
they definitely do n't even deserve _num_ star .
the things she told my daughter was not professional at all .
which was also a big mistake .
the manager was not even trying to hear my side of the story .
she was very rude as well .
you will not get the best of customer service .
i suggest going to party city , walmart , target , etc .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
she was rude , saying that she would n't take anything else .
and yes , the customer service is terrible .
that 's it !
get your vehicles off my property ! ''
totally , utterly , absolutely unnecessary !
get off my property !
i wish i could not leave a star at all .
terrible experience !
i will never return again .
i did not know their policy which is why i called .
the girl said that i was rude !
i should have ordered it online myself but now it 's too late .
the delivery never came ; apparently is was taken to the wrong home .
it was bizarre .
that she was rude and unprofessional is an understatement .
i have never been so badly treated .
i 'm tired of getting my hopes up and getting nothing .
that makes being on hold even worse than it already is .
three caps came lose .
on the third i stopped going back .
this was the worst dental experience of my life .
horrible dentist .
plus the facility itself was dirty .
gross !
i am sure i 'll have to get it redone somewhere else .
_num_ person on counter helping someone with directions .
my mistake was i asked for directions to a hotel close by .
( hotel is _num_ minutes away from airport exit ) .
except the car is in good sharp , there is no customer service .
speak with horrible tone and rude .
avoid avis , hertz gave me much better experiences .
service was mediocre .
no one .
terrible car selection and they all have high mileage .
i would stay away from here .
they had maybe _num_ workers at the counters .
they do n't inspect the car before you take it .
she was very rude and short .
great car rental but overall horrible customer experience .
they `` forgot to mention the almost _num_ % tax rate .
i called immediately and the explained me there was no upgrade .
as gold member it was super disappointing .
busy time of year but they only have _num_ clerks .
ugh .
rental car time ... one hour total .
my recent experience with avis however is the cause for the lower rating .
i was going to give _num_ stars .
also the steering wheel was extremely sticky and was pretty gross .
the vehicles were very basic .
the lady who helped me was so painfully slow .
absolutely would not use again .
we were tired after a long flight .
we were told that preferred customers could go to the front of the line .
i really only had good things to say until i got the final bill .
hopefully , it 's limited to this particular location .
the worst car rental experience of my life .
if i could select no stars , i would .
my rental experience was fine , no issues , or so i thought .
i do n't even own a pet .
i called customer service and explained , to no avail .
it 's absolutely ridiculous .
i advise all my employees to do the same .
this is what happens when management becomes blind to what makes a business successful .
i will never use avis or budget ( same company ) again .
not exactly a professional job .
worse experience ever !
the stylist said he was the owner , will not be coming back .
he used the razor to cut `` layers '' and they turned out horrible .
i will never go here again , and wish i would n't have .
the next day however , i find that my hair was uneven .
i feel like i paid $ _num_ for a $ _num_ haircut .
i had a bridesmaid 's dress altered here and was very disappointed .
despite _num_ attempts to get this point across , the alteration was never made .
but beyond that issue , the hem was done terribly .
i am not a regular when it comes to dry cleaning .
this place is overpriced anyway , and the people are rude .
too many other choices .
it 's seriously so over the top it 's ridiculous .
i 'm taking my business elsewhere .
kind of a lame dry cleaner .
echo the comments of others on the complete lack of customer service .
no surprise , but they refused to refund the `` rush fee . ''
the staff is rude and the ambiance is tacky .
this place sucks .
but i reserve it in case of emergency only .
but it filled the hole .
they also just started this second counter inside the deli called the inner grill .
grilled sandwiches , smaller portions and cheaper prices .
not so much .
horrible .
rude service , little to no options for vegetarians , overpriced for portion size .
rock hard flavorless tomatoes , etc .
my egg salad had shells in it .
this place is weak !
this place is horrible .
i paid over _num_ dollars for a so called brisket sandwich and a drink .
the service was completely rude .
i really do n't understand how this place stays in business .
never very go their for lunch .
the service was horrible and the food was atrocious .
it was worse than bar food .
i could n't even finish my sandwich .
do n't get the blt .
this place is over priced for the quality of food you get .
this place honestly should n't even call themselves a deli .
`` does the sandwich come with fries '' the food server said yes .
i get up to the cash register and she charges me for them .
i guess they need to listening skills as well .
overpriced cafeteria food .
but hey , if they screw up your order they give you free cookies .
the bread is aweful , very processed meat and tasteless recipe .
customer service is non existent .
does not follow up or make things right .
completely disappointing .
extremely bad customer service .
i looked in the bag just to make sure everything was in place .
bad customer service right there and they definitely lost my respect !
do not trust them because they do not want to help you at all !
southwest stranded me _num_ miles from my ( at that time ) home .
later , after flying home on another airline , i checked southwest 's website .
normally , i would give southwest a five .
she looked me directly in the eye and kept walking .
once again , the attendant skipped over my row .
for the first time ever , i pressed the flight attendant button .
flew southwest airlines two times before between phoenix and lax and once to austin .
two trips ago they badly damaged our luggage .
i am an a list preferred member with southwest airlines .
over the last _num_ months their service has become horrible .
really kind of sad how far they 've fallen .
this one is pathetic .
crowded smelly terminal and old planes .
yikes what a disaster .
poor customer service .
now on hold for _num_ minutes .
the wifi ( $ _num_ ) is terrible .
_num_ he 's stuck on a cramped plain with nothing to watch .
o and the `` dish tv for free '' .
so i asked the lady at the luggage counter when my bag would arrive .
she said it would be on the next plane in about _num_ hrs .
went to the desk , no luggage .
i do n't understand how that can happen .
not _num_ but _num_ flights , and my bag still mia .
i just lost _num_ to southwest 's insane policy .
the head flight knows i am thirsty and she is not bringing my drinks .
i had asked kindly for water at the they over and she did nothing .
used to be my favorite airline .
united is thinking of adding _num_ seats per plane ?
i just posted this to southwest 's facebook wall .
when i called customer service they said there is nothing they can do .
this is literally $ _num_ - not a large amount .
is it a lack of employees ?
i 'm so glad i was early .
my loyalty to southwest is constantly being tested .
i only wish that was true .
free bags just not worth being treated like a criminal .
it 's not a bargain anymore .
on time performance terrible .
no bad weather anywhere .
no explanation either .
always a bad ending to a long day of travel .
will be closing my account and looking for a new favorite airline .
cattle run gone bad .
worst $ _num_ i ever saved .
southwest airlines is out of style .
_num_ is over .
when they are bad - they are terrible .
when they are good , they are n't as good as they think .
their system made a mistake - not the traveler .
shame on you .
i was quickly informed i would n't make my denver ( den ) departure .
no go !
sadly , this was the tip of the iceberg .
in addition , there 's no assigned seating for the extra cost .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
southwest does n't know the meaning of customer service !
which is it and why ca n't we get a straight story ?
no explanation , no compensation , no communication .
the flight is n't free so someone needs to accept responsibility for the issue ?
why would anyone fly with this airline .
been in line for _num_ min and still standing .
i sure miss us airways .
southwest airlines used to be the only airline i would fly ... .
but over the years they have become a total joke .
additionally , figure out your boarding system .
use your brain and not your policies when dealing with passengers .
has n't been real fun .
see ya later , you circus of an airline !
not this trip .
no offer for a later direct flight out of denver .
why ca n't i get my tsa pre number on my boarding pass ?
their delays are the worst .
somewhat cheap flights but not worth it when getting last minute flights .
i like that you get two free checkin bags , which is a plus .
i do n't normally write reviews but i 'm horribly dissapointed in southwest airlines .
i had surgery this week and im flying home and have a doctor appt .
are you kidding me ?
it 's ridiculous .
maintenance is predictable .
the customer service rep alice at the phoenix airport is horrible with handling customers .
she 's rude and looks to argue for no reason .
i asked if there was someone to assist her and she became more hostile .
i felt like a criminal and i did nothing wrong .
she was the worse person i experienced after _num_ flights and _num_ airports .
her tone was aggressive and she was extremely sarcastic .
i ca n't believe she 's in charge of anything with her attitude .
maybe she should clean the toilets being that she clearly can not handle customers .
i am so disappointed with her poor attitude .
my flight had _num_ empty seats .
this is my second time flying out of phx on southwest airlines .
the first time was last week , which was n't too bad .
well , like i said , last week was n't too bad .
the absolute worst !
fyi , i live at the airport here in phoenix now .
i think i 'm just super annoyed , because they said thirty minutes .
no one around me looks happy .
my phone is dying .
taxes for a flight i did n't board ?
i even confirmed with rep over the phone .
it was very busy at that counter .
i was confused as to why i was told something different .
i have never had such a horrible experience traveling .
i contacted the customer care .
unacceptable !
i purchased a round trip ticket and went to dc to visit family .
so disappointing but their terms are their terms i suppose .
something wrong with this picture .
i should leave a _num_ year old by herself ?
i flew over _num_ flights with southwest last year .
maybe next year i should go with another airline .
my experience here was great ... until about _num_ minutes after i ate .
it might be awhile before i can stomach any fried chicken again .
this is my first experience with chicken and waffles .
a bit too weird for me .
or ihop ?
i was really disappointed .
the coating on the fried okra was hard .
i was sooooo disappointed with this one .
the cake did n't have flavor , just red .
i grew up on southern food and this place was not tasty at all .
the service was friendly , but slow .
the chicken was dry and it was lacking on taste .
fried chicken was good , but everything else was a joke .
the service was unbelievably bad .
wife 's plate was just as bad .
our original waitress never bothered to check on us until she brought the bill .
the scrambled eggs were real , not the fake crap .
i just wish someone in the back new how to cook them properly .
very disappointing considering all the good reviews .
i do n't care if the chicken is good .
it 's not worth the wait .
stopped in at lo-lo 's after disney on ice about a week ago .
took another _num_ minutes to get our drinks .
chicken and waffles do not belong together .
why is the kool-aid flavored red ?
i had so much trouble finding it .
lo los chicken n waffles .
there goes the ambiance .
actual restaurant : too small and cramped .
very mediocre looking .
would n't say friendly .
the chicken was very salty .
salt does not equal flavor .
that 's a cheap way to make it creamy .
_num_ bites and i was done .
they also do not have ac inside this place .
i ate here in _num_ degree weather and it literally destroyed my meal .
all i did was down fruit punch .
i could n't enjoy my chicken and waffles .
the chicken was mediocre .
i would offer some other restaurant choices , if asked .
but , the issue i had today was the service .
we ate and chatted .
to boot the food was n't that good either .
but do n't expect much in the service department .
also what kind of breakfast places does n't open until 9am ?
do n't most of us need to get to work by then ?
this place is not all the hype !
chicken was a little greasy .
sides were bland .
it was just ok .
the mac and cheese was bland , the yams were decent .
the fried chicken is hit or miss .
once my chicken was finger looking good ; but then it tasted reheated .
i do n't see why everyone is raving about this place .
i think this place is just overrated and i would not be back again .
_num_ minutes goes by , no drinks .
_num_ more minutes go by .
our waitress completely ignored our table and section the whole time we waited .
there were not even drink refills in that _num_ hour wait .
_num_ minutes later the manager comes to our table with food !
ummmm no ... how about bringing the pregnant lady her food , eh ?
we were pretty disappointed in how the staff handled themselves .
not cool lolo 's , not cool at all .
sorry lo lo 's but the truth needs to be told .
well , _num_ minutes goes by and i check in with the hostess desk .
_num_ minutes later we were finally sitting down .
it took _num_ minutes to get our drinks .
it took an additional _num_ minutes to get our meals .
our server did n't make us feel welcomed .
the chicken was ok but only for the first couple of bites .
yelpers let me down on this one .
the chicken was an initial hit but was short lived .
i did n't finish it nor did i want to .
nor was it flavored in any manor .
$ 20+ for soul food that was so bad .
she promptly replied that they are not doing any to go orders !
even for dessert that takes _num_ minutes ?
but i must have mistaken the establishment for a restaurant , silly me !
after checking with management the hostess returned and reluctantly took my order .
either way , i will not be returning to the central location .
not impressed at all .
why did n't he offer to get me a fresh plate ?
hardly worth that long wait .
asked to give cash then they asked to write my credit card number down ?
are they crazy this is still the hood ?
too much fat , grease , and sugar ... .
good for groups was a big no for us .
appreciated all _num_ plus people that came in .
how hard is a salad with chicken .
never came the owner was very rude and did not care .
you are never too far up ... to fall down !
not worth the price or the wasted time to eat here .
i liked their food but their customer service was horrible !
everyone , the greeter , the cashier and even the owner were rude .
when you order your drink , you 've got to try the kool-aid .
so , small piece of chicken chicken , but same big big price .
slow food service and wait staff only filled drinks twice .
overall experience in new building has gone downhill .
the hostesses are not informed on what 's going on .
so bad .
you 're awful .
walk in , not too busy , greeted with a smile .
seated right away , looked over menu carefully as a first timer .
made a decision about my drink finally , still no one came .
checked out the place , did a little people watching , still no one .
no apology , nothing , just stood back and watched me walk away .
dear sir , travel nurse here that all meals are paid for tax free .
it was very crowded and the wait was about _num_ minutes .
the bad : the chicken lacked flavor .
the waffle was small and just blah .
not bad ... not good .
my fiance had chicken , catfish , fries and mac n cheese .
he said the mac n cheese tasted like it was missing something .
overall ... a so-so experience .
the was no standing room inside .
bad customer service .
go to down south instead !
this is the third and final time i will set foot in this location .
from the start the manager was very condescending .
but they would see if they could get me a slice of cake ) !
it is really sad that the level of service is not the same .
it 's a restaurant not a night club .
good food , but the worst service i 've ever had .
_num_ minutes to get _num_ orders of chicken and waffles and a catfish sandwich .
the chicken was crispy , moist , and flavorful .
that was a tad annoying .
our order was brought out by a lady who did n't really acknowledge us .
it was kind of too late , anyway .
worse than when we had arrived .
as for the food , to me it really was n't anything special .
was that too difficult ?
this place will never get my business ever again .
a couple of months later , i went back again and omg !
the other six waited another _num_ minutes for their food .
two other things we did n't like .
the original restaurant on this site was cozy with a couple of small rooms .
also they had a dj playing so loud that conversation was impossible .
do not bother and here is why .
_num_ .
big disappointment .
_num_ .
_num_ .
fried green tomatoes were tasty but the tomatoes were half ripe ( pink ) .
_num_ .
_num_ .
nothing to write home about .
it came off like a trendy chain restaurant getting by on average ingredients .
the catfish was bland .
overall , disappointed .
i placed my order and was excited to have some good fried chicken .
the waitress left and _num_ mins later she set my meal on the table .
it was old , not juicy , and almost cold .
i was like im never coming back to this place .
the side items , collard greens and mac and cheese were very good .
i know he loves fried chicken and would give me an honest opinion .
$ _num_ for kool aid !
the fried chicken is flavorless .
no seasonings at all .
cornbread was dry .
it took over _num_ minutes to get a burger .
this place sucks .
low low quality and high high prices .
horrible !
_num_ months ago and i was reminded why it had been so long !
the service is terrible there 's no sense of urgency or customer service .
i mentioned it to the food runner he rolled his eyes and walked away !
very disappointed , just not worth it !
longest lunch known to man thank god it was my day off .
this gentleman must be related to someone because a manger he is not !
_num_ ) .
no reservations , there were _num_ of us ( _num_ min .
_num_ ) .
_num_ ) .
_num_ ) .
_num_ ) .
_num_ ) .
_num_ ) .
otherwise spend your money somewhere else where they `` thank you for coming '' !
i was disappointed by the lack of customer service at lo los .
_num_ minutes later she comes to take our drink order .
_num_ minutes later we order our food .
no apology no type of compensation for the huge issue .
_num_ minutes later we notice two tables seated after us and one has greens .
needless to say they lost two customers today .
i got the dd ... was too much food for me .
i did n't like it at all .
i also did n't like how loud the music was .
it did give me a headache .
lastly , the service was n't very great .
i 'm not sure if i 'll give them a second chance .
customer service is not favorable .
i will never spend money here again .
the building is adorable , brick wall warehouse feel .
appetizers included fried pickles , fried green tomatoes , & fried corn fritters .
first time going and received the worst service of my life .
basically he just came to waste more of our time .
the chicken was dry and over cooked , no taste .
this dinner is not cheap , for the money , not worth it .
so sadly my first yelp review ever is a terrible one .
not worth it at all !
the greens are mediocre and the mac and cheese is just sad !
the service was slow !
the hostess here is terrible .
people were literally waiting _num_ minutes for a table .
unbelievable .
the acoustics of that room made it incredibly loud .
the ac was icy though , perhaps because we were under the vent .
$ _num_ for a ham omelette .
i hate to say it , but i am finally done with lo-lo 's .
rude .
annoyed and starving we gave up and left .
we ordered take-out and apparently they no longer accept payment upon arrival .
the chicken was dry and tiny and the waffles were super thin .
i 'm sad that such a phoenix staple has gone so down hill .
the chicken was pretty flavorful but inconsistent .
how they fried that sucker to be fully cooked is a mystery .
maybe we 've been spoiled with our homemade belgian waffles .
the look she gave me said i was not supposed to do that .
the service was not very helpful or friendly in my eyes .
not for the people .
i explained that i would like to place a to go order .
needless to say .
i left hungry and upset ( do n't play with my food ) .
about 2-3 week later i called and tried to place an order .
when i spoke to mills he made several bad management decision _num_ .
stating did he tell me that he would take care of my order ?
i replied nothing and hung up .
horrible customer service .
the answer was no !
and no coming to the resturant to order and wait for food as pickup !
ok here is the down - low .
if you have an hour wait , why are the tables empty ?
after waiting a little over an hour , we get our table .
but i was very disappointed with my most recent visit today .
it took _num_ minutes from the time we order until we got our food .
our drinks were only refilled once they had been completely empty for some time .
sadly i do n't think i will ever return to lolo 's .
i ordered a # _num_ ( breast , wing , and a waffle ) .
wife had catfish strips , cornbread and greens , with banana pudding for desert .
food did n't take too long to come , maybe _num_ minutes .
but you 'll wait for it .
_num_ minutes before someone came to get our drink & appetizer order .
_num_ minutes for our appetizer to arrive and another _num_ for the entrees .
we spent a total of _num_ hours there .
it 's a shame ... wo n't go back !
i wish i could give zero stars for terrible service .
this is not the way to run a business .
after being seated , i checked in on yelp and waited for a server .
no one even acknowledged my existence .
i looked at my yelp check in time and _num_ minutes had passed .
i hate when people make excuses .
just apologize and fix the problem please .
i ordered fried green tomatoes and chicken .
maybe _num_ minutes after i ordered .
the tomatoes , no where to be seen .
no apology was offered by anyone .
not the hostess , not the server , nor management .
okay , that 's the end of my rant .
chicken was ok a little pricey for the serving and taste .
without customers then you ai n't got nothing .
might want to take some classes on how to treat paying customers .
and i have n't even sat down yet or tried the food .
no sides - no eggs - nothing but chicken and waffles .
could n't even get a salad .
no matter how good the food is , i will never return here again .
horrible .
very awkward and rude .
not a very comfortable environment at all .
the hosts were staring at everyone like hurry up and leave .
it would of got _num_ if the hospitality was better .
you people are horrible .
this chicken was ok the crust good but the chick was dry .
stay away from the red velvet cake nasty !
food was absolutely horrible for the $ _num_ i paid .
chicken was not seasoned and one piece was burnt looking .
_num_ min wait another hour for food .
not worth the wait .
the food was great , but service was awful !
end hate .
i can not believe i left a tip .
the food was not good .
i usually splurge when i come to lolo 's but yesterday it was horrible .
my toddler did n't even eat their mac and cheese .
it was so dry and disgusting .
no more lolo 's for me .
they brought out new eggs and they were n't even cooked .
like literally my friends were also disgusted .
very disappointed .
and to top it off or server ignored us the whole time !
wish i could give it a big fat _num_ .
well today we had the worst experience ever .
we walked out !
first an hour wait , okay sunday afternoon understandable .
_num_ mins later our wings come out .
nope we did n't even get that .
needless to say , they were way better .
it was _num_ of us .
_num_ mins went by .
then _num_ and i still did n't have my food .
my _num_ other friends were more than half the way done .
also , my order was only partial .
she said my mac and cheese was coming .
she never even checked on us .
i do n't mind coming here again because i liked the food .
i wo n't be dining here again .
the chicken breasts have had no meat on them and have been extremely dry .
either way the quality seems to have gone downhill !
it 's been on my az bucket list for _num_ years .
it was n't very busy which seemed like a plus .
are you kidding me ?
i 'm so angry about my lack of service .
only was checked on one time as well .
_num_ $ for a mason jar of cool aid .
so salty was barely edible and the shrimp was rubbery .
all said and done over _num_ $ for _num_ people for dinner .
i will not be back .
the service sucks , u ca n't substitute eggs for anything .
disappointing customer service .
we waited another _num_ minutes and continued to watch other groups being seated .
i approached the hostess again to find out the status of our table .
the worst food ever !
the appetizers were good but my main dish , the dd , was n't .
the chicken breast was very dry .
food was overpriced for bad quality .
i took back three dishes and our server was rude from the very start .
i would not recommend eating here .
sunday afternoons are extremely busy at this phoenix location .
we had _num_ in our party last sunday .
by the time we parked , the four were standing outside the restaurant .
i was the only one stuck watching other people eat .
this kinda sucked because i was starving !
it was the catfish served plain on a plate !
strangely this stuff burned my tongue because it was n't mixed right .
nothing special !
all in all the service sucked , and the food was super sub par .
so disappointed in today 's visit .
second , we waited _num_ minutes for our food .
the explanation i was given , was `` we serve whatever is available .
shady as hell !
highly disappointed .
decided to sit outside , because it was about _num_ degrees out .
restaurant was not busy at all .
i order # _num_ with watermelon kool-aid and my cousin ordered chicken strips .
that 's unacceptable !
timed passed the waiter only came to check on us twice .
it was not the waiter who took our order who checked on us .
the wait time killed the whole experience .
could n't enjoy the food like i wanted too .
first , the waffles are always dry , always !
nothing like small chicken and thick kool-aid !
parking is horrible .
unprofessional employees so loud .
the area does n't seem safe .
when it was taken the wrong drinks came out .
how does an ipad mess up the order of names ?
it does n't .
ridiculous !
food is okay but pricey for the poor service they offer at this location .
when i spoke with the manager he did n't really seem to care either .
not worth the time .
he is super rude and not fit to deal with people .
i had never not shown up to pick up an order or anything .
very disappointed .
corporate should be getting a call from me soon .
horrible service .
i am very dissatisfied and probably wo n't be back due to the inconvenience .
i hardly use syrup so for me to be left wanting more was surprising .
horrible do n't eat there .
not worth the trip .
the experience was so horrible i do n't really know where to begin .
1st we went here this past weekend during bike week .
so now i got you wondering why the one star review .
the server only checked on us once for refills during that entire wait .
a while later our food comes out and it was horrible .
let me repeat that horrible .
what i got was biscuits and gravy , potatoes and my bacon .
no eggs which i ordered over medium .
the gravy was like paste and all of my food was cold .
not luke warm but cold .
are you kidding me ?
this is not good ole southern food .
i will not go to this place ever again .
i want to like this place so bad !
i ca n't recommend this place in the mean time .
not impressed ... for various reasons .
but not with that ridiculous wait time .
corn bread was good , but a little dry .
that 's the reason why our food was not coming out .
someone needs to fire bruce .
the looked at me like i was speaking a foreign language .
i decided to just leave not worth the headache and wo n't be back .
if i could give them no stars i would .
their tone , body language and demeanor was just foul !
i have never felt so insulted in my life .
needless to say , i could n't eat here .
i could n't bring myself to order .
i ended up going to urgent care because it was so bad .
the looked at me like i was speaking a foreign language .
i decided to just leave not worth the headache and wo n't be back .
if i could give them no stars i would .
getting in to lo lo 's is ridiculous !
ugh ... still horrible service after a year .
pathetic !
no apologies , nothing .
been here an hour , still no food .
the service was not exactly rude but uncomfortable .
towards the end we did feel a bit ignored .
serves is slow and you get help after finish private phone call .
second worst haircut i have ever had !
never received worst customer service in my life !
i hate assigned seats at a concert venue .
Neutral
clear and visible signage to direct you to the correct location : negative .
nothing fancy , just water .
i guess i should be glad they did n't make him pay for it .
do n't get ripped off paying $ _num_ in a parking garage .
way worse than airplane seats in coach !
two jumbo tv screens ( not the best quality ) .
would i see another show here ... not really .
sound is appalling if you 're not square in front of stage .
beer is like $ _num_ .
worst acoustics ever in a `` theater '' style venue .
i have gone back hoping it was just an isolated show , but nope .
every time i find out a concert is here , i am partially disappointed .
why are we packed like them ?
it 's just great alternative music that seems to be lacking these days .
the bartender that was running the liquor portion was ridiculously slow .
i 'd hate to be tall and be sitting there .
have seen quite a few concerts recently and was really excited to see dolly .
she did n't disappoint me , however the theatre did !
half the seats in the house had a limited view of the stage .
it was a mess .
not a venue i 'm likely to return to anytime soon .
do n't tell me ! ''
the very , very beginning of the show was fine .
we are extremely unhappy about our experience .
do n't tell me ! ''
disappointing .
wait , that did n't sound right .
i should have seen am when they were here last time at the marquee .
my sister could not see anything the whole night .
the security guards did n't even try to stop the people running .
getting in was a big mess .
it was very frustrating .
between acts , security gave out little cups of water .
the security guard put out his arm and said we could not go in .
there was very little leg room , reminded me of airplane seating .
of the _num_ water fountains close to my section only one was working .
i will not return for another event .
security is a joke , they think they own you and everyone there .
the show was supposed to start at _num_ pm .
so , everyone was filing in to seats in the dark .
so , i 'm thinking we 'll skip this venue in the future .
was calling to get information on a concert .
do n't know what to say about customer service except pathetic .
things were n't great from the beginning .
i will not use them again .
this company is a total joke .
it still is n't here .
what a disappointment .
the gel and polish do not even cover the entire nail .
very unhappy !
she quickly ran some clear polish over it and said have a nice day .
i did n't bother to go back in and tell them .
i will not be going there again .
very disappointed !
worst nail place ever !
by the 6th day of having my nails , _num_ of them were off .
jenny ( nicest worker there ) was the only one doing anything .
however , my nails were uneven and the designs were different .
this place is horrible .
it makes me wonder how she treats her workers .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
came in the morning and i was the only customer .
paid $ _num_ for a basic manicure on polish free natural nails .
do n't let them rip you off !
this is a poor business practice .
i have had two horrible experiences with this salon .
i booked my reservation several days in advance over the phone .
she said well i 'm sorry there is nothing i can do .
whether she was told about it by her staff is another thing .
very unprofessional ran salon .
they would n't honor the advertised drink special .
avoid this place .
avoid at all costs .
how do you f up a quesadilla , guys ?
stopped for a drink before the symphony .
it was a little busy , but nothing out of the ordinary .
there were a few empty tables ... though most were dirty .
keep in mind , he was not rushing to make drinks .
i find it hard to believe we 're invisible .
atmosphere - decent ... prices - ridiculous .
service was horrible .
horrible service .
burger cooked wrong and it took _num_ minutes to get it replaced .
but i have been trying to eat a little healthier .
also , do n't get the tortilla soup .
not my first place for a drink downtown !
stopped here for lunch today before the opera .
too bad .
we have been here many times but this was not a good experience .
they are sorely understaffed .
the main reason is the poor service .
these folks ignore customers frequently .
thankfully there are dozen 's of options only steps away .
worst service ever !
we walked out , having never been acknowledged or greeted .
i ordered the tomato bruschetta , which was the worst i 've ever had .
the bread tasted stale and left this weird after taste in my mouth .
the tortilla chips and pesto hummus was rather dull as well .
`` excuse me , excuse me , excuse me !
we sat at a booth ... it was fairly crowded .
`` maybe she is n't our server '' , says my aunt .
she said something about we only need spoons .
i really expected better service and probably would n't eat here again .
this place sucks .
the service is horrible !
_num_ people ordered drinks .
about _num_ min later she came back with water and ran away .
we waited about _num_ more minutes and then approached her .
i approached the manager and he was useless .
oh and she never brought the other _num_ drinks .
they do n't care !
when my burger came out , it was undercooked .
very slow service .
i had southwestern rolls and they were not very good at all .
with all the choices in the area shame on me .
worst service ever guy in pink shirt !
waited _num_ mins for tacos .
gave the place two tries for better experience .
gave only _num_ stars this time .
the worst food i had ever tasted .
very dry , no flavor .
disappointed as i was hungry .
slow service .
the worst chicken club i have ever had in my entire life .
no prices are on menu for drinks except for beers .
service was terrible and there was only _num_ tables .
he said they price match their drinks to the other restaurants in the area .
$ _num_ off ... thanks bro .
$ _num_ was the highest priced martini .
not bad but not the greatest that is until the other night .
the service was soooo slow , thought the waitress forgot our drinks .
service was horrible , just horrible .
also , food was blah .
should have known from the poor taste that it was going to cause problems .
nothing like some food poisoning at a dive bar .
tiny salad served with it after two dollar up charge .
just regular tv 's not even as big as those in my kids room .
poor service & dirty glasses .
worst .
too busy to bother .
i ignored him and ate .
if he does that _num_ times a month , go figure .
that 's not the point .
you do n't go to a venue to look at the walls .
you get used to it , but it does n't go away .
we probably missed out on 1/3 of what was said due to horrible acoustics .
out gas , parking and now a blown evening .
i was n't really impressed with this place at all .
my lunch was the chicken taco and green tamale combo .
the rice and beans were n't bad .
ok i can work with you ... make the chorizo burrito with bacon instead .
i get the girl on the phone .
i am completely stunned at the way she talked to me .
the mess up and the way she talked to you .
let me give you $ _num_ store credit . ''
i use it on bb $ _num_ mondays for tacos and burritos .
mmm i could go for some right now .
my eye appointment was a total fail .
i freaked out a little and scrambled around trying to find the phone number .
she said that she did n't see me in their appointments .
i would n't recommend this location !
this place is slow and the staff members are rude .
i made a 5:30 appointment so i got here _num_ minutes early .
but the girls upfront and one that was testing just awful .
maybe they all had a fight or someone died , who knows .
horrible staff and customer service .
manager is clueless !
_num_ hour fitness corporate ripped me off .
plain and simple .
i did everything according to contract and still got screwed !
it works out to like _num_ bucks a month .
the equipment has been breaking all the time .
if costco does n't have their deal again i am seriously shopping around .
i really do n't like this gym .
poor gym with poor lack of customer service .
been going for about _num_ months using their machines .
the biggest problem is that this gym really only cares about getting your money .
rant time .
okay , not everyone likes sports .
i do n't want to watch it .
dear _num_ , leave at least one tv on the news .
news does not count .
more like _num_ hour fitness .
which this gym was like the cali ones i 'm used to .
do not take your children to this location .
( they just turned _num_ and _num_ ) .
i walked in and was asked for an id .
he too asked to see my id .
she advised that she would have someone return my call .
first , the sign still says _num_ hr fitness .
the guy at the front pointed to the la fitness shirt he had on .
i would have just purchased a membership if , it had been offered .
just rude !
not awesome ... not horrible .
it literally tasted like blood .
atmosphere can be warmer if the wait staff smile .
it and took care of the transaction .
husband and quick tips '' .
decided to not return to this establishment .
my biggest problem is the food .
i wo n't be back .
i should have never came back .
i was given a comp for two and went for lunch .
rail ride home appears to be the trend in wrapping this bar .
i ca n't really add much to it .
i was so angry , i got up and walked out .
was it too far for the waiter to walk outside ... ?
i really wish this place well - but i doubt i 'll be returning .
the music did n't fit the ambience .
it would fit a sports bar better .
will not go back there again .
if you are looking for a wine bar then this is not it .
not really , though .
yeah , it came out with cheese ... all of it .
this place was a disappointment in service , atmosphere , and food offerings .
however , the calamari itself was really overcooked and rubbery .
but it 's hard to screw up a basic rigatoni and red sauce .
the actual flavors really fell short .
vegetables were overcooked , cheese filling was bland , and the sauce was oily .
it was weird .
i stayed out by this place .
terrible service and average food .
but no one wants to bother having dinner there .
it 's a failed attempt to be upscale that leaves you uncomfortable .
but this is n't plush ; it 's absent any personality at all .
the owner ( blonde ) was at the bar .
nor did we get menus .
she went back behind the bar and continued cleaning glasses .
finally handed us _num_ menus for _num_ people .
still no hello .
she was informed she can buy fries for $ _num_ .
the guy next to us had the same problem .
she did n't look , respond , nothing .
horrible service .
i 'd give zero stars if i could but it 's impossible .
again , the al a carte thing is n't clear .
nothing inside and a couple of letters hanging on window from the state .
there was barely anything on the shelves .
i 'm not going back there .
this place closed back in may _num_ .
i was _num_ ... .
but , i sure would n't write home about it .
i doubt i will be back .
_num_ years ago i even had my rehearsal dinner here .
_num_ years ago , same decor , horrible service , boring food .
the mt dew was ok .
unfortunately , it has been consistently mediocre at best .
the ribs were barely room temperature .
come to think of it , maybe that is why he is angry .
i 'm still a sucker for all the junk hanging everywhere .
on second thought , i would settle for the way it used to be .
_num_ .
_num_ .
steaks have either been too tough or overcooked .
_num_ .
_num_ .
mashed potatoes lost its sense of flavoring ( bland taste ) .
the place was practically empty , something i never experienced here before .
not at all what i have come to expect from this place .
the lunch menu just seemed out of place with the rest of decor .
worst food i 've ever been served .
brisket , salmon , and chick fry steak all very poor quality .
total waste of money .
mine was cold and not complete .
totally poor customer service .
when the food finally did come it was cold .
if i could give this place _num_ stars i would !
there was a group of about _num_ of us in the bar .
only _num_ tables in the dinning room with _num_ servers and a manager .
i do n't know why they even bothered to bring it out .
you could see the fat just sitting on top .
when i asked about it they aid they would get it .
maybe _num_ minutes later got my mac and cheese side .
lukewarm at best and the cheese on top was n't even melted .
disappointed .
waitress did n't know menu , she look so lost !
bad experience overall .
we were invited to come back and try them again .
save your money & avoid all together .
i love country music but it was too loud .
wish i had seen the current reviews before we went .
its sad that its so bad now .
one table had been waiting _num_ hours .
the other was waiting _num_ 1/2 hours .
we all left dissatisfied with this place .
very disappointed .
clearly cooked at too hit a temp and ruining the edges of the meat .
the only place that was empty !
the place smelled like a old dish rag .
Neutral
huge negative though .
there was a thick layer of dust every where .
this place is terrible .
anyway , the point was to get enough information to put together a quote .
but , it 's not _num_ .
a little dirty place in a bad strip mall .
dark and dingy -- can not see anything in the fitting rooms .
you walk in and no one offers any help or suggestions .
shopped for _num_ minutes and was totally ignored .
i just think it 's so unprofessional to do something like that without asking .
everyone says i now look _num_ ( i 'm _num_ ) .
it would n't even take _num_ for me to be in and out .
i even offered a tip that would cost more than my haircut !
horrific experience .
i told her i thought it looked orange .
terrible !
very disappointed , i wish i would have gotten her name !
its incredibly mediocre .
but honestly , i kept wondering if i was in the wrong place !
the stores just do n't compare .
the most disappointing is the charm of the biltmore is gone .
it 's unfortunate .
ridiculous .
it 's not so bad when the weather is nice .
there was almost no parking available and the stores were overcrowded .
completely unnecessary in a city with so many other quality shopping centers .
i visited this store the second week it opened .
she followed us upstairs and would not let us shop alone .
( like 3pm ) i would not recommend them to anyone .
update : just got off the phone with the owner .
ca n't wait to see how soon they go out of business .
terrible quality for a $ _num_ repair .
worst tattoo i 've ever had !
their name says it all , you 'll either love or hate this place .
they charged me around $ _num_ .
i do n't care if it was a long time ago .
i would not recommend going here for a first tattoo they take advantage .
i probably should have stuck with pizza .
the fact that they had burgers should have been a minor warning sign .
the price for our meal was around $ _num_ .
attended a recent event food served outdoors rather than inside .
no vegetarian salad options as promised for our event .
like others have said , the toppings do fall off .
the mushrooms on the combo side were from a can in water .
the pizza was extremely greasy , like overly greasy .
i would not recommend this place .
this company is going to nickel and dime itself out of business .
worst customer service ever .
i feel there are other pizza places that i will give a try .
_num_ .
not bad but not good either .
if you 're looking for ehh , edible food , this is the place .
the sauce was extremely bitter and the meatballs were nothing short of blah .
we spent $ _num_ on something we did n't order to begin with .
however there lunch sandwiches are pretty pricey .
will never return again except to pick up pizza to take home !
i agree with another reviewer , who asked `` what happened ?
service is just too laid-back .
at other times , the servers ca n't be seen at all .
we were extremely disappointed with the situation that occurred tonight .
i had previously purchased a $ _num_ wax .
my wife will never go back .
rip off !
rip off !
the attached gas station is awful as well .
it 's very annoying .
despite the convenience i will never get gas there or step foot inside again .
at $ _num_ ... a basic wash is not cheap !
worst experience ever .
customer service not !
i will not go back there after such disrespect .
beware , ripped off at bj 's !
how is that the consumer 's fault ?
would not recommend this place .
total $ _num_ out the door .
a far cry from the $ _num_ they use to offer .
but he will get someone right on it .
so no quality work no return business .
i got the _num_ dollar wash .
sure they have an egg fee ?
i am tired and angry at the problem .
after they tell me my car was done it looked terrible .
terrible service !
hit or miss at this place .
yeah i 'm kinda getting tired of this place .
not a hard car to wash .
just not a good job .
i walked past the car wash people and was asked if i needed help .
i really do n't know if they even changed my oil .
i think they just put a new sticker on .
the service was only supposed to take _num_ hours .
half a working day just to detail a small _num_ door .
do not go here !
not even a week later the car stops working again !
ok , no big deal , stuff happens .
the managers excuse was a `` new guy '' .
when i got there i could immediately tell that something was wrong .
$ _num_ to shampoo the front carpet !
but it gets worse .
`` you did n't have any floor mats . ''
skip forward to june of this year .
i 'm selling the truck and i want the engine cleaned .
i can only imagine what goes on in the repair area .
however they always say it 'll be _num_ _num_ hrs max .
are you kidding me ?
i 'm beyond sick of this happening .
_num_ dollar wash .
had to have them re vacuum and it 's still dirty as hell .
i 'm so pissed because now i have to clean it myself .
and this is a waste of my time .
very very annoyed .
just left bj 's and am very disappointed .
we paid for the ultimate car wash and that is not what we got .
they ran our brand new truck thru the wash with the back window down .
i will never come back here again and i want my money back .
waste of money .
so disappointed .
rv bathroom and kitchen area were not cleaned .
carpet was so-so .
we will not be using them again .
wait wait wait .
do n't come here if you 're in a hurry .
not terrible until you consider the _num_ guys standing around looking at their phones .
the tech could n't tell me what adjustments were necessary , if any .
the only people who were n't rude were the cashiers .
not coming back here again .
i want people to know that they do n't treat their customers right .
then he tells me _num_ 1/2 to _num_ hours .
i get in my car it looks like a $ _num_ wash was done .
i give him _num_ hours .
i come back i have to search for my keys .
what 's funny is my floors were not touched .
nothing was different .
they did n't do anything they said they were going to do .
i am not going to stay here another minute .
i do n't know why they promise things they can not deliver on .
i filed a complaint and they are ignoring it .
they are ignoring me now though .
not right .
i did n't even get a call or anything .
get rid of the glass guys and i might use the car wash .
that 's not why i 'm posting a bad review although that is annoying .
i can not believe that a person would treat a customer that way .
austin needs to find work elsewhere .
very very rude .
even after multiple calls demanding an apology the owner never called me back .
i used them through my home warranty in april .
he did n't call their office nor did he care to .
i would n't use them outside of my home warranty .
i am very suspicious of their prices .
awful customer service .
regardless , the job was done and worked correctly after he left .
so i used him again and what a mistake !
the owner is very full of himself and rude .
to not ask and charge a service fee is borderline unethical .
most unfortunate experience .
do not use this company .
however , they were referred by my warranty company total protect .
poor customer service !
sad to say that i got the worst haircut from this salon .
worst customer service too !
: ( i felt rushed and taken for granted .
not satisfied at all !
i would n't recommend this salon .
i was in town and took a chance , and it was a mistake .
i 've never in all my years had such a chop job .
a blind person could have given me a better hair cut .
worst hair cut i 've ever received .
i would give them a zero star if i could .
they kept rushing the process because it was soon to be closing time .
did an uneven cut on my hair and sent me home with orange hair .
absolutely horrible service !
the second time was absolutely horrible .
nobody came to the table for almost _num_ mins .
no coffee refills in the first _num_ mins .
time from placing order till delivered was close to _num_ mins .
but the service was severely lacking .
i 'm disappointed , even for denny 's .
this is the second time they messed up my order .
i gave _num_ stars because the food overall was good .
the second slice was hardly even toasted .
one of my friends meals came out _num_ minutes after the rest .
this location needs to step up its standards .
it 's seems as customer service at most denny 's restaurants way down .
waitress yelling , at other waitress from one end of the room to another .
restaurant is not that busy for place to be that dirty .
i have to wonder why they could n't have told me directly .
this was my experience .
should n't it be the other way around ?
we are past _num_ months and no word on the $ $ .
i visited and waited in the lobby for _num_ minutes .
a week later , i called and left a message for assisted living .
how horrible to treat someone that way .
the administration should be ashamed that this is acceptable employee behavior .
they are not even remotely concerned with your visual well being .
they do n't know whom you are !
terrible .
stopped in while engagement ring shopping with my fiancee 's sister .
i said `` sort of '' and just walked out .
rude staff .
i reply again that i was told paperwork was n't necessary upon purchase .
crappy service , crappy staff , crappy inventory .
do n't bother .
rude , rude , rude .
it did n't even look like our ring !
poor poor poor craftsmanship done here .
lost our confidence to ever consider future business with kay .
save your time and money and look elsewhere .
sadly my experience was less than enjoyable .
so me not knowing this industry said okay .
they do have bands which can have diamonds placed in them for under _num_ .
so after i said i want to just cancel .
they said they would put a rush on the order .
i called back _num_ weeks in , the day before i had to leave .
there is no excuse for this .
stay clear restaurant owners if you know whats good for you .
this is not what bothered me but it caught my attention .
the light turns green and he takes off ... end of story , right ?
wrong !
i 'm seriously about to cry of frustration !
then about a day later the same problem occurred !
i wish it was done when it needed to be !
after they finished it died again !
i complained to the store manager about the horrible pull and demanded my refund .
he refused saying they did do work .
i 've been a customer of brakes plus over _num_ years .
obviously mark i must be lying .
this is where we started off on the wrong foot .
ordered wings with blue cheese delivered to hotel .
maybe i 'm picky , but they gave me ranch instead .
when i called , the guy on the phone was really short with me .
would have been better .
called ahead .
sure _num_ minutes .
that will be $ _num_ .
wings come up _num_ wings .
so why did n't you tell me these things when i called .
surprise , surprise ... another pizza review .
my total was just under $ _num_ .
eh ... it was just alright .
the cheese was plentiful and tasted alright .
the sauce was not that good though .
the crust on the pizza was fairly thin .
i kept picking up an odd taste in the dough .
unfortunately , i gave the rest away to some fellow co workers .
i 've experienced better pizza elsewhere .
i do n't know if it 's just towards me or not .
i sent a note of complaint to corporate mcdonalds .
first of all the chicken sandwich was so tiny !
what is there to say , it 's garbage food .
ugh .
dry , flavorless burger .
fries that have been under a heat lamp since last week it seems .
they suck , food was sloppy .
the big mac tasted stale as if old bread had been used .
anyone that enjoys mcdonalds knows there is nothing worse than old fries .
this was a pretty disappointing place .
what the crap ?
i do n't think i could tolerate this place during daytime summer hours .
currently there is remodeling going on but no sign to who owns it !
a sure way to make sure first time customers are last time customers .
clearly poor management , or no management here !
she told me it would not look so orange after a few days .
well ... that was crap .
needless to say , we wo n't be going back here !
terrible customer service .
excuse me ?
he just told me this is what it is , sorry for the inconvenience .
fletcher 's only charges $ _num_ .
i always warn people i know about this place .
save yourself the headache and just go somewhere else .
tried to tell the guy and he said i was wrong .
plus there customer service is n't that great .
i walk up to the cashier 's line to pay for my items .
waited there _num_ minutes staring at them .
i do n't have time for games or poor customer service .
i put the item on the counter and walked away .
terrible liars .
please whatever you do do n't go here .
i very strongly advise against coming here for any reason .
the service department here is terrible here .
please avoid this place .
they are only looking out for themselves and the money they take from you .
awful service and i completely regret bringing my vehicle here .
nobody fixed my problem .
seriously unbelievable and awful management .
everytime i shop there i go home with dirty clothes after trying on items .
but i did take pictures so they dont call me a liar .
i hate that !
bad customer service , only go here of you have to .
sent defective part and then would not take it back on return .
cheap parts but if it does n't work you 're stuck with it .
if we had not noticed they would have scammed us .
do not use this company .
parts are terrible .
no return policy .
cheap parts that break right away .
horrible horrible customer service .
i will never use this place again .
if i could give a zero i would .
worst place i have ever been to !
i was treated like garbage .
they only said for me to bring my car .
worst customer service ever .
it 's the same price as buying a new part !
i was screwed over and learned my lesson .
karma will bite them in the ass asap .
extremely disappointed .
the service is horrible , management needs to fire everyone and start over .
i drove over to the pumps where i was met by a guy .
he gave me a receipt which i took in to the office .
my service engine light has now come on thanks to these idiots .
it used to be a favorite of mine because you could smoke inside .
now that you ca n't , it 's lost a lot of its appeal .
i do n't like it .
dive bars have local character to them -- they 're local bars .
this place has become just dirty and embarrassing .
i came here regularly _num_ years ago as i lived within walking distance .
just recently i went back a few times .
two stars for cheap drinks and good music , though .
if you can stand the clientele , go for it , i guess .
actually , a `` no hipster '' policy would make this bar pretty interesting .
boring !
we look around , not a person in the place was watching it .
maybe i 'm too old for sassy bartenders in dumpy spaces .
i do n't really visit many truly divey bars .
the next time i came in , it was a totally different story .
not a very good part of town either .
i totally get that this is a dive bar .
i guess i also picked this place when apparently no one comes in .
but honestly i 've been to better dive bars .
the first thing that struck me was the location .
crap !
the lack of crowd allowed my party and i the utmost dedicated attention .
i 'm sure it was flat .
it was cold though .
my first clue should have been that it is on grand ave .
not impressed by this place at all .
the bartenders were not friendly at all and the place looked like a dump .
place it once was ... .
i came here to celebrate my birthday with a friend .
sad , b/c i 've heard great things .
period .
i dig dive bars but this spot is nasty .
my drink tasted off .
no drink menu .
ugh .
_num_ stars ?
ugh .
i ca n't see myself coming back here anytime soon .
clearly , this was not the place for me .
drink was $ _num_ for a well , and it tasted seriously watered down .
they only get business because there 's no closer bar to the trunk space .
tried to get her attention but did n't want to make a scene .
never going back .
my favorite part was getting the shirt .
this place is small , overpriced and just a waste of time .
this is a tough review to write .
no one knew what was going on and the lines barely moved .
i am shocked that no one was hurt or even killed .
this building is old and smelly .
i have never seen a more poorly executed event !
clean , but still extremely dated and usually without hand soap .
this limited me to lo mein , chow mein or rice with veggies .
i ordered the large at $ _num_ + _num_ for chilli oil .
my noodles were over price , and uninspired .
completely disappointed that this course failed to provide notice they were closed .
yelp has _num_ star reviews on them , so how could we go wrong !
so wrong that it almost cost my wife 's life .
there is no way that a bolt screwed in could have somehow popped out .
quoted me _num_ for a timing belt and water pump six months ago .
the dealership quoted me _num_ .
three hours later they call to tell me nothing is wrong with my car .
guess i 'll spend another _num_ at the dealership to fix their fuck up .
Neutral
negative _num_ stars .
_num_ .
_num_ .
you should plan to leave your car for at least half a day .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the food here is sooooooo much better than the nearby state cafeteria .
i do n't get all the rave reviews .
but nothing to rave about !
ugh i hate a dirty looking crew too !
i love this place , too bad it does not love to provide service .
i split the chicken salad sandwich with my friend .
if only the food were as good as the atmosphere .
they taste like anything i could make at home in _num_ minutes or less .
and to make the sandwich worse , the tuna fish was swimming in mayonnaise .
next time i 'm calling the health dept !
we were _num_ of _num_ units that got hit that night .
we learned to sleep w/ _num_ eye open .
terrible management lived there _num_ years the last year was the worst .
would not recommend after all there changes and rules and fees .
although a highly reputable and good product - customer service is lacking .
tammy is not helpful and very rude to customers .
rude rude rude .
horrible on the phone .
food : very inexpensive with _num_ burritos costing less than _num_ dollars .
takeout orders get _num_ extremely small containers per burrito which is not nearly enough .
place your order inside then wait for it outside .
nothing fancy or special , but heck , its cheap .
it was immediately thrown into the garbage by my disappointed gf .
obviously the _num_ visit came first or i would n't have been back .
fine whatever , so i got a bean and cheese burrito .
my boyfriend finished his food before i got back to the car .
i guess spoiled me with real mexican food .
skip if you have a choice .
you may not be so quick to go there .
place reminds me of an outdoor cafe in mexico .
i just visited this place and ordered two burritos of green chili .
the food here is awful .
thought it was a little steep for a hole in the wall chinese place .
everything was bland .
even the fried rice was bad .
avoid this place and go to pei wei up the street .
the food is a million times better and less expensive !
not good .
boring !
idk but i do n't like it so much .
_num_ ) a big patio to take a relaxed lunch at .
the bad : pretty much everything else .
and the horchata needs to be avoided at all costs as well .
i really was not very impressed with the quality of the food .
the only redeeming quality was the chips and salsa bar .
i could not eat this stuff .
i was soo spicy hot , it was inedible .
so here 's the thing , i 've been coming here for years .
fast forward though , and lately it just has n't been the same .
he brought me a refill of guac and that was it .
after such a dangerous , and frankly disgusting , mistake on their part .
that was it , i wo n't be back again .
horrible customer service !
i asked why it was so expensive .
they told me they had to charge me for the sour cream and guacamole .
i told him what i ordered and asked him why it was so expensive .
my first impression of this place was horrible .
not a good way stay in business in this economy , i 'm afraid .
the food here is pretty good but horrible service .
after ordering one person waited _num_ minutes for their lunch .
the table next to us waited just as long .
place is dirty as hell and prices are too high .
big mistake .
the boiled meat was way to chewy and guacamole was almost sour .
flies everywhere and this was inside not the patio !
beyond gross and the tables were disgusting .
wo n't be back again .
everytime i go here i say to myself , last time .
service is horrible .
the staff there speak better english than they put off .
they are not helpful in providing food either .
too much small print for food that costs them nearly nothing .
however , jack in the box is a four star next to them .
-- lost its traditional feel through the remodel .
beans again with no flavor .
it 's salsa , not marinara , people !
-- chili colorado is just thick , no flavor .
-- $ _num_ for the cheese crisp is worth it .
i was not impressed with the atmosphere , service or food .
the food was bland .
my frozen strawberry frozen margarita tasted like a fruit smoothie with no alcohol .
10+ minutes until we could order , and it was not even good .
we finished this basket long before our order was taken .
even the bill paying process was slow .
i had bites from my sister 's plate and hers was equally as bad .
overall , the food just was n't good .
wo n't be going back .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
there was no onion , no peppers , no lime , no flavor .
not worth your time or money .
first off it took the server _num_ minutes to get us our menus .
then it took another _num_ minutes just to get glasses of water .
my entire group wound up grabbing taco bell on the way back to work .
the waitstaff seems to run this place now and they are extremely rude !
they closed and reopened with new management , and it is just horrible .
as many people have noted , their salsa is weird .
ketchup salsa , yuck .
so we asked our server for `` salsa , salsa . ''
she was confused and returned with a pico de gallo looking bowl .
the entrees including a nacho platter , enchiladas ... were okay but nothing memorable .
showed up for a home warranty fix on my washer .
30+ days later , no response .
do not go with this company if you do n't have to .
it took _num_ weeks for them to come out and repair .
it was hard to get a real person live when i called .
a horrible experience .
horrible !
this company does not care at all about customer service !
the technician stated i did not answer my phone .
i missed his call and called back with in three minutes .
my first contact was last thursday ( october _num_ ) .
no call .
no call on monday , october _num_ .
do not use this company !
they do n't have any sense of customer service .
i 've been hung up on lied to and cheated .
avoid this company .
they have very poor customer service .
save your time and money and go elsewhere !
then never fixed my refrigerator !
so , so bad .
today is jan _num_ , _num_ , and i received the washer yesterday .
not a single time has he been available to me , the customer .
avoid this repair place .
mind your own business because clearly you are clueless .
i would not recommend this company to service appliances .
scheduling an appointment took longer than acceptable .
they have serviced the refrigerator _num_ times and have fixed _num_ things .
it is the worst , worst , worst repair place hands down .
avoid them if you can .
worst experience using a company in my life .
the lady in the phone really did n't care .
there are hundreds of better choices .
they were efficient at first calling me the next after i filed a claim .
i had issues with my washer , dishwasher , and stove .
i was like ok how are you going to say something like that .
then he looked at the dishwasher and says it needs a new soap dispenser .
i asked what the issue was and he says needs a new pump .
so _num_ days go by and i hear nothing .
you can pay now if you want ( thank god i did n't ) .
we had terrible service from them on our clothes washer repair .
so , i sent them a video of the problem .
they out right lied to me twice .
i went to this shop and bought a new lamp for my _num_ in .
the new lamp would n't work , after multiple tries .
this is not what was said in our conversations .
in fact their practices probably warrant a phone call to the bbb .
just rude !
the only helpful person in this school was dee who handles all paper work .
nasty .
i wo n't be going back .
price was right taste was wrong .
we each ordered burgers , then we split some fries and onion rings .
there was nothing special on it .
not cool .
bland .
chicago hamburger co is where it 's at .
the only good thing was that they had red cream soda .
this place doesnt believe in seasoning .
chili fries tastes like carl 's jr 's .
_num_ % crap .
not in a burger mood , i went for the fish n chips .
hello , rubbery batter !
but the burgers are too thin and lack seasoning .
very disappointed as i was really hoping to find a great burger place .
the patty its self was just dry and not seasoned very well .
i really do n't get the great reviews ?
there is nothing special about it .
the meat is average , the bun is average , the cheese is average .
they actually do n't have any bbq sauce which i thought was strange .
i somehow spent $ _num_ for a normal cheese burger without fries .
as yelp puts it `` _num_ stars , `` meh .
without being too harsh as it really is n't that bad .
walked back behind that bar and put it back on the shelf .
are you kidding me ?
ridiculous !
the behavior is unacceptable for a mcdonald 's .
i went to hamburger works for probably the 3rd time .
decent hamburgers , horrible service .
we were there probably around _num_ am on a saturday .
there were only _num_ other people in the bar area .
_num_ out of the _num_ other people came after us .
she said she 'd get that taken care of .
she gave us the drinks for free ( she better !
never going back .
we ordered chicken strips , baked potato , and 1/3 lb burger with fries .
the baked potato was find .
overall not a good experience .
fast food would taste better and cost less .
the only reason to go is a nearby bar with sports on tvs .
the employees with the exception of the bar staff seemed clueless .
not a good way to win over customers .
being able to add all the condiments you want yourself is a plus .
it has potential , but obviously lacks good management .
i would n't recommend this restaurant at this time .
i did not , so i just shrugged .
the service was about as bad as it smelled on the bar side unfortunately .
i went with a bacon cheeseburger on wheat .
pass on this place and take your hard earned cash elsewhere .
very disappointing experience at the hamburger works .
but customer service is awful .
just be be careful who 's on staff they might bite .
do not get the bloody mary .
okay , the burger was n't that good , very dry and really flavorless .
the place was pretty run down .
the bartender was beyond rude and impatient .
hey burger works , food handling is n't all that difficult !
in the years passed i would have given this place _num_ stars .
the chicken sandwiches and burgers are no longer consistent .
avoid this place unless you 're desperate .
instead i left hungry and angry .
over the past year or so it 's really gone down hill .
neither of which knew how to cook a burger .
after years of going here , sadly i will not be going back .
shame on you duke !
below is the comment i sent them , i 'll keep you all updated .
Very positive
the negatives :
the negatives for me are related to food pricing from my point of view .
i think i saw turkey legs for $ _num_ at one booth .
nothing should cost $ _num_ at a fair food booth in my opinion .
i really tried to enjoy the fair in _num_ .
here 's wishing for better things in _num_ .
place sucks .
this place however , does not !
my part has been done and i will not eat here ever again .
the food is worse then subway .
and you can tell with one bite .
trust me on this this place is an epic failure .
over priced dried out sandwiches in a cramped spot with crappy parking .
it was one of the worst sandwiches i have ever had .
number _num_ the bread was so burnt it was not edible .
the roast beef was rubbery and old .
the dip was cold .
_num_ bucks for a nasty sandwich and potato salad and a drink .
not worth it .
the place looks old and dirty and smells like burnt bread .
just left this place without getting food .
and as the owner , walking away from the situation is even worse .
i 'm hoping this does n't happen often .
bad service , waited about _num_ min to get order in .
stood at counter , nobody greeted you .
you walk in and smells like burnt bread .
he did not look happy .
now , i have to search elsewhere .
anyway , i chose this place because of the glowing reviews that it had .
you could tell that the tripe itself was n't very fresh .
ordered the asada , pollo , lengua and barbacoa tacos .
al pastor was n't on the menu which was disappointing .
did n't have chips when we asked the waitress .
had a salsa bar but the salsa was very bland and watery .
salsa bar did n't have onions and cilantro to put on the tacos .
they are really much more hype than substance .
it 's not a `` skipped '' payment .
it 's really an amateur operation .
use to be a _num_ star !
they said that they have too many accounts that are n't being used enough !
not business friendly !
the worst .
but they 're _num_ % crooks .
really feel they need to come into _num_ .
sadly will be returning to a big bank .
horrible .
absolutely horrible branch staff & management .
all the bad reviews are true .
the list goes on and on .
avoid this institution at all costs .
i am contacting the bbb again .
this company has no compassion or loyalty to its customers .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
i tried twice with a _num_ credit score .
_num_ .
there are very long wait times .
_num_ .
their savings account will give you 1/2 of _num_ % interest .
_num_ .
calling the bank does n't help answer your questions .
i like it but then i do n't .
but i feel like i get cheated too .
these pathetic liars makes money off lying and stealing from its customers .
so , out of the blue there 's a fee after a few months .
and , this answer is the trap .
there really is very little benefit .
Negative
unfortunately i have to agree with some of these negative reviews .
when they realized their mistake they declined the loan .
incompetent .
no one tried to keep my business .
arizona state credit union gives headaches .
does n't it sound fishy to you ?
their website is often down and sucks when it is up .
it apparently was n't worth their time .
i guess im not scene enough for this place .
guys in girl pants , here is your venue .
damn that place is hotter than a steam room .
this is not a good review .
the gal told me only if the unit was cracked .
she said they would not .
however , an entire new unit is only $ _num_ plus labor .
she put me on hold for about _num_ minutes , not an issue .
really , she told me this .
they saved me money .
gilbert , az .
the pm mark was pretty sub-par in my opinion .
as far as clothing goes there is n't much of a selection .
Negative
i wish i could give this business negative stars .
that is a $ _num_ trip charge .
after all , propane is not my business .
nor would any one of you agree to it as it is absurd .
never going back .
i gave this company _num_ tries .
they are rude and unprofessional and ghetto .
i would rather not waste my time with this employee and their trashy employees .
no phone etiquette or manners .
my taco tasted just like kfc .
while it may actually sound kind of good , no , it was n't .
it was crowded and not friendly .
this place was messy and loud .
overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food .
you call that a green sauce ?
their chips are n't anything special either .
service was ok , carne asada tacos pretty good .
price is cheap .
i went through the drive through and ordered _num_ burrito and chips and salsa .
got home and realized i didnt have my burrito .
the girl didnt ' seem to care .
she said they could charge me for a new burrito .
i 've never had beef fajitas like this , very disappointed .
the staff was not friendly at all .
i could n't even taste the chile with all that goo on it .
i found out this was a bad idea .
the chicken taco was good , the rolled tacos were not .
i spit it out and lost my appetite when i did .
if you go i would recommend that you stay away from the rolled tacos .
this place is gross .
the food is not good at all .
went to listen to a band play and grab a bite to eat .
my drink was flat when she brought it out .
it was soggy and nasty , i only ate half of it .
what happen to this place , the owner got greedy and needs money .
the food was good.
i did not check my order and went home .
( about _num_ miles away ) .
i entered the dining room and waited my turn .
the cashier refunded my credit card transaction in cash .
my biggest issue with this whole situation is that no employee ever said sorry .
but tonight our shredded beef tacos were literally sour .
wo n't be going back .
i should have read the yelp reviews before ordering my burrito here !
needless to say never going back .
my wife and i stopped by on the way home for lunch today .
my wife ate half her torta and though it was decent .
it 's unfortunate , because i thought their burritos were pretty good .
sometimes you just want awesome neighborhood mexican take out .
this is not the spot .
i do n't understand how anyone would consider this place decent .
overall , the food was extremely bland and had no flavor whatsoever .
decoration are very dusty .
bathroom was not very clean .
after waiting for _num_ hr for menudo , finally had enough of waiting .
will not be eating that menudo after all .
they charge more at the registers than on the menu .
they still have sleazy waitresses not servers who encourage patrons to buy more drinks .
then i waited _num_ minutes for my food and was really disappointed with it .
drinks were terrible .
they use a low end mix .
disappointing .
i ordered a carne asada burrito and i was very disappointed .
the burrito was basically beans and very little meat .
i went through the drive through for a breakfast burrito .
they were pretty busy so it took about _num_ minutes to get my food .
having worked in a drive thru location before , i understand that entirely .
that sucks , because i do n't care about that .
thank you to the manager who actually recognized i was waiting for a while .
atmosphere is loud and chaotic ; however , it was a friday night .
i had _num_ item combo and not impressed with my food .
while the food here is pretty good , the customer service is lacking tremendously .
just went in today and ordered two lunch combos @ _num_ .
even though that is not what the drive up menu says .
are you kidding me ?
any good service skills know that that is unacceptable .
and you lost a returning customer .
it is suppose to be white , i made menudo for _num_ years .
are you sure they 're not serving horse meat or dog meat ?
went there tonight .
my _num_ item combo was lackluster .
all items were very bland and we had to add salt .
the service was typical counter food .
him treating one customer like they do n't matter is not right .
it cost you nothing and goes along way .
i would not waste my time on this place .
very mediocre food and really just about like a seat in taco bell .
i ordered a # _num_ and got the totally wrong order .
what 's the point of drive _num_ miles back the opposite direct .
the people that own this place have no customer appreciation .
they literally do not care .
did not enjoy the meal .
parts were cold and very greasy .
tacos fell apart .
meat was tasteless and tough .
rice had no flavor .
they forgot one item , fortunately did not charge for it .
will not return here , many other choices available .
horrible service outside .
garbage !
food is expensive not the quality for the price .
the cashier was soo rude .
personally i did not like this place .
will not be coming back .
thumbs down !
worst customer service ever !
they tell me that no , i 'm not on hold .
so again , i ask that my order be taken .
so i get in the back of the line wait till its my turn .
not what it used to be i am sad to say .
we ate and left and we are never coming back .
$ _num_ is not the problem , their attitude is the problem .
just awful ... shame on you public storage !
where has customer service gone these days ?
there was no follow up by the sales person when this error was realized .
poor , horrible customer service .
my first night , i ordered their brooklyn spaghetti and meatballs .
served with a filthy handle cover , and a rusty , or dirty knife .
the white bread that was substituted for garlic toast , was n't even toasted .
the waiter said he was sorry , and he was right .
food tasted horrible , and for what they charge is just ridiculous .
the food was okay , it 's typical denny 's food .
if i could give a rating of zero , i would .
do not eat here .
waited _num_ minutes for food , with no explanation or apology .
rather defensive waitress offered us drink refills when one of our party complained .
will not be stopping here again .
service was subpar from waitress stephanie .
the redeeming factor was the waitress named india .
i ordered bacon very very very crispy .
what i got was rubbery undercooked bacon .
horrible service .
the service is ok but the food is not worth it .
we went in _num_ weeks ago on a tuesday night .
if not , its very unfair practice .
the manager is called and tells me she can not do that .
i am sorry but i am a business owner and used to work retail .
bad eggs and awful service !
the location looked quite and peaceful , but was anything but .
am i the only person who has ordered just pancakes from denny 's .
the cook have me dirty looks from the kitchen all night long .
i really just wanted to leave as soon as i ordered .
the most horrible experience ever !
would not recommend this location to anyone .
when we entered did not even get a greeting from the hostess .
then we received no menus .
their water is really gross though , they should really fix that .
it was put back together wrong .
this guy does n't know what he 's doing .
wasted trip .
either way they should not have waited _num_ days to tell me .
one star .
it 's just not right .
nothing got fixed either .
nice enough people but i lost all respect for this place .
through w them this is too much !
given them multiple chances but they ca n't get it right .
nasty !
wrong .
however , walk-in service was fast and friendly .
horrible company .
owner is greedy and does not treat people with respect .
i would not recommend doing business with this company .
shame on grand avenue produce .
Negative
grand avenue produce gets a negative star !
this was probably the worst hotel location i have ever stayed at .
the rooms were nice , but the plumbing was awful !
did not take out the trash either .
this place needs a lot of changes before i 'll ever come back .
this hotel is a shit hole and so is phoenix .
our rooms smelled like piss and sweaty gym socks .
gross !
it takes _num_ minutes to wipe this stuff down .
we checked in and our non-smoking room reeked of smoke .
proceed with caution .
i drove from north california with a late check in .
the breakfast is only bread and stale muffins .
first off , this is a motel ( i.e .
on saturday night there was a friendly security guard walking the property .
the room smelt ... weird .
it just did n't smell so fresh and so clean .
wifi super slow .
but really is n't for what you get .
there is no fridge .
the only good thing is they allow `` pets '' .
horrible place !
i refused to use their towels because i do n't think they changed them !
yelp rating system should have an option that allows reviewers to choose no star .
sometimes experiences are extremely that bad .
this brought in sleazy and trashy individuals who ruined any chance or relaxation .
i did not feel safe in this environment .
where is the integrity in lying to an agreement promised to the customer ?
this place was not clean .
i will not be returning to la quinta inn and suites ever again !
i 've stayed in worse places .
so if you like a _num_ star hotel , go somewhere else .
it 's a _num_ star maybe a soft _num_ star hotel .
needs updating , bedside lights do n't work , sketchy neighborhood .
broken curtains , and the bathroom walls had stains .
this is the worst la quinta i have ever been in .
i ca n't even begin to list items that are wrong !
it 's more like a motel _num_ in a really bad area !
we stayed here on april _num_ , _num_ .
he woke her up , and she was escorted to the lobby area .
around this time it was past midnight very late .
so i jumped in the shower .
i burned myself and ended up falling hard from the shower !
so the receptionist ended up going to our room to fix the issue .
this time , we did not have any parking space .
we could smell the '' body odor .
in the room and the bed sheets just looked extremely filthy .
i do not recommend this contractor .
it takes me _num_ minutes to walk to my car in the morning .
i would give these people _num_ stars that is how angry i am .
do not ever hire them .
they jack up contract prices by _num_ % .
my advice stay as far away as you can from these rip-off artists !
dynamite is far from being da bomb .
coffee cup sat empty twice for just over _num_ min each time .
disappointed with my most recent experience a generally great place to eat .
waited over _num_ minutes for food .
heard good things about this place and was sorely disappointed !
i made the mistake of ordering a side of home fries .
much to my surprise , i was billed $ _num_ .
i feel bad for others who do not have the technology .
shame on you .
this is the worst company i have ever had to deal with .
i would give them a minus _num_ if there was such a rating .
suffice it to say i would not recommend them to my worst enemy .
my review is a zero review as well !
i hate this company .
the only way to get a decent rate is to sign a contract .
do not use waste management ... worst customer service ever !
that 's bad customer service imo .
i used only _num_ days of a _num_ month billing cycle .
save yourself the frustration and use republic if you have the option .
do not use this company !
waste management has been over charging for quite some time now .
i know its _num_ pm , because we have a reminder on our phones .
they are extremely overpriced and do not offer any quality of service .
i have had their service for _num_ years and can not wait to cancel .
as time when on , my bill raised to $ _num_ per month .
the can was delivered over a week late with no lock or instruction .
as you can see , their extreme fees are completely unacceptable .
they should change the name to the greasy pit .
i 've never eaten a taco with so much grease before .
it also sent me running for the toilet a couple of hours later .
you 've been warned .
sadly i think i wo n't me coming back .
we used to wait hours to get served back in the day .
old meats , waitresses that never , ever , come and check on you .
large portions too .
i had their # _num_ pho , meatballs and sliced beef .
never saw that before in a restaurant .
the meat did n't look too fresh either .
their waitress looked like she just woke up and rolled out of bed !
gross .
not at your restaurant .
i 'm not so sure if i would go back .
bun bo hue was pretty awful .
but , sorry to say , their food is not even close to standard .
huge mistake ; it looks like a good one but tastes nothing like one .
i will not be going back to this place .
also , they are a little pricey than the others considering their location .
his voice was so loud that everybody stopped talking .
really should give one star for service but product selection gets them two !
highly recommend since it is impossible to find a reliable mechanic .
shame on you , pep boys !
no respect at all these people clearly hate the career path they have selected .
do n't go here for anything .
way over priced like a few hundred dollars !
dont come after dark .
the wait is extremely to long .
the waiting room is crowded & dirty .
would give less than _num_ star if i could .
be prepared to wait a long time .
absolutely ridiculous .
no one ever checked on me , or even apologized for the wait .
this place is an absolute joke .
i hate the this place so much it 's not even funny .
had the worst experience in this place .
this was n't one of those times .
i was there at breakfast time , and ordered huevos rancheros .
it ruined everything .
i should have complained but i was too tired to bother .
never had a urge to eat here until recently .
do not know how this place stays in business ?
i ordered a breakfast burrito , it had eggs , sausage , and potatoes .
nothing special , something i could have made up at home .
there are too many options in this area to eat at .
this place really needs to change .
this makes it very difficult to keep your items organized .
the major problem i had was with the estimate .
terrible service !
_num_ % of our boxes were smashed .
do n't use this company .
they took forever and did n't communicate well .
spent $ _num_ and they gave me a big bag of trash !
rude staff .
cold inedible chicken .
no wonder my food has been crap not once but twice .
do not go to this kfc .
only to be told here `` some can and some ca n't .
so i went ahead and parked so i could go inside .
there was only one person servings walk ins .
not really , thats why no one wants this job .
however i do n't want to hear that they deserve $ _num_ an hour .
hell , most managers do n't deserve that .
this place is way to slow .
workers need to show some effort , and manager needs some training .
if i wanted more sauce i would have cost me an extra .
i was so disappointed in pete 's .
would n't get again .
would n't get again .
would n't get again .
i think gross might describe these .
i hate ketchup .
this was the biggest disappointment .
this place is garbage .
i hate giving places ratings this low , but i have no choice .
the food is disgusting .
it 's fried imitation crab sticks .
it 's just the food that is so bad .
never again !
the fries were limp and flavorless .
this place is super cheap and the food reflects why .
horrible .
fish is not seasoned , has zero flavor .
the `` shrimp '' is a joke its like _num_ % breading .
and how do people think this is cheap ?
the only joy i found in the bland food is the sauce .
place is creepy .
i ended up getting the hell out of there .
do not waste you hard earned money .
no flavor , no compensation for poor service and poor product .
it must be different in the day time .
i ordered the quarter pound bacon and cheeseburger and fries .
stick with the cheap burgers and wings !
not as good as it was back in the day .
it is sunday night and i put in my order online .
that is completely wrong !
i am very displeased !
horrible service received yesterday .
it goes promptly downhill from here .
i 'm sorry , why ?
i ordered the garden party , extra sauce , no cheese . ''
thus , it is not correct . ''
-- to drop the ball .
with _num_ tables occupied we sat down and waited for our server .
normally , i ca n't finish two !
and it seems like it was swimming in soy sauce !
`` it 's chili colorado which is red sauce . ''
i stuck with the red sauce .
the sauce was good but the beef was chewy and a little tough .
the beans literally tasted like lard !
i get better mexican food back home in las vegas .
for some reason we thought we 'd be getting awesome mexican food in phoenix !
the enchiladas were good but ruined by too much cheddar which overpowered the enchiladas .
an excuse for not taking it all .
overall , fair food , poor service , much better options out there .
sorry yelpers this was awful !
cheese crisp was made with an old tortilla .
sick .
cheese was barely melted .
cheese not melted in the enchilada and the tacos were on these weird shells .
sick sick sick .
sadly , i have to update my review from _num_ stars to _num_ stars .
she cleared chips and salsa without asking us if we were done .
horrible experience compared to previous visits .
we will try one more time as this may have just been a fluke .
the food was just alright .
i actually tip more than their forced tip charge .
just does n't sit right with me when that is n't made clear .
not to say the really slow and bad customer service .
sorry but will not come back even if i did n't have to pay .
a friend told me this place was a place to get great mexican food .
we spent over $ _num_ for lunch for three people .
such a disappointment .
but they got _num_ out of the _num_ meals wrong .
there was _num_ minutes left before closing .
when the bowl arrived it was big enough to feed at least _num_ people .
going # _num_ if you get my drift .
restaurant impossible should stop by and help this establishment .
but not taking my business there again !
i used to go to rita 's in the _num_ 's .
whenever it changed ... it was not for the better .
i do n't know how they pass their health inspection .
this place is pretty bad in my opinion .
find another mexican food restaurant in the area if you 're really craving .
i was basically on my own to train myself .
the weight room equipment is very old and limited .
i gave this place a legitimate review based on my experience .
we had to wait _num_ hrs for a _num_ $ dot exam .
drink station looks as if it has not been touched in years .
staff were not happy .
a woman walked in covered with items for sale ... .
not sure how this placed passed any health inspection .
no grade was was seen posted .
run down , terrible food and overpriced .
the staff seem to hate being there .
this is the worst dental experience , i have ever had .
he must not care about repeat customers ... he never called .
once they complete this work i will never be returning to this place again .
so here i am after getting all my dental work done .
_num_ crown which included one of them being a full root canal .
so do not go to this place !
they do n't even deserve a star it should be a minus star .
industrial towing should be avoided at all costs .
i returned to pick up my car and it was gone .
( check arizona republic for stories ) .
please avoid this tow company .
plus , the chorizo was pretty bland .
heard great things about kay 's , unfortunately they were not true !
we arrived at _num_ on a saturday and it was busy but not full .
our server offered us menus _num_ minutes later .
the biscuits were fine but the gravy was pretty bad .
could 've used some sausage in there too !
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
he will not return calls .
it has been _num_ months since we have had a proper order come in .
do not use this company .
but i do not think this company cares .
bread was stale today .
but i figured hey maybe it fell in there while it was cooking .
this is lame .
all they use is celery , sprouts and onion !
flavor bland !
i will not be back .
i am so incredibly disappointed in the assistance i have received from phoenix college .
i would not recommend this college based on the experience i 've had .
calling to get an issue figured out ?
but during on a one on one session ... this is not the case .
however , this is a college , lol .
the only thing i liked about this place is the parking .
other than that , it was sub-par .
!
i only gave it one star because i could n't give it less .
none of them seem to know exactly what they are doing .
however , there are some major improvements needed in the cafeteria .
so this review goes to the cafeteria .
i was greeted horribly by the guy who work there .
the carpets are worn to the floor .
the hot tub is a one person small bath .
at almost $ _num_ a night , never again .
they do not handle issues in a timely manner and have shady business practices .
in our case , they required a _num_ day notice to end the lease .
the problem is this property management company looks at a tenant as rent insurance .
the _num_ day notice was not acknowledged or responded to for over _num_ month !
included was a cashier 's check for $ _num_ .
it took _num_ full months to get $ _num_ back from these people .
do n't rent from them unless you are a real estate attorney !
do n't think i will be back on a poker night .
should n't there be a sign or something ?
oh well , the bartender is nice , the beer is cold .
i rate only _num_ stars because the facility is older and kind of grimy .
then he proceeded to tell my friend it was $ _num_ not $ _num_ .
_num_ on your side so quick to judge companies and side with the consumer .
well , i was wrong .
oh no , so you 're saying i have to go to the mall ?
they have kids doing it .
i 'm angry and this seemed like the most appropriate outlet to vent .
not only to go through with it , but to face my mother after .
kind of pretentious , snooty , & stuck up .
the moment i walked in i was kicked out because i had my daughter .
sorry , halo .
you lost a customer .
bad business .
worst place ever !
do n't go there unless you want to be treated like crap .
so off to halo we went .
ugh .
do n't you want the service ?
incredibly horrible customer service .
she acted annoyed , like i was bothering her .
big mistake ... .
came home & it was horrible ... .
it fits horribly , it sticks out and i will never wear it .
waste of $ _num_ .
she was polite , but was rushing me .
but personally , i would not recommend this place to anyone .
i have been to this shop several times we even had a piercing done .
wo n't be going back again .
it was such an awful experience .
she was very rude and short with me .
probably the same girl the review below was talking about .
do n't even waste your time talking to her .
shame on me tho .
i 'm only one person , they have lost my business !
the workers were very rude .
the same _num_ or _num_ same bands play every night .
a visit does n't even warrant a listen to your heartbeat .
dr. cohen would like to see you in _num_ months . ''
as it stands , i will not even consider returning to this particular practice .
to make matters worse i thought dr cohen was awful as a doctor .
i wish i could rate dr. cohen separately from the business itself .
it seems voice mail is the only option offered .
for that reason alone , i will not be trying this office .
i just want to schedule a general _num_ month check up for my daughter .
seems to be quite the trend here .
dr cohen is a good doctor however you almost never get to see her .
the office staff is rude .
also the office is located within a terrible neighborhood .
dr cohen is a good doctor however you almost never get to see her .
the office staff is rude .
also the office is located within a terrible neighborhood .
next appt is sometime in july .
if you can not count on your dr then , when can you ?
ive always valued her opinion but now i 'm completely frustrated .
an urgent appointment with another provider , _num_ .
medical advice for the emergency , _num_ .
we 're glad you appreciated the care for years .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
just generic answers i could find on the internet .
_num_ .
was not offered an appt a week later .
would n't let me come back at a better time .
i 've never had anyone demand my keys before .
not worth saving $ _num_ .
there 's no way i 'm going back there .
i know , i know .
i 'm just ugly .
it 's always kierland , kierland , kierland . ''
gag me .
my only hope for this once famous mall , is the light rail .
do n't hold your breath folks .
if you 're looking for the mall , is n't it obvious ?
my girlfriend had her car repaired at this firestone location back in march .
it was n't cheap , but her car was running when it left firestone .
so , why not ?
hours later , i get a fax .
it 's laughable .
for this specific repair , parts and labor would be about $ _num_ .
that would be an additional $ _num_ or so to fix .
`` it 's not leaking .
they will not be getting any future business from me .
these guys here are n't friendly .
customer service is truly lacking .
will not be returning .
do not use these people .
i was told it would take _num_ minutes .
two hours later and i 'm still waiting .
not happy , not coming back !
avoid firestone at all possible costs .
i made a 10am appt for _num_ days later .
total lack of respect of my time and money .
big mistake .
set up an appointment for 11:30 for an oil change .
why set up an appointment if you do n't respect your customer 's time ?
gross .
unprofessional & disappointing .
did n't hear from him , so i called the office two days later .
left a message with their receptionist and asked to have him return my call .
i wo n't make that mistake again .
who has only _num_ rep in their store .
at time of scheduling i informed the receptionist that i had braces .
i gladly went to another dentist and had to have two teeth removed .
one could have been save if treated correctly .
teeth cleaning was sub-par .
i wo n't be back , and i would never recommend this dentist .
that was over a week ago and no response .
i would not recommend coming to this office .
everyone hates the dentist , except me .
hoping that once the bill was pass due they would actually call me back .
instead , sent me to collections .
poor business practice and terrible customer service .
sounds a little scary , where did the information go ?
patients that utilize dental insurance , beware .
i 've been going here for _num_ years & will not be going back .
apparently _num_ minutes is `` shortly '' because that 's how long i waited .
so i was in the office a total of _num_ minutes .
all in all , a disappointing experience .
terrible place .
avoid at all costs .
i went to this staples because it is close to home .
hell no , who has time for this shit ?
almost _num_ hours later i get a call .
could n't someone have called me in those _num_ hours and told me this ?
they got the job done but the quality of service was horrible !
the staples was nearly empty that time , too .
their bathrooms are no longer available for customers , another change for the worst .
i returned _num_ hours later and it had not been touched or completed .
my coworker was going to start looking , and i had to pee .
he simply said that they probably did n't have it and to look online .
well maybe they 'll stop by on monday '' .
um , yeah , that 's not professional !
frustrating when dealing such an important and expensive event .
would not recommend this company .
i would n't even come here if i were dead !
i unfortunately have had to meet richard more than once .
i hated kfc for the longest time .
why only _num_ stars ?
this is the worst kfc location ever !
most of the time my order is wrong when going through the drive through .
then , my order was wrong .
the staff are not necessarily unpleasant , but certainly not customer focused .
the food is inconsistent .
add in the long waits and this is certainly a place to avoid .
do you enjoy standing at the counter for _num_ minutes just waiting to order ?
worst customer service !
i went in one night after dark and the counter was just abandoned .
it just went downhill from there .
this is the worst damn kfc i 've ever seen .
so far worst kfc i 've been too in the phoenix area .
i would give no star if it would let me .
no `` sorry about the wait '' `` sorry for my rudeness '' whatever .
okay i then ask politely `` _num_ please '' .
again returns with no comment .
take some customer service classes kfc employees , learn how to treat people .
if you do n't like your job , then do n't work there .
plain and simple .
by far the worst ever and a waste of almost $ _num_ .
that 's like charging a fee for the plates or cups .
sorry , kfc .
i am not a fan .
it was very thin and flavorless .
the bacon was thick , the avocado and the other toppings were great .
this place is gross .
it all tastes the same - greasy and disgusting .
we will not be going back .
absolutely the worst place in the entire valley .
was on my way home , thought i would give it a shot .
i ordered random items ; chicken taco and onion rings .
the onion rings were so blah i did n't even touch them .
it sure beats the hell out of this joint .
i got the chicken enchilada plate with rice and beans .
quit being cheap , get better meat or change the name .
worst burger place ever .
felt like i was eating school cafeteria food at best .
what kind of restaurant turns their shake machine off at _num_ pm ?
came out to like $ _num_ , and my order was wrong .
very disappointed .
my eggs were so overcooked they looked like shredded rubber .
then the cook put the buns on to toast ... still no meat cooking .
i wo n't be back .
terrible customer service .
but if you want to be treated like your business matters , go elsewhere .
but the lady in the drive through window has a bad attitude !
however , i have had several bad experiences with the restaurant .
picture it , two scoops of rice with various vegetables .
$ _num_ each ?
it was n't even as if it was a large serving .
this is about where the good stuff ends .
does it not travel well ?
nothing like the dish i was expecting .
kebab lunch plates for $ _num_ !
even the $ _num_ lamb gyro was not worth the price .
the food is average in my opinion , the service slow & rude .
i ca n't imagine why people would rave about this place .
have you people never eaten anywhere better ?
mine was n't much better .
had lunch here last week with friends and really was not impressed .
mostly everything is served with rice or some kind of bread .
to tell the truth i did not find this flavorful but kind of bland .
i went vegan _num_ months ago .
i spend a ridiculous amount of money on food .
so ... most places ... a meal like this would be _num_ dollars .
the falafel i did n't think was that great .
the price was not equivalent to the quantity or quality .
the worst persian food i ever ate .
hummus was tasteless .
i wo n't be back .
i have nothing more to say than stay away .
really awful .
but it 's not persian .
no more than say ... mcdonalds .
so not persian food .
gyros are greek .
even farther off ( but closer than grilled cheese ) .
because no stars was not an option .
no lights on .
according to the information here , they should be open .
when we arrived , it was pretty dead .
i was so disappointed .
we got the hummus and it was lacking flavor and was super runny .
i do know it was n't good .
my coworker did n't really like his stew either .
i wo n't be going back .
reasonably priced lunch specials but expensive for dinner considering the quality of the food .
even their hummus is mediocre .
do n't have high expectations if you go .
terribly bland , boring , overpriced food .
overpriced for the quality or flavor you get .
i have n't had much luck choosing new restaurants lately .
unfortunately , this place lacks just that !
our appetizer took about _num_ minutes before it was brought out .
not sure why it took so long because there 's nothing special about it .
this tasted like cardboard and looked like it too !
about _num_ minutes later , our dinner followed ( timing is impeccable here ) .
our meal consisted of basmati rice , chicken and beef kabobs .
the basmati rice did n't carry that special aroma like it usually does .
the beef and chicken lacked any kind of flavor or seasoning .
disappointed to say the least .
very disappointed .
the food was not fresh .
the bread was totally stale .
finally , the kabob was reheated as i could hear the microwave .
very disappointing .
the plate of food was barely lukewarm .
the dough ( yogurt drink ) was good .
too many other choices in the area .
i spent forty bucks on leftovers .
embarrassed for you .
i said , that 's weird .
wo n't be giving my money to this small business again .
bad , bad business .
karen said `` obviously we can not make you happy '' -- what ?
`` obviously , we are not going to be able to satisfy you .
diamond 's was just plain bad .
we waited _num_ minutes at the table for water and menus .
this restaurant does indeed have a problem with general cleanliness .
i ca n't imagine that this could be the standard in another country .
this is the largest cockroach i have ever seen in my life .
i was mortified such that i could not find my voice .
i was going to be sick .
ugh .
the toilet was already full from someone before me .
someone needs to shut this place down .
not this time , i pass .
let me preface my review by stating a few facts .
all in all , i would never go back .
menu says crap puffs ... that should have been my first clue .
bad .
very bad .
oh my god , please do n't make me eat here ever again .
like thick , gooey goo .
i do n't know , maybe i 'm a snob .
i do n't know how this place is in business .
fried rice tasted fishy and the pork was totally dried out .
sweet sour chicken had no vegetables .
my understanding is that this dish has peppers , pineapple , etc .
i 'm not sure i want to see in the kitchen !
this place has horrible customer service .
it took _num_ minutes for a waiter to come and greet us with menus .
we walked out .
we lasted about _num_ minutes in this place .
one family walked out as we were getting there .
tl ; dr - mediocre food for super low price after a long wait .
walls grimy ; the whole place needs a steam cleaning .
impossible to talk with owners as they barely speak english .
unfortunately the service was terrible .
there were three tables of people and there must have only been one cook .
the waitress did n't come around for at least _num_ minutes .
it was the worst food and customer service ever .
it smelt horrible as we entered , like old fish .
it was very dirty and run down .
service was slow , food came out before the soup .
food was bland and tasteless .
overall , just a real low quality experience !
i used to eat here as a kid , will never eat here again .
very disappointed .
i called to find the location as she could n't remember .
i called _num_ minutes before appointment but was on hold for almost _num_ minutes .
the gal said we would have to wait since we were late .
she was told it should n't be long .
i would never recommend there unfair services .
my gosh , bad , bad mistake taking my unit there .
he says nothing .
no advice , no close look and no explanation .
labor $ _num_ .
`` i do n't know , i did n't put it in the box .
yes , maybe , and maybe not .
who originally spent $ _num_ for bikes they could hardly afford .
it 's a shame ; i saw some floor models i liked too .
bummed out , i thanked him for at least looking at my bike .
the attitude these guys have is unbelievable !
i just did n't feel welcomed .
they seem to hate that there .
told me they could replace they the tape and that would solve the problem .
fast forward _num_ week .
response , `` you definitely did something to it '' turned and walked away .
they sad they would research it and get a solution to me .
it has been _num_ days and i have not heard from them yet .
no biggie , i sent in a $ _num_ deposit and all was great .
you will waste a lot of money .
horrible !
the oil very obviously had n't been replaced in who knows how long .
i am not a picky eater by any stretch .
avoid items like lengua , tripe , or various organ meat .
carne asada fries were disappointing .
terrible service , every time .
i left with a bad taste in my mouth , and no food .
i wo n't be going here again .
this place could be so much better .
but i think i might be the only person still buying these .
do n't expect anything more than average customer service with ridiculously high prices .
i only purchased because it was time sensitive and i needed it immediately .
unfriendly little place .
no tab system -- - was told to just leave it on the counter !
i could n't believe it !
my purse had money and my passport in it !
wow , now i 'm even more irritated after reading other reviews .
just , no .
i 'm sorry i spent any money there today .
thankfully , it was n't a lot .
wrong .
so rude and disrespectful to paying ( gay ! )
and it appears from other reviews that this is not an isolated incident .
no thanks !
stupid music and just all wrong !
no thanks charlie !
same thing .
overall , i will probably be back.
i walked in with a group of _num_ .
sorry , but i hate this pathetic place !
poor phoenix , people just do n't know better in this city .
it 's kinda sad , actually .
as a gay man , i want to like charlie 's .
unfortunately , on any given night only _num_ % of the patrons are attractive .
a shockingly low number .
if you look hard though , you can find some gems .
probably works there .
the next time i went , i accidentally stood in front of the door .
f this place and the dirty vibe within and without .
the music sucks .
_num_ .
they charge you _num_ bucks to use your credit card on their drinks .
if i do n't have cash , i 'd rather not buy any drinks .
_num_ .
bartender said there were not any that night .
wow , what a slap in the face .
this is bad karma !
it was so not all that lol .
i 'm not likely to come back .
this place is not worth a cover charge .
it 's phoenix , not new york darling .
all we got was more and more frustrated at the entire experience !
the patio was useless for non smokers !
what a wasted use of space where the volleyball court is !
i do n't know where they got him but he needs to go back .
i will never come to this horrible place ever again .
to give you some background , i frequent west hollywood several times a week .
i am not new to the gay scene .
excuse me ?
i hate this place .
it 's the absolute worst .
you 've been warned .
the queens here are so rude including the fat ugly ones .
i like charlie 's for the most part .
the music was terrible .
ew , never again .
i would rate it _num_ stars but that 's not possible .
every time i have come here i have been treated badly .
gave the dj $ _num_ on an extremely slow sunday to play a song .
only good thing about this place is the taco truck connected to it .
i know that the reason it even has _num_ star is because of this .
guys watch your cash , bartenders always try to rip you off .
they treat you like crap .
huge mistake , but i 've learned my lesson .
he had grabbed me pushed me to the ground after throwing a punch ... .
had to give it one star b/c could n't give it zero .
back again on a tuesday and they clearly do n't care .
bar staff is really attentive but the music is still awful .
honestly , not a fan .
but it 's just meh .
but that 's the only highlight .
why people keep coming back here is beyond me .
lame .
second time going here and was just as horrible as the first .
the place is just sad .
the drag show was to long and forgettable .
i suggest everyone forget this place exists and go some where else .
even with the drink specials it 's not worth it .
beyond rude work staff .
do n't waste your time or money .
my friends dragged me here one time .
not my type of place .
i would n't give this place a star if i did n't have to .
the staff here is very unprofessional .
get over yourselves already , you 're not doing anything great here !
this is a fucking sauna .
fucking ridiculous .
seriously their staff just does n't give a shit .
not such a big deal though .
disappointment # _num_ : the doctor had no people skills at all .
but no .
i mean come on dude you 're sticking a freakin light in my eye .
but no i received nothing of the sort .
oh no something 's wrong '' .
i 'm just used to a more friendly office visit .
i wish they would have just talked to me is all .
is that too much to ask for ?
i could not believe it .
needless to say , i will not be back to see them .
there is no added value at all .
( _num_ ) `` no guns '' sign on the front door .
update : they also screwed up my prescription .
worst experience ever !
i understand there may be traffic problems , car problems etc .
i was then called in for my exam by the tech .
tamales do n't compete with local fare .
just not spicy enough for us .
now that is just wrong and bad manners but unfortunately it was true .
i 'm not even sure i 'd ever give this place a second try .
unfortunately , they are totally unreliable and inconsistent .
did i ask for rice and not get any ?
why did n't i learn my lesson after my second visit ?
and i 'm a mediocre cook .
no delivery on orders .
_num_ .
what mexican restaurant does n't have carnitas ?
_num_ .
no complimentary chips and salsa with order .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
there are too many restaurants around here to choose this one .
they used to put the salad in a bowl and tape it shut .
she said the tortilla for the cheese crisp was stale and just lousy tasting .
it was gross .
there 's just too many good mexican restaurants to waste your money here !
the enchiladas are not good .
the rice is boring .
maybe i just ordered the wrong things .
like william t. i too have been coming here since high school .
i 'm _num_ .
_num_ miles round trip .
highly disappointed on all levels .
my tostada was so soggy it was disgusting .
food was awful !
also they breaded the chili relleno , it was absolutely gross !
the cheese enchiladas had no flavor and their red sauce was just bland .
the rice was undercooked and a bit dry .
my ground beef burrito was mostly tortilla and red sauce .
the shredded beef taco was dry and underwhelming .
i will not be spending my money here again .
however , the customer service is seriously lacking !
i ordered a carne asada burrito and some chips and salsa .
when i got to work and opened the bag , there were no chips .
i will not be returning to or recommending this restaurant .
said the only thing i would go back for is the shredded beef tacos .
like most places reviews on yelp in phoenix , this place is over rated .
okay , it 's cheap .
found it pretty boring and plain .
wo n't be heading back anytime soon .
the prices are not cheap enough to warrant such crappy customer service .
the food is mediocre at best .
this place is mediocre at best .
it 's like they do n't even try .
there are so many better choices .
what a disappointment .
the order counter is efficient but lacking in personal touch .
the building looks exactly like what it is : a whole in the wall .
the meat was extremely cold , chewy and lacked seasoning .
i would not come here again for the food .
however , the guy working the register was really sexy , friendly and helpful .
ate here this weekend and what a disappointment !
tacky !
what the hell happened to this place ?
i guess the owners just do n't care anymore .
wo n't be back .
my boyfriend and i went for lunch here due to the high yelp reviews .
they could literally not try any less .
would not recommend .
nope i will never be back .
so freaking gross .
it did n't make any sense to me .
the wait for the food was over _num_ min ... for take out !
it was dirty and the food basically sucked .
the enchilada was soggy and flavor was worse than put of a can .
i would n't recommend this restaurant , unfortunately .
super disappointed .
this restaurant lately has not been good .
too bad because it has long been a favorite of mine .
$ _num_ for a bean burrito .
the cheese crisp was chewy and frankly missing the cheese .
the only thing worth eating was the salsa .
ordered the carne asada burrito with rice and beans .
we were hella hungry so i did n't care and ate it .
being mexican , this food was disappointing .
if you want some real burritos , come to california .
the place is a dump , the workers are either idiots or rude .
inconsistent , all beans and no meat , staff is clueless .
the taco was ok ... rice and beans what a joke !
so , i guess we can complain .
ive been _num_ times it think last time was yesterday ... .
it not the worst but i ca n't recommend it anymore ... .
-- everything just a little bit healthier than you 'll find elsewhere .
the service is fast yet friendly and the food is mediocre .
the food is ok , not exciting or great , just ok .
the coffee is bad , it looks like coffee but tastes like brown water .
for this visit , the huge downfall was the service .
after our food was brought out , our server never stopped by again .
in closing , i can not recommend this place for a meal .
the eggs were disgusting !
they were bright yellow and had the most bizarre texture .
_num_ stars .
i went to first watch for first time and will not be back .
the potatoes were burned .
i also feel like they were frozen potatoes .
the chicken i had inside felt like rubber .
the service was not as wonderful as everyone is saying .
it took at least _num_ min for anyone to come to us .
after we got our food about _num_ min later the waitress brought our bill .
but by then i was disgusted by the food i honestly was ready .
it was ok i guess .
i had the huevos rancheros , hubby had the traditional breakfast .
most likely wo n't visit again .
had to wait _num_ min after being seated to have anyone see us .
the restaurant staff were not even in a rush at this time .
they instead if a english muffin you have a choice of a muffin .
i just purchased a gun from this pawn shop .
took it out to fire it and the darn thing does not work .
and all we got was boring old ice cream .
i never knew i was an ice cream snob , until this evening .
i mean , i 'm sure its not the worst i 've ever tasted .
( but , i am struggling to think of worse ice cream . )
maybe they were just having a bad night .
i had to be like _num_ years old .
rip off and slow .
ice cream didnt even taste good , it was watery .
not really impressed with their ice cream .
would not go back again if i want ice cream .
the sign on the door listed the closing time as 10pm .
that was fine as that was all we desired .
the menu stated clearly that closing time was 10pm .
i did not know what he ordered .
low and behold , our sundaes were delivered to the table in styrofoam .
this was very disappointing .
i , however , was extremely disappointed .
it took them around _num_ minutes to serve me a chocolate shake ... .
not worth $ _num_ though .
what a mistake .
it looked like an old diner and was some what packed .
she gave me a blank stare and asked me what i ordered .
i told her the butter pecan and she rushed off to get it .
i was so disappointed and gave up on the dish about half way through .
sadly , we had a horrible experience there tonight .
tonight , i went with kids .
the ice cream however , left a lot to be desired .
on the drive home i could smell onion rings .
unable to figure out what it was ... until i got home .
the bag and all of the containers smelled of grease .
no bueno !
and quickly down water .
meh ... never again .
slow service and overpriced ice cream .
the three of us ate maybe half of the sundaes .
the cone was flavorless and fell apart before i finished the first scoop .
hot fudge sundaes are not made with mint chocolate chip ice cream , idiots .
this place has really gone downhill in the last couple of years .
as someone who loves fried meat and junk food ... these just were nasty .
painful .
this time it was n't !
bananas are dirt cheap .
the guy that 's on the register is straight up stupid .
been coming here for years .
seems like the past two have seen this location in decline .
consistently slow service , inside as well .
the mix is way off .
too much syrup .
did i mention the slowest drive-thru ?
this particular franchise appears to have really poor management .
nothing special here just over priced mexican food .
got two breakfast burritos and paid $ _num_ .
the score is low because the delivery is slow .
i gave this place a try two times .
unfortunately i will no longer return .
not so much anymore .
i gave them three chances , and its still not good .
their food used to be excellent , but now it 's awful .
the last _num_ times i went there , the food was just horrible .
i tried one more time , and the beans they gave me were grey .
it cost over $ _num_ for an enchilada & a grey bean tostada .
food was a disappointment but not as bad the service .
no one was complaining , so i figure this is pretty typical .
smoking here will continue and no one will mind .
just leave any filtered cigarettes at the door . ''
this place just sucks .
and who the hell 's idea was it to carpet a bar ?
on one side there is whatever excuse for musical what not is going on .
one point for cheap drinks .
i 'd rather just sit home and drink myself to sleep .
this place is hard to rate .
this is n't a `` lounge '' by any stretch of the word .
close to 1am the bartender ran out of small glasses .
there was no way i 'd be able to get drunk here .
at least the beer is cheap , i guess .
this place should be hidden from sight & left to die .
you probably wo n't have to wait if you wan na play !
having one unique brew just does n't cut it these days !
maybe i 'm just missing something really cool about this place .
tacos here suck .
vegetarian fast food options are limited .
i like the food but i always get the runs ?
no excuse .
then , they got my order wrong .
the food is also garbage .
i got a sausage egg and cheese burrito .
i ordered the jalepeno honey chicken biscuit .
very disappointed .
absolutely the worst taco bell food i 've ever had .
a complete waste of time and money .
we wo n't be going back.
the last four times i 've been through they have n't had any pizza .
unacceptable .
take the `` pizza hut '' sign down if you do n't sell pizza .
worst taco bell .
never going back .
worst taco bell ever .
i never have this problem on 3rd st !
a $ _num_ combo turned into $ _num_ .
$ _num_ more and still ca n't get it right .
my son wanted just a trim on his long hair .
not too cool .
expect to wait 1-2 hours to see the doctor or nurse practitioner .
my new doctor has contacted them several times and no one has responded .
just charged me for a bunch of tests i did not need .
now i have a $ _num_ bill and i still do n't know anything .
they are rude and unprofessional .
if i could put zero stars i would .
i had a horrible experience at this office .
i work in the medical field so my frustration was even higher .
i arrived _num_ needs early as requested when i made my appointment .
i had previously filled out my paperwork so i was ready to go .
i waited _num_ more minutes then was called back .
then she got up and walked out .
i spent maybe _num_ or _num_ minutes max with her .
he never once looked me in the eye !
how rude !
the people in this practice are rude and could care less about their patients .
avoid this practice at all costs !
i do n't have any complaints about the people who work there .
but they tell you to wait up to two weeks for results .
i really needed to begin taking medication .
this is not typical or acceptable .
if i need to adjust my medication , i need to know asap .
so , i am going elsewhere .
the office staff is awful .
i never did .
this place is horrible .
by far the worst staff ever .
not to mention that i never got a reminder call .
i go to a lot of doctors and this is the worst ever !
and , the staff is completely rude and disorganized .
very frustrating !
that is absurd !
there is n't a lot to choose from anyway .
my teriyaki chicken was just meh .
the chicken was a little overcooked and the sauce was so bland .
the egg roll was okay , a little soggy though .
anyway , this place is definitely not worth going out of your way for .
my rice bowl tasted decent and generic and i finished it halfway .
and it smelled like fish .
she also did n't finish her eggroll .
i got a chicken teriyaki bowl , a california roll , and crab puffs .
the chicken teriyaki bowl was the only thing that i could actually eat .
sushi is supposed to be bite sized .
the crab puffs were large but the filling was just horrible .
i wo n't be going back again .
the place is dirty and the bathroom is filthy and stinks terribly .
do n't waste your time , money or appetite .
they do not deserve to stay in business .
i would not recommend this place .
he my order wrong and struggled to understand what i wanted .
i stopped in for lunch last friday and ordered a teriyaki bowl .
i put it back into the bowl and threw it away .
that is something i would throw away and not serve to anyone .
please avoid this restaurant no matter what you want to eat .
where 's the beef and overcooked tofu , with very little veggies .
we made this mistake twice , we wo n't be back .
buyer be where dont go here , go next door to subway .
the quality of food is not good .
the sauce is the same sauce from _num_ years ago .
unfortunately the chicken is fatty and the beef is thin and gross .
i used to love this place , unfortunately i feel it has fallen off .
i do n't recommend paying $ _num_ for low quality .
there are too many other options with better quality .
called to let them know and was offered a discount on my next visit .
clearly will not return .
it was awful .
no flavor , the chicken was fatty .
took two bites and threw it in the trash .
just did n't seem fresh .
for $ _num_ i would rather have chipotle .
do not recommend !
gross .
it was noon on a weekday and only three customers .
that should have been the first clue .
the chicken was dry and tasted old .
the vegetables tasted old and were inedible .
even the rice sucked .
gave this place another try .
i was disappointed .
in the _num_ 's i went here during my high school lunch hour .
i am quite certain the standards have fallen greatly .
this place is always dead for a reason .
teriyaki sauce was totally weak and tasteless .
the breading was very soggy , with no crunch at all .
it does n't take much to run a place like this .
i 'm so disappointed and angry .
overly over price to be in the hood !
i stopped there to meet him for a business appointment .
he started yelling at me for parking next to one of the gas pumps .
i apologized and told him that i did n't realize that he was open .
screw this place and screw john !
prime was not .
it was not yummy .
it was not inexpensive .
it did not refill soda drinks .
it had no other customers .
thai rama , malee 's ... others have better soup .
i expected a lot better from the reviews .
very disappointing .
it was never terrible or inedible , just blah .
i am just not one of them .
omg , the food here taste like it was prepared in a dirty toilet .
i got the crispy house chicken , and the wor wonton soup .
the soup lacked salt , and had barely anything in it .
the fried rice was mushy , and the egg roll was overcooked .
yelp , i 'm shaking my fist in your general direction .
the egg rolls are more like egg roll tapas .
moo shu chicken was flavorless .
lemon chicken was a mess of soggy chaos , wonton chips overdone .
for the life of me , i do n't get its high rating .
nasty !
nasty !
nasty !
no scrambled eggs !
there was enough salt in mine to stop my heart .
my husband 's sweet and sour chicken was not a success either .
needless to say , we wo n't be back .
o dog blew in for some to go .
prices up and portions weak .
goodbye my once trusted prime .
very disappointed with the orange chicken .
too many other places for asian fare .
do n't waste your time or money .
by the way - the orange chicken made me feel lousy .
prices are not bad but selection could be better .
i have always felt the customer service was terrible .
ok so i go to turn it in .
_num_ days late now .
i would not recommend this office to anyone .
i always went for very basic services ( routine cleanings ) .
i called dr browns office and asked why they charged more .
why would they not bring this up when i first scheduled my appointment ?
penny is bad at her job and is very deceiving .
i would not recommend this practice .
i have since changed dental offices and i never owe anything .
i have never been so frustrated with a group of people like this before .
the scheduling and especially the billing lady are the most incompetent people .
she gave me all these excuses as to what the issue was .
none made sense .
the problem was fixed !
she did not apologize .
she was actually very unprofessional and rude .
this place is unbelievable !
i called to cancel and was treated so rudely .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
this is why i do not take my dogs to alta vista anymore .
no thanks .
i do n't do doctors who do n't listen .
needless to say , we have n't been back .
however , i will no longer be bringing my pets to alta vista .
keep in mind , queen was _num_ .
i could n't bear to have her sick at all any longer .
worst vet ever !
terrible service .
she did not even address half of my concerns .
dr. **** was extremely rude and unprofessional .
had a very bizarre and disturbing experience with alta vista .
i would not go back or recommend them to anyone .
then we were moved into an exam room where i again waited .
the strange thing is there were no other patients the entire time !
i was already sitting there a good _num_ minutes , really ?
i could n't believe it .
she was very friendly and the reason why i gave more than one star .
they scheduled me for 6:00 pickup .
i could go on for another _num_ pages ... .
it was a nightmare .
no one ever called me .
the doctor was an incompetent ass .
everyone kept apologizing and but there was no excuse for this mess .
for years we have left our beloved pets here when we go on vacation .
not the german shepherd .
i had this little chi for _num_ years and she was my constant companion .
i would n't trust this place with any pet for any reason .
i will never get over losing my dog in this manner .
they refused to offer any other alternative .
total time they spent with him : _num_ minutes .
it was very disappointing .
i 'm not a dog nut and i do n't need fluff .
they were getting ready to close at noon , this was on a saturday .
then waited another _num_ - _num_ minutes .
so i said there 's no way .
i 've had dogs all my life and this was a scam !
they just gave us a $ _num_ estimate for crap we do n't need .
shame on money hungry alta vista !
it seriously was the most uncomfortable experience in a veterinary office .
i just had one of the most disrespectful and disappointing experiences at alta vista .
another _num_ minutes go by and no one has entered the room .
your total is $ _num_ . ''
it was beyond rude .
very strange experience with alta vista .
the staff immediately responded and ran some tests .
nothing wrong other than the fact that he was near death .
either there is hope to save an animals life or there is not .
i do not expect anyone to work for free .
my warning is be careful with this place .
they seem to me more compassionate to the customers wallet than to the animal .
the last few years i feel its completely $ $ money driven .
_num_ week later !
i 'm gon na start looking for another vet for my remaining _num_ dogs .
i 'm very disappointed in alta vista .
my experience today started out just lackluster .
the vet tech seemed totally disinterested in me and my dog .
however , the kicker came when i was getting ready to leave .
if i had not called , i would n't have known she was there .
as owner she does n't know who 's responsible .
the owner only repeatedly told me how many happy customers they had .
this is a big problem for me .
had i seen him inside the building i would have lost it .
just terrible .
this is the first review that i have written that is under _num_ stars .
this was not the case here .
so i knew they were gon na have a hard time .
it was just so ridiculous .
what a huge waste of time .
brought my elderly dog in for appt due to bleeding from her nose .
i never walk out of this vet without spending $ _num_ .
Neutral
a week after this appointment ( valley fever comes back negative ) .
Negative
leaves message on my phone that tests are negative and more than likely cancer .
it was beyond ridiculous .
i 've never been treated so poorly in my life .
no way in hell was i going to allow that .
Positive
negative stars for their lack of people skills i suppose .
they are ridiculous over priced even for a vet .
alta vista was the closest emergency vet so i took him in .
not to mention they were incredibly apathetic .
so i left , with my dog .
alta vista is a terrible place .
i am not impressed .
for both of my appointments they failed to call and confirm prior .
twenty minutes after _num_ they asked if we could do a drop off .
sorry alta vista .
for a very sick cat .
and he was still sick as hell .
and they ignored me .
tired of this .
did my dog get better , yes .
however , i was really put off by the lack of costumer service .
i doubt i will go back .
if i could give less than one star to this place i would .
vets seemed young , inexperienced and at best unhelpful .
but i am only writing you to warn other pet owners .
i ordered the taco salad with beef machaca .
it was so bad i was unable to travel for work the following week .
and i can not understand why people do .
the food is n't very good , and the margaritas are just as bad .
i 'm paying for this shit .
i really hated this place .
first of all , our server was hardly ever present .
in fact , our entrees were served and we never received our app .
as for the food , it was far below mediocre .
i got the beef flautas and they were awful .
the meat was as dry as can be and had absolutely no seasoning .
the shells were somehow soggy and flavorless .
everyone else did n't seem too thrilled about their food either .
i hate this place .
i will never be back .
i could walk here from my house .
it 's cheap and has a big menu .
i am so disappointed with mi patio .
but that is not what happened at all .
they were horrible !
nothing that would make me come back though .
i think maybe i built it up too much in my head .
the chicken tacos arrived in what appeared to be homemade taco shells .
the shells are thicker and seemed to be deep fried and a little greasy .
the chicken ( as another reviewer stated ) is deep fried .
it 's not that great .
now i know why they are so cheap ... where 's the alcohol ?
honestly , i could n't recognize anything but the flautas .
it looked like a salad .
i should have went across the street to the _num_ hour mexican food joint .
he was a white guy .
my chimichanga was weak ( i know its tex-mex haha ) .
good margaritas , mediocre food .
bad food .
bad service .
i ordered a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream on the side .
you could n't pay me to eat here again .
friendly staff but food is simply mediocre .
wo n't be recommending it .
back in phoenix and back to mi patio .
it was good but nothing special .
he was not welcoming or talkative , just doing his job .
no one stopped us to ask why .
they just did n't care .
cheap food and cheaper margaritas do not a good restaurant make .
i 'm afraid i just do n't understand the hype of mi patio .
i did n't really care for the salsa .
also , the chips were stale .
my husband had beef tacos with rice and beans .
he did n't finish his plate .
however , as i continued to go there the service seemed to get worse .
the last time was most upsetting and made me decide to never return .
we were pretty convinced that our waiter was high .
the margaritas are good but cheap for a reason !
for me , i ca n't bare to chance it .
also had one of the cheap margaritas , which was nothing special .
i am pretty sure the salsa was made using canned tomatoes .
i would not recommend .
chips tasted stale and salsa was just so-so .
i would not recommend nor will i be back .
do not get the taco salad !
way too much guacamole and sour cream and it is really bland .
kind of a mess .
the rest of the restaurant experience is horrible .
the restaurant was n't even full .
only _num_ other tables when we walked in .
service was not attentive in the least .
soft drinks were flat .
if we lived in the area , we would n't go back .
disappointed that yelp took me here on such high expectations .
service was n't much better .
that 's how strongly i disagree with the current rating that this place has .
the worst i have had here in phoenix .
not true at all , all of the food is drenched in yellow cheese .
the food was gross .
i asked for chile verde , hold on i asked the guy .
should not of done that , food was nasty .
will not go again .
so disappointed !
maybe it does n't exist at _num_ on friday nights .
food was disappointing .
i was extremely disappointed .
i trusted yelp and this time i got burned .
the service was slow but very friendly .
so _num_ star for that .
the chips seemed stale and the salsa was mediocre at best .
the service was terrible .
the staff seemed extremely indifferent towards the guests .
it was just not good food .
first of all , this place has too much going on therefore very noisy .
two beef tacos , rice and beans .
the rice not only looked as old as the moon but tasted awful .
the beans were tasteless as well .
the complimentary chips and salsa were just as bad .
rice & beans had no flavor .
some people enjoy this trash , i on the other hand have higher expectations .
this was my 5th visit .
i 'll stop giving this place anymore chances .
would not recommend it for someone that likes authentic mexican .
woke up in the morning with a craving for some comfort food .
as i entered i was greeted and seated promptly .
the coffee was hot but possibly reheated .
i have had worse but also much better .
the plate was drowned in the yellow stuff .
the carne was ok nothing to write home or yelp about .
unfortunately i will not be coming here again .
my husband and i went here for lunch .
it was so loud you could hardly hear each other talk .
a very generic response .
i ordered the baja burro and my husband got the patio chimi .
there was no cheese on my husband 's chimi .
he asked for it , but never got it .
the food was greasy and the flavoring on my chicken was horrible .
cheap drinks made with cheap booze .
one of the worst mexican restaurants i 've eaten in .
disgusting .
service was awful as well .
waited _num_ minutes just to have drink orders taken .
really really bad food .
all warning signs were there so shame on me for trying it .
warning sign # _num_ - sunday morning at 11:30 am nobody in resturant .
still we were stupid enough to try it .
ordered food - a lot arrived - it was all terrible .
another sunday morning and $ _num_ i will never see again .
that 's ridiculous .
the food was terrible .
as noted : disappointing .
this place is terrible !
took forever to get any refills and the waitress lacked attention !
would certainly not come back here any time soon !
disappointing .
very disappointing !
the waitress and service was nice but my god the food is horrible .
very very sad .
i wo n't be back .
pricing , it 's ok .
ugh .
i wish there was a minus _num_ stars for this place .
he proceeded to tell me he dry cleaned them himself !
bad experience , bad service and bad place to do business .
very unhappy !
they do not have the expertise to properly work with them .
the owner was not there .
the clerk said she would leave a note on the cover for the owner .
that was not comforting .
dropped off at 10:30 on a wednesday .
requested them to `` comp '' one shirt .
a discount of $ _num_ on a bill of $ _num_ .
at this point the older lady made a comment under her breath .
then , i met the older lady .
she is the reason why i have not returned .
she handled the payment because the older gentleman was called in the back .
her attitude was quite condescending .
went in to this place looking to get my watch repaired .
it was a very unpleasant experience .
diane and his son are very rude and unprofessional .
i will not be bringing my business here nor can i recommend them .
bad service , bad attitude , bad selection .
this shop is the reason why internet sales have shut down boutique stores .
not the selection or the price .
someone must have knocked into it in the parking lot .
about $ _num_ for the mirror replacement .
now you all may have money to burn but i dont .
yes a total price of $ _num_ .
seriously no customer service .
$ _num_ for a side mirror .
how dare you charge such outrageous prices because i drive a lexus !
your not going to screw me buddy sorry .
they seem to be irritated that i have returned to make things right !
too much attitude .
my service advisor , matt , was very unprofessional to say the least .
will also report this to bbb complaint id _num_ .
would i recommend this company ?
absolutely not , you will be overcharged , and ripped off .
i also noticed dirt marks left behind by the workers in my back seat .
save yourself additional money and stress and go elsewhere .
she never paid much attention to what she was doing .
needless to say , i had very uneven haircuts after both visits .
if i could leave a zero star , i would .
once we got to the car , he broke out in tears .
late review ... was here about _num_ months ago .
i would suggest talking less and being for caring for your customers .
do n't need to take a visit to the chiropractor after a hair .
will not return to this location .
but , now i am looking for another place to cut my hair .
it was horrible .
she did the haircut in _num_ min .
the fade and side burns were uneven .
nothing serious , just an upset stomach or the like .
so gross .
i chose three chicken chunk items .
let this be your warning .
the food was not bad , but it just was n't interesting .
oh god what a disaster .
most are though .
too bad .
the only way to describe it was sub-par .
i did n't try it .
i have only had lunch at pino 's so my review is limited .
however i have had lunch there over _num_ times in the past _num_ years .
avoid these items like the plague .
ownership and staff is mildly rude .
counter staff turns over frequently .
horrible customer service !
i purchased a huge calzone using my debit card .
i co-worker challenged me to a pizza taste test .
the pizza is not bad , but not as good as i like .
they charge _num_ for a diet coke refill !
several customers were coming up to the counter looking for missing food .
ours came out quickly enough , and was accurate .
none of the pies looked particularly interesting ; i went with the vegetarian .
nothing seems particularly bad , just underwhelming .
a little steep for that neighborhood , i think .
how in the world does this place get a _num_ ?
well there are no rewards here for that !
excuse me ?
sigh , so much for my favorite pizza place .
the service was very slow and the pizza was so disappointing .
her loss , pino 's loss .
sadly , no more .
then she makes eye contact with me and asks me what i ordered .
the guy sitting there was nice though .
i felt bad for having to deal with her .
the owner was there ... he did n't say hi to me .
he did n't ask how the pizza was , he did n't do anything .
it was n't anything spectacular .
i would n't ever go out of my way to go there .
actually i would n't even go there if i ran into the place .
so disappointing !
disgusting .
i greeted him with compliments of my past experiences at his restaurant .
no apology .
no meal comp .
no nothing .
i placed a deliver order for two large pizzas for my office .
when they delivered the pizza they did not bring any parmesan cheese or peppers .
they said she would call me back within _num_ hours .
still no call .
so there you have it -- horrible service and food !
biggest complaint - _num_ for the slice , _num_ for a soda .
than you want to charge me _num_ for a refill ?
ridiculous !
the cost of having customers return ... priceless .
sorry , guys .
basic takeout pizza options in phoenix still suck !
place has not been cleaned since _num_ .
smells terrible .
but it was n't really close or convenient to go to .
i happened to be in the area so figured would check it out .
food was less then spectacular .
totally from a box , flash frozen .
the pork nugget inside of it could stand to be a bit bigger .
the pad thai was flavorful , the noodles were a tasty pile of mush .
so it was n't all bad .
in fact it was n't bad tasting .
atmosphere is ok.
kinda old , cute menus with home made paper .
this place might have been around for _num_ years .
but when there are not better options .
i am not done with thai rama .
canned peas and corn in my soup and curry .
no thanks .
i 'm disappointed .
well , the beef was very strange in texture and oddly shaped .
the flavor was very mediocre .
but i probably wo n't be back , either .
not that great .
its just the sauce was bad .
price was ok .
i really was hoping for a better dish .
friendly when they took my order and when they gave me my food .
i guess i just need to try a different dish .
their curry reputation is reason to go back .
between the spice and the temp of the soup , it was too much .
still my friend found it too spicy , and i call her over again .
unless you 're up for a tuesday night cat fight , just order out .
we waited _num_ minutes for our dinner to arrive .
the service was slow , but the waitresses were very friendly .
overall , i would probably not recommend this restaurant to a friend .
but the food could n't save it .
the veggies were not fresh , they seemed to be canned .
when i was about _num_ or so and hated it !
all three were fails in my book .
too sweet and the noodles lacked definition .
finally , the green curry came and it was very salty .
drinks were large and free refills , which i really appreciated .
i 've had amazing food and its not always expensive , usually not .
it was n't my favorite .
loads of onions , no tomato and no cucumber and no mint .
thai rama ding do n't go here .
this is not the place to go for thai food in phoenix .
the food was overpriced and bland .
do yourself a favor and skip this place .
stay away from thai rama if you do n't want to be disappointed .
he also stinks like cigarette smoke and talks way too much .
i called and called and no one answered .
had to go elsewhere and they got our order wrong .
guess i am ordering from somewhere else .
it was a royal blue cloth napkin wrapping a fork .
i felt like the chicken skewers were dry .
we looked at each other in silence and thought how really weird this was .
even still though , the pad thai tasted way better than my red curry .
but really strange experience .
i am not eager to come back .
that 's extremely rude .
food came out very salty and the portions were small .
bad business practices !
do n't bother coming here .
this restaurant should have stayed closed when that car drove into it .
in the meantime , a stream of takeout people came in and left .
regular customer just got denied service because they decided to close early .
none of the normal servers were there so i 'm wondering what happened ?
dined at thai rama tonight .
i was not told this when i presented my card .
bad business !
assorted vegetables & tofu in yellow curry .
not what i ordered .
instead of complaining about a tea we 'll simply take our business elsewhere .
thai e san here we come .
i do n't know if i 'll come back here customer service sucks .
i 'll stick to thai basil next time .
so rude .
i been here before it was great .
at that point i walked out because of the poor service .
i 'm never coming here again .
useless .
filed complaint with qt corporate office regarding this incident as well .
i do n't know what the other reviewers here are talking about .
they tried to play god .
nurses made one critical mistake after another .
but again , this was _num_ years ago .
does it really have _num_ come _num_ this ?
the nurse was in my room when i came back .
i told him that it had been over _num_ to _num_ minutes .
( remember i had to have the test within _num_ minutes . )
i will not go back here unless i have no other choice .
does it really have _num_ come _num_ this ?
!
and also saying can provide _num_ % discount right away !
i was wrong .
the hospital does n't care about people .
the drop in blood pressure was mom going into shock .
if she had received prompt treatment then she would have had a fighting chance .
try not to go to the er on a friday night .
they refused to do anything for her to make it more comfortable .
she ended up laying on the floor and the nurses allowed this .
i left feeling like i was neglected .
the fact that i was not taken seriously for this is insulting .
at that point , i told her i needed another nurse .
i wish i could give a higher review but i just ca n't .
they even called my boyfriend to let him know that surgery had started .
she had no bedside manor and was very rough with me .
i really just think she did n't want to do her job .
hopefully they can get better workers in their hospital before too long .
the first test ordered was a urine sample .
i waited in this room with other patients for at least _num_ hours .
no one bothered to see if i was okay or get my husband .
she was in such pain that she could not open her eyes or speak .
in my opinion dogs are treated better in vet clinics .
have been waiting for a room in recovery for over _num_ hours .
it has taken me _num_ years to write this review .
i entered er with severe back pain .
the church scenery is lovely but the staff here are poorly educated .
the rooms are n't even cleaned .
the sink looks like it has n't been wiped down in months .
the hospital needs to get a cleaning crew asap .
then their fees for services are insane .
wan na know why health care is so expensive ?
probably so places like this can give the doctors gold plated toilets .
avoid at all costs .
i would not recommend dignity health to anyone .
there 's not much we can do here .
i am so frustrated i ca n't stand it !
my last visit however not so much .
i dont get that i thought hospitals where to help people in pain ?
they did not admit her , into the hospital .
then spoke to a 2nd charge nurse who came on shift .
unfortunately it went south after that .
nothing offered to her the entire time , not even a cracker .
no she does not !
clueless .
she ate and we went to sleep the rest of that saturday .
i woke up around 6pm , she was still sleeping .
i went downstairs to get water bottles .
then the next thing she wanted was an mri .
maybe this should be called the va hospital .
this is a horrible hospital .
the staff does not care about the patients well being .
larry came down there and said we were not allowed to be there .
it was very unacceptable treatment .
whatever you do -- do not stay at this hospital !
she did n't even say that should would talk with her .
unfortunately i do not recommend them at all .
i would rather die at home then go back .
downright obnoxious and it should be against the law .
rant over .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
pa not called to see my arm .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
unfortunately , the nursing staff leaves much to be desired .
i wish my bad experiences were limited but that is not the case .
all while i was unable to breath .
my husband had to finally yell at the nurses that they were hurting me .
they then pulled the mask off of me .
not the actual surgery .
i would not take my plastic doll to that place .
they are horrible and have many complaints against them .
emergency room lacks compassion .
they definitely know how to make you feel worse when your sick .
dr ross is a bad doctor .
worst experience in my life .
they gave zero directions on how to get the wheelchair .
this was one of the worst medical care experiences i 've ever had .
once i left the hospital without the wheelchair there was no coverage available .
not after my er experience .
no way .
you reach out for help and you 're treated like a criminal .
may as well kill yourself , at least now we know better .
this place is horrible , dirty , unsanitary , and unprofessional .
this place is horrible .
horrible .
horrible .
bad customer service in emergency room .
black lady at the front desk does n't care about the patience .
this hospital is lacking in compassion and care .
however , i was never seen by the doctor on call .
were fine , until wednesday night .
the x-ray tech offered me two blankets .
the nurse suggested my husband return home and come back later that morning .
physician stated he was going to do in the morning .
he does n't know anything about me or my many medical conditions .
i do n't regularly have bad headaches , unless my blood pressure is high .
her concerns were ignored and she , as a person , was ignored .
we continued to be ignored as she was literally pushed out the door .
my mother never left the hospital again .
she passed away on march 8th , _num_ .
if you have alternatives - stay away from this place .
i went back to this hospital and it is very unorganized .
it was very unprofessional and against privacy .
there is zero patient privacy !
that 's all .
i had had a bad experience with this company , also .
she was one of the companies given to me also by state farm .
she then proceeded to not get back with me .
the other man did not ever get back with me .
it had lettuce and cheese on it , too .
so dull and bland .
the fried bread was too much and the green chile was totally lacking flavor .
it tastes like regular old carnival fry bread to me .
it 's yummy but not worth driving here for .
maybe i didnt look hard enough .
i wont say there 's no pride .
limited , unhealthy menu .
a tad bit worn both interior and exterior .
protein was tough and soup tasted run down .
not to mention that the bread was already deep fried .
taco itself was ground meat , refried bean , lettuce and cheese .
poor service since i was turned down for needing an extra set of utensils .
the beans are not very flavorful when they are whole .
it was like they just cooked the beef with no flavoring at all .
the fry bread house sounded amazing !
in an extremely offensive manner .
he offers my boyfriend fry bread with beans .
he comes back with fry bread sprinkled with shredded cheese !
it 's not melted or anything !
he also gives me about _num_ back .
of course , it was terrible food .
it was the worst experience i 've ever had at any establishment .
wo n't go back .
bland -- and nothing interesting .
not much flavor in the red chili .
sour cream .
the shit was disrespectful as hell .
i sat down and waited for my menudo .
my other spot does like _num_ times that for less money !
that ish did n't even taste good .
nothing too great about this place .
food was ok once we sent back the reheated food we first got .
wo n't be going back .
the service was so terrible i will not go back .
there was also someone who looked homeless cleaning off the tables .
the building is big , but is a mess inside and out .
$ _num_ for _num_ adults and a kid .
service is horrible .
the place smells like sewer back up so bad it makes you sick .
it is not worth the $ _num_ to go to this place .
i am just not sure why the great rating .
add in the environment and this is not a great place .
my boyfriend was diagnosed with ms about _num_ years ago .
i would suggest mayo clinic or finding literally any other option .
answer soon !
!
with written prescriptions that we already have at home and are not strong enough .
they are too busy to pay attention to you .
i 've had a horrible experience here .
they led me on for something like _num_ and a half months .
got no time for that !
what is wrong with healthcare in this city ?
i just do n't get it !
it has been a week and i have n't gotten a call back .
i have left multiple messages and still nothing .
this is unacceptable to have such poor communication !
so are we going to run out of the rx again ?
this is ridiculous .
we thought it would be the gold standard of care .
get yourself a personal fax machine if you plan care here .
unbelievable .
i had a horrible experience with them .
they just want to pass the buck to someone else .
shame on these people .
her concerns were ignored and she , as a person , was ignored .
we continued to be ignored as she was literally pushed out the door .
my mother never left the hospital again .
she passed away on march 8th , _num_ .
this place is horrible .
my doctor prescribed me the incorrect meds .
i tried for _num_ weeks to get them fixed .
i called , left messages , waited forever on hold .
i 've waited for _num_ minutes before getting tired and hanging up .
_num_ minutes ago .
the people at the reception desk are bored at best and rude at worst .
do n't expect to see the same doctor over and over again .
so someone else got to poke around up in there .
to track down my request ... she says they were sent .
a miserable front office .
ridiculous wait times , even when showing up early for a scheduled appointment .
but you can not see them !
i tried to use them as my primary care physician for the last year .
i wish i could give it _num_ stars .
unfortunately the staff is not so great .
no return calls , orders for procedures sent incorrectly or not at all .
i 'd much rather have someone call me to be honest .
back office needs to make a lot of changes because it 's a mess .
their front desk has been consistently horrible across that time .
it made me laugh out loud .
horrible place !
doctor 's are students and they absolutely have no clue about anything .
she prescribed me medicine that is not even available on the market .
ca n't believe they sell nazi items here .
Negative
i wish i could give this place a negative score .
apparently i 'm too nice .
wrong .
wrong !
i am too nice .
the manager was out and i waited on the call back .
now , they are trash .
expensive trash .
and that was the day that regal lost my family 's business .
extremely careless and are now not picking up their phone .
well i gave them a chance based on the rave reviews below .
my mistake .
i 'll not be going back .
it 's _num_ , what legit business only takes cash or checks ?
however , use this establishment at your own risk .
watch out - there has been a massive price increase .
it used to cost $ _num_ for both , but is now $ _num_ .
i get raising rates a bit , but almost _num_ % ?
i was so disappointed by my lunch at sacks today .
no greeting .
she took my order , no explanation .
not the best i 've ever had .
i ate half then turned to the bite sized cookie as my reward .
it was hard as a rock !
i do n't see any real reason to go back .
not spend money on a place where people do not appreciate it .
even if it is only $ _num_ i am spending .
this was my first visit .
it was a bit chilly so soup was in order .
the broth was very thin , not thick like clam chowder normally is .
it looked more like vegetable soup than any chowder i 've ever had .
counter service was simply unfriendly .
i was n't impressed , but i 'd like to like this place .
recently had lunch here while visiting the hospital across the street .
i followed the recommendation of my colleague and had the smoked salmon sandwich .
we 've only ordered from them twice , both times our order was wrong .
sandwiches are n't good enough to give them a third shot .
i really want to give them _num_ .
the atmosphere and decor leave much to be desired .
i will not be giving them a chance to do it a third time .
how do you mistake egg salad for turkey ?
we walked in , and were not even greeted .
we walked throughout the entire store with not one acknowledgement that we even existed .
needless to say , my money went elsewhere and will continue to do so .
the woman took the keys and then gave me a receipt .
she said somebody would call me the next day .
this was over _num_ hours ago and i have not received a phone call .
i got my car - thus _num_ stars rather than _num_ star .
very poor service .
required me to sign for prepaid gas when i did not want to .
manager said , that was a mistake .
has to be the worst hertz , i have ever been to .
return process was shorter wait and assumed it was over with .
_num_ days later i get a gold notice that my return was completed .
we to my surprise the added a $ _num_ charge for outside carwash .
that is the only positive thing i can say !
it is dirty and sketchy looking .
may i have the contact info for the manager ?
this company clearly is not interested in customer service .
i would never rent from hertz unless i absolutely have to again .
having no choice in the matter we ended up doing it .
i will not use hertz or this particular location again .
the clerk at the hertz office on indian school did not make this clear .
he made it sound as if total charges were $ _num_ .
all in all it took _num_ months to resolve the problem .
needless to say , i used hertz because i 'm a aaa member .
big mistake !
wo n't be using them again .
united health care does not pay your doctor so you have to !
in _num_ i was paying $ _num_ .
how frustrating is that !
of customer service needs to be fired immediately !
sharing a jacuzzi and patio with the homeless is gross .
just bs promises and nothing done to improve the total lack of security .
ca n't wait till our lease is up .
our patio cushions by clubhouse were stolen _num_ months ago and not replaced .
see my post for january _num_ , _num_ .
living here was the worst experience !
the management has been horrible .
um , hello , you did n't see i was on an auto payment ?
they did n't care .
security is awful .
people would come in the middle of the night and look through the trash .
since we 've moved out things have not gotten any better .
i believe they have new management now , so maybe things are better .
decided to look for a place nearby for my routine auto care .
no shades of grey and definitely more confident about fixing a problem .
sorry cactus , but i wo n't be coming back .
i happened to check my oil today and thank god i did .
only three things are possible .
_num_ .
oil leak _num_ .
oil burning _num_ .
so , i used to be a regular when i lived around the corner .
drinks have always been crazy cheap and they have _num_ for _num_ 's .
unfortunately the same dj .
ugh .
an hour and a half later , she goes to check on the songs .
he does n't have them ... .
yup karaoke all over the speakers .
dj can play any song requested .
never give her a bill larger than a _num_ .
worst employee ever !
why this employee is still there is beyond me .
so i went to this harkins for the first time recently .
i may stick to red box and my clean sofa at home !
someone stole my bike at this location .
( a big mistake ! )
sure enough my worst fear came true , and someone broke the combination lock .
needless to say , i was not impressed with this theatre .
they should at least put bike racks near the movie entrance .
bad karma happens to those who steal .
just try to buy your tickets an hour before the movie shows .
i could n't hear the movie the whole time .
i 've been to this theater several times because it is near my home .
i could avoid the crowd and noisy people .
there were _num_ people in the theater including myself .
i do n't have a solution but something needs to change at this theater .
then after a couple minutes a younger lady pops out in a black shirt .
horrible service .
lazy staff .
this is the worst theater in the harkins chain .
once again they gave tickets for the wrong showing time .
tonight is the last time i come to this location .
not thrilled .
do n't waste your time the way they wasted mine .
waste of _num_ dollars .
i was eager to get my acrylic nails to compliment my easter outfit .
well , what she did was no where near what i wanted .
then they hung up on me .
just hope the finished product is better than their not so courteous phone manner .
this place is not that good people .
it was disappointing .
not to mention she kept touching her nose .
no problem .
the entire parking lot smells of rotten garbage .
unappetizing , unsanitary , and disgusting .
_num_ ) the staff was incredible .
the price point is under the $ _num_ mark and the portions were large .
the egg rolls , spring rolls , noodle dishes , and meats were tasty .
in the end ... i do n't think i will be back .
sadly , i was disappointed .
not in this case .
i just was n't impressed .
like any other asian restaurant the wait staff , they speak limited english .
i was n't impressed with the restaurant dcor and cleanliness .
but i was very disappointed on my final bill .
that 's why i gave them a one star .
i have been going here for about _num_ years now .
one of the ladies here is super rude every time though .
it was take out , or i would of walked out of the restaurant .
so in good faith i tried to soak up the grease with napkins .
no mint .
oh dear .
very nice people but foul food .
rubbery tasteless spring rolls .
inedible vermicelli with egg rolls and grilled pork .
a mystery how rice vermicelli can be foul but they did it .
the `` vegetables '' were horrid bland tasteless .
even those few bites were enough to make us feel slightly ill .
the worst vietnamese restaurant in phoenix .
awful awful awful .
bad .
bad food .
do n't know why this place has four stars but it 's bad .
like you might get sick bad .
the ingredients are incredibly low quality and it tastes bad .
so rude .
the scheduling process is ridiculous and complicated .
so they really do n't give a crap .
well ... big time disappointment !
chicken was bland , and the rice & beans were average .
too bad oh soo sad .
get a clue , people !
bummer , it was a mix , and not great tequila .
mediocre .
mole has nearly _num_ ingredients in it so the flavors are usually complex .
this was just ... ... nothing .
not impressed .
the green corn tamales were actually decent but pass on the wet burrito .
the worst part for me was that the refried beans were extremely runny .
this place is alright but not the greatest .
their tacos are not authentic tacos in my opinion .
first bite , it taste like it was fried in fish grease .
the guacamole taste like frozen store quality .
so sad !
poor service and low quality food !
it 's thin and flat ?
never saw a flat catfish before .
not a lot of flavor .
but looks a little like a cafeteria .
it has no flavor whatsoever .
fish was over cooked , shrimp was bland .
everything was bland .
the fries were so old and so was the oil everything was cooked in .
the decor of the restaurant is run down and the staff is substandard .
even the soda did n't taste right .
of course , like all offices , they said both were excellent .
the place was jammed up with patients ; way too many .
i was on time , but had to wait _num_ minutes to get in .
they did n't have this at the other location .
that tiny bottle was going to be another $ _num_ .
hmm , i passed again ... for the third time now .
total waste of time and $ _num_ , but a lesson learned .
hmm , i never realized that four hundred something was an actual price .
they do a lot of advertising instead should spend more on training .
i just walked out .
he did n't receive his final paycheck after leaving .
i would caution anyone considering using this firm .
i would never support his business again .
the pho tastes more of msg than boiled beef bones .
and service is as bad as ever .
_num_ .
_num_ .
sorry , but i was really disappointed in this place .
it was very unappetizing .
this place is disgusting !
it 's dirty and the food is not worth it !
unfortunately everything is bad .
ick !
been here twice and they are rat infested !
needless to say we got up and left without eating our food .
too bad da vang was n't like that .
that is just completely wrong .
again , total disappointment .
made me want some enchiladas .
the first five things i pointed too was not available .
but i wo n't be back .
coming from la to visit phoenix , i wanted to try the local pho .
all i have to say was that this placed literally sucked .
the service was horrible .
second , the food that arrived was overcooked .
overall , if you want pho , try some other place .
i 'm sorry , but this place is sad !
maybe he had a long day , but that 's no excuse !
i do n't know why this place get _num_ stars .
it 's not even a _num_ star restaurant .
it 's in a sketchy strip mall and the restaurant is dirty .
oh this hurts .
da vang is not that place .
when i say that i 'm a vietnamese food nut i am not joking .
now for the bad .
the service was horrible and i will not be back .
horrible service and the building itself while old , should still be clean .
and only after we notified them twice did they acknowledge food was missing ?
terrible .
if you want cheap pho , but horrible dirty service ... come on in .
zero stars .
i dont recommend this place because of some very terrible customer service .
disappointing , disappointing , disappointing !
for the first time , i did n't finish a vietnamese sub .
finally , the steamed ground pork bun was a little off .
not sure how else to describe it .
however , today i was totally embarrassed bringing a friend to lunch there .
lost my appetite .
the food sucks .
my meal never showed up at da vang .
no apology , no empathy .
ugh .
_num_ people -- _num_ entrees ordered .
so , definitely a big zero for service .
the chicken pho was mediocre at best .
hubby said that on a scale of 1-10 , it was a _num_ .
really da vang ?
shame on you .
stir fried noodles with pork & shrimp .
sauteed beef with lemongrass over rice .
i guess i wo n't be going back ever again .
the food had some taste , but i would n't come here again .
theirs ... sucks .
ate here again just the other day .
for me like my blood pressure was going up .
i know that they are not the only restaurant that uses msg .
guess i 'm skipping lunch today .
the fish oil had no flavor .
the grilled pork was n't seasoned like it should and the vermicelli not good .
the staff was friendly and the food was okay .
the house fish sauce tasted like it came straight from the fish sauce bottle .
i was not thrilled to say the least !
gross !
eggrolls were greasy & the chicken was way overcooked .
if only zero star was available .
does anyone know good vietnamese restaurants in the valley ?
food was not good quality .
the food is cheap but still is n't worth getting sick .
foods great but english is n't .
_num_ times i ordered lemon grass beef with fried rice and got something else .
i got nothing helpful from them .
shame on it .
stop waste my time .
i just have _num_ minutes for my lunch .
i do n't have time to waste at all .
even before we saw the roach the food was disgusting .
please do not go to this location this is not sanitary .
they took our order and were out of my gf 's first choice .
there 's only one nice lady there of the bunch .
i 'm never going there again .
the place has always been slow on delivery .
Neutral
if i could rate this a negative number i would .
it was like a bad episode in real life .
as i sat down myself , i realized my chair was wet .
it def smelled bad and it was not water .
i walked them over and pointed at the cockroach .
the most horrible restaurant experience ever .
it took _num_ minutes after being seated to even be acknowledged by a server .
the pho was mediocre at best .
there was little flavor and tasted pretty bland overall .
the spring rolls were mediocre as well .
did n't taste fresh like they should have .
overall , this place has fallen off .
when we got there , service was horrible !
i lost my patience with the _num_ different people that came to our table .
none of them were on the same page .
they might as well call it extra big bowl of noodles .
it was ridiculous .
i had to get my usual grilled pork with vermicelli noodle bowl .
the pickled veggies were sad strings .
we left full but unsatisfied .
food is good ... service is horrible !
_num_ minutes for sandwiches ?
cashier lady is rude !
looks like a _num_ '' tv .
i am no designer , but this place is drab and needs decorating .
the wait was also about _num_ minutes to get in .
the place itself is dirty , crowded , and noisy .
staff was slow .
the location is n't the best location .
next time i crave chicken i 'd go to a different location .
horrible experience .
the speaker at the drive-thru does n't work .
so , after the _num_ minute wait we still have to place our order .
save yourself the time and headache go to kfc .
you get _num_ refill with that . ''
a drag show ?
are a bunch of idiots who do n't know what they 're doing .
horrible ... ... .
staff is unfriendly and rude .
if it 's all about money i will take my insurance money elsewhere .
this place has the worst and i mean worst customer service ever .
i wait and wait and wait no call ( they said they called ) !
( that does n't sound like it fit her own story .
why would n't you just change out the nose piece ? )
terrible experience .
gave my daughter the incorrect prescription for her vision problems .
their corporate office and how they will deny it .
very limited options .
no luck .
very disgusting .
the store was old and looked it , not very well kept .
i would hesitate to purchase any frozen items here .
something that would get an f if an inspection should happen by .
the prices were cheap but the product in certain areas is questionable .
went in around 2pm , had the # _num_ combo , teriyaki chicken bowl .
i would not recommend this place .
bad service !
than after a few seconds , she told me the bbq was better .
its disgusting !
might as well not wash your hands .
thats how bad it was to me .
the decor is dated and ugly .
my food is never all the way hot .
this place is very disorganized and i dread going in to renew my passport .
the last time was _num_ years ago .
sucks .
this will save you a trip and disappointment .
viva mexico .
this is the only place where you will hate being mexican .
customers .
oh yeah let me get right on it .
workers ... very rude & condescending !
i was recently in phoenix with my husband for business .
chris town ymca was the closest and i could visit _num_ times for free .
total body conditioning was listed !
it just was n't the experience i was expecting .
needless to say , i did not go back .
odd smell and in a sketchy part of town = no thanks !
terrible chemical smell .
horrible place .
really a drab smelly dreadful place !
last _num_ times i have n't been overly impressed with this place .
it does n't seem like a very friendly or welcoming environment personally .
sorry but customer service is lacking here .
the movie theaters used to be great but just are n't anymore .
miracle mile beat its retreat long ago , of course .
but this is not the mall where you want to slowly window shop .
i feel sorry for them .
there are also an assortment of booths that change every time i walk in .
but damn , am i addicted to their cafeteria food .
i would avoid this mall , drive the extra _num_ minutes to anywhere else .
how gross is that ?
i 'm not a costco shopper but i know most folks are .
it was dark , dingy , and overall a bit sketchy .
advice : if you 're a tourist , find a different mall to visit .
it 's not safe after dark !
i just stick to target , costco and the movie theater on the outside .
do n't bother going inside .
ick ick ick and ick .
the only reasons this mall still exists is because of walmart and target .
go here for the costco , the target , the harkins movie theater .
do yourself a favor and skip this mess !
oh , how the great have fallen .
tenants left , and so did patrons .
our family used to go there to a chinese restaurant for the orange chicken .
once mcdonalds moved out of the food court , that whole mall went downhill .
i remember they had a kiosk that sold gold jewelry .
i went to the kiosk where a mexican man was helping a mexican customer .
i walked off .
one store handles clothes and nothing is priced higher than _num_ dollars .
i do n't see myself ever going back .
within the last _num_ years has struggled to attract people to the mall .
not much to this mall .
i 'm giving the place two stars because it 's more depressing than dangerous .
how does that saying go `` fool me once , shame on you .
fool me twice , shame on me ? ''
it took me a minute to locate the emergency unit .
the waiting area was very small and dark .
overall , you can count all _num_ sticks between both arms .
that was n't gon na happen .
the room was dirty , trash on the floor .
i will not return to this hospital ever again .
went on a random bar hop one night , stumbled upon this place .
i was so hungry , i tried it anyways .
the rice is barely enough .
the worst part have got to be the service .
i would not go back because of the service .
methinks not , '' then one star it is .
i 'm not even sure what i got from here was food !
if it was n't fat , i have no clue what it was .
and i kind of feel sick just thinking about it .
also , the place is a filthy dive .
i just do n't care .
not recommended !
food was overcooked quite a bit and just not good .
the menu was somewhat generic .
the staff is extremely rude .
they 've definitely lost myself and my friends as customers .
even for cheap chinese the food was not good .
horrible !
what s waste of $ .
my boyfriends mongolian beef was also absolutely disgusting .
do not eat here .
worst pain ever !
friendly new ( younger personable ) staff but the food is garbage .
i ordered house chicken for pickup .
slow service .
few locations and limited online ability .
this does n't bother everyone , but i travel a lot .
there are plenty of better options .
do n't know why they even bother with a business line .
customer service was bad , they take forever to do one simple transaction .
why do n't you make more money ?
i will return to h & r block next year .
horrible horrible service !
he was rude and told that there was nothing wrong with my tires .
they were put on in _num_ !
also this location has no water in their fridge .
stock your water !
long story short , they took forever to order my tire .
unprofessional staff and lack of customer appreciation .
i find this so ridiculous .
the doctor is very very very old fashioned .
reduced hours for bowling !
too bad .
this location is terrible .
my whole family will never be coming back .
she was not loud , running around , chewing on anything , etc .
she was very rude and cold .
if your assistance 's are sick , they should stay home .
very disappointing .
wo n't be going back to that urgent care ever again .
my second well check was under _num_ minutes .
when asked about it , they stated that work had been done .
the reality of banfield ... well , it stinks .
and my brakes are at _num_ % ?
you are better off going to a `` regular '' vet for everything else .
total bill was to be $ _num_ .
a whole $ _num_ cheaper than banfield !
plus , i tried to call about it , never heard back .
i just am never going back .
i will never use banfield again .
i miss her terribly .
after i had had banfield for a year , i wanted to stop it .
so i just never went back and got other insurance on my own .
i changed my credit card so they could not do that .
if you want vet care , the shelter might give you better care .
for instance , my new dog had severely stained teeth when i got him .
none of these dogs are as smart as her .
lazy vet exam leads to poor quality care .
it 's ridiculous .
i wo n't be signing up for this again .
not helpful at all .
i have been very disappointed in this kfc .
my orders are consistently wrong .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
we gave them to a drive through customer instead .
oh crap .
they got virtually every order wrong the whole time we were here .
no exaggeration .
we did n't see any managers try to fix things .
this employee named jonathan was totally and utterly clueless .
avoid this dump .
every time , they have messed up my order .
tonight , i have had it .
i get home , and there are no extra biscuits .
worst place ever .
_num_ cars were in front of me and the inside part was closed .
then they got my order wrong .
really poor service .
overcharged $ _num_ in drive thru without explanation .
then no biscuit or cookie in the bag when i got home .
i am really let down .
i used to like kfc .
not anymore .
too many good places to choose from .
is n't this deceptive advertising ?
needless to say , i was n't too impressed with the food or service .
also , the mac and cheese had a weird flavor in it .
almost like it had been sitting for a while or something .
the mashed potatoes were n't very good either , very salty .
the chicken , while not terrible , was certainly nothing to write home about .
slow service and below average food for us at this kfc .
bought chicken for my family for dinner tonight .
they regularly get my order wrong .
i 'm partially to blame since i keep going back .
chicken not edible no sauces , butter , or honey offered .
took one bite and threw the whole meal away .
alone .
i ended up walking out empty handed .
it sent me to the camelback location where i got what i wanted .
very little service during the lunch hour as the staff looked very frustrated .
probably not a good move in that fast pace for _num_ bucks .
just cook it and serve it and avoid the problems .
so i went to the bar and just ordered .
maybe ill go back for karaoke if the food is good .
my major major pet peeve : _num_ for take out on the bill .
i am a fan of dives .
those places are why i use yelp in the first place .
my _num_ star rating has nothing to do with it 's atmosphere or clientele .
unfortunately for those restaurants , `` them 's the breaks . ''
and to make matters worse , they came to me burned .
it took our waitress _num_ minutes to greet us .
the flavor was completely missing and the beef was dry .
they also do not have cheese pints ( curds ) any longer .
fail .
my husband added cheese to his .
first of all , they forgot to put cheese on my husband 's burger .
i flagged the waitress down and told her about it .
second of all , these were the worst burgers we have ever had .
cooked to death , very dry and flavorless .
the cook came over to apologize for forgetting the cheese .
i told him they were overcooked and like shoe leather .
his excuse was that the grill got turned on too high .
he said he just turned it down so it should be fine now .
there were _num_ of us , _num_ adults and _num_ kids .
honestly , it was a disappointing trip .
and she failed .
it took almost _num_ minutes to get any food on our table .
again , empty drinks .
completely unacceptable .
the burgers were ok , not great .
the flavour was good , but mine was dry and really disappointing .
everyone else 's had the same problem .
i 've never seen so many over-cooked burgers in my life .
but at least the mini corn dogs were good !
beer battered and gooey , with tons of ranch .
and i do n't think i 'd recommend it to anyone either .
we waited _num_ minutes for our food .
needless to say , it was very disappointing .
why is this place deserving of such buzz ?
even the cheese did n't shine through .
but , i will not go back there ever again .
no more !
no potato salad ?
so in i walk .
tv is on , college basketball .
i just remember the server never did ask how i wanted the burger cooked .
_num_ minutes later , beer and burger arrives .
went for a bite .
bland .
there nearly no flavor at all .
half way through , i noticed the inside was really pink .
i 've went to places nearby for even cheaper that blew me away more .
then she kept asking everyone for cigarettes and starting strange conversations with disinterested patrons .
i hate those frozen steak fries !
beer price is ok .
the server was nice , but very slow .
and my cell phone still smells like the restaurant .
ick .
do n't eat here or eat at your own risk !
there is also no mention at their website .
ridiculous !
worst customer service i 've had golfing in the valley .
it is quite large , one of the largest i 've ever seen .
first thing i noticed is the selection sucks .
awesome store , especially to walk around in .
maybe it just exists in the two tanks that i did see .
in any case , there was no one available this past saturday to assist .
oh my god the salt tanks are terrible what the heck happened .
but this place is seriously the worst fish store in town !
do not buy from them there fish all look sick !
the people there suck bad !
Neutral
if i could leave a negative number of stars , i would .
i will never be back .
but as stated above , i simply think they do n't care .
i was willing to spend the money tonight .
i will not be back to the ocean floor ever .
now off on my _num_ mile drive back home .
i do n't know and do n't care .
i wo n't be back .
this is james , a former customer of ocean floor .
it was at least _num_ - _num_ grand going into your store .
i talked to dan as the manager on duty .
he let me know that the tank was tested and everything worked fine .
return policy is not great as well .
if fish is over _num_ $ that warranty does not apply .
weak sauce .
i 've been here probably _num_ times over _num_ years .
i feel like it 's slowly going downhill .
i went back a few days later and the rest suffered the same fate .
they wo n't special order fish quantities under _num_ .
horrible customer service !
worst ever !
the food was so bad we wound up throwing most of it away .
worst counter service i have ever received .
we got two ketchup _num_ salt _num_ peppers and three napkins .
she tossed it in the bag and walk away .
their hash browns were soggy ... .
we will never go back to this location when in town again !
not that good .
chicken really did n't have any flavor and if it did .
service sucked , still ca n't believe they want $ _num_ per hour .
not a good idea !
this is my go-to when i just need quick , cheap coffee .
i have no clue what 's going on over here .
it was confusing and a little gross .
it started _num_ minutes late and she ran through the program within _num_ minutes .
it was chaos and only _num_ kids were present .
then she dumped toys on the floor and left the room .
she did n't put any effort in creating a group event .
they are always out of most everything i am looking for .
( i ca n't really blame them though at least there is ac ) .
this one 's not for me .
i 'm sorry ; this place is just weird .
well , then , why is your open sign showing ?
it was , frankly , pretty disappointing .
there was n't a _num_ cause that would be what i would choose .
i purchased a setting and it went to be sized .
it came back with no balls and it still was too big .
i wore it _num_ weeks and one of the side stones fell out .
it took _num_ weeks to get it back .
then i had _num_ earrings one silver and _num_ gold .
she told me the jeweler my not be able to fix the silver .
i wo n't be going there again .
their attitude is terrible .
they could give a crap about anything there !
the only thing that was good were the pitas .
that was the worst $ _num_ salad i 've ever had .
there were two calamari salads , one with or without lettuce .
the not so good : the calamari salad .
this was not it .
since i really had n't eaten that much , i had room for dessert .
unless their specialty is chicken , as some other reviewers seem to be saying .
we had a very bad experience here recently .
my friend arrived separately and parked where the attendant told her to .
no one said anything to us about the car during lunch .
it was a very mediocre salad too !
the place is dirty , parking is rough .
i just dont understand all the reviews ... they are very misleading .
i would not take a date there .
i would not take a co-worker there .
i would not go there for a business lunch .
yuck ... dont waste your time .
two tomato slices and they were rotten !
no baklava .
i ended up just taking a caesar side salad btw .
i feel bad for anyone who goes there regularly .
sorry ... i wish i could have liked it .
love this place but recently i 've noticed it 's not been consistent .
did they hire a new cook to take over lunch hour ?
my usual salad was n't as fresh tasting .
i was hoping the experience would get better but he hardly came by .
rude !
had very bad experience .
wrong way to take of a situation .
loss of a regular customer not worth a ten dollar meal .
water was served ... after waiting what seemed like _num_ mins .
tonight was just the last strike for this location .
my friends soup and gyro were both cold when she got them .
they were not even that busy and service was horrible !
salad from a bag for _num_ bucks ?
if i come back here , i will definitely order something else .
i really would give this place zero stars if it was an option .
i ordered the calamari appetizer and it was a greasy soggy mess .
dinner was a gyro and fries .
the pita bread and the gyro meat was burned .
the gyro meat was really gross and made me sick .
been a loyal customer but sorry you may have just lost one .
i was told there was _num_ car in front of me .
i paid by money and walked outside to get the car .
would n't recommend this place if you want a quick oil change !
went in to get my radiator checked because it was leaking .
this should be a _num_ hour job and they charge for _num_ + .
i was not told how long it would be .
i was not asked if this would work for me today .
there was no consideration for me the patient .
i had another appointment scheduled _num_ minutes after this one .
ridiculous .
total time at pueblo family physicians _num_ hour _num_ minutes .
unacceptable , my time is valuable and the office staff did not respect it .
i am never greeted by the girls at the front .
unfortunately he only sees patients at this location one day a week .
excuse me ?
i 'm not a drug user and was being treated like one .
i 'm sorry , but this is my health we are talking about .
i said unacceptable and demanded dr. doug call me back .
i 've been coming here on and off for over _num_ years .
honestly worst doctors office ever !
wasted half my day in a freaking doctor office !
never going back !
was considering this office i am no longer interested .
i will never use the services at that facility again .
i would n't recommend this place .
receptionists are rude on the phone .
my nurse practitioner was rude .
( mrs. berry ) .
they pack people in wall to wall .
they do n't care about people , they should be shut down .
she refused to give us her name and kept hanging up on us .
that happen today july 30th _num_ at 4pm .
people are wall to wall in their and their need are not being met !
poor service .
receptionists are rude and incompetent .
i have never been treated so bad and with complete disrespect .
she has no business working with the public .
if that is not horrible customer service i dont know what is !
rude !
this pizza hut is a joke .
hell i may never order pizza hut again .
am i forced to give a single star ?
fire her because that 's not a good customer service .
my business is not going to freaking pizza hut anymore just because of her .
after more than an hour our pie was delivered and it was ... horrible !
no thanks !
instead she just cancelled my order all together .
she hung up on me and blamed me for it .
it 's been a long , long , long time .
tried it out again and still disappointed .
under cooked dough pizza with raw spinach on top .
gross .
the only good part was the crust .
yeah ... no .
i ordered one lone pizza and it took nearly two hours for my delivery .
ugh .
okay now i see for myself why the low stars .
there are better dry cleaning options in the area .
i got the worst headache and became physically sick after visiting this salon .
my experience here was horrible .
first time was the saturday before easter sunday .
i understand they were extremely busy because of easter .
anywho ... today was my 2nd visit .
i am normally a patient person if customer care is addressed .
this was a first for me to walk out on a business .
ciao !
the gel polish was all over our fingers & cuticles .
waste of time & money .
that 's not what i asked ... .
fortunately , i do n't have to use this place anymore .
it was painful .
in a firm tone , i repeated back to her the service i requested .
in my opinion , you get what you pay for from this establishment .
nail technician rude and did n't do a good job .
no gloves whatsoever .
today was the last time .
no detail , presentation , or taste .
some of my shrimp looked old .
i doubt i go back .
just a little warning for anybody about the shop at ace hardware .
compared to $ _num_ at a big box store .
overpriced , no customer service , weak selection .
this is why people shop at home depot .
dishonest , rude employees .
not a fan .
sadly this is where my doctor and insurance have me go for appointments .
service here is pretty bad .
these people were so rude !
i walked out .
everyone was extremely rude ... .
very poor service .
will not be eating here again .
disappointed , was really craving a mexican burrito .
average so a _num_ however the attitude is a _num_ .
we ordered the chicken quesadilla and was charged _num_ $ more than posted .
she said she could n't do anything and did n't credit the difference .
based on that they get a _num_ .
went to say something on friday and was treated like crap .
horrible service and horrible food .
will never waste my time or money there again .
but who knows no one really said .
it was lackluster and not very tasty .
the prices were a little steep for the food they gave .
$ _num_ dollar enchilada plates and $ _num_ dinner specials .
but all in all , i was n't knocked off my feet .
i has a bad experience here .
when i arrived to pick up the order the bill was $ _num_ .
after some time she returned with our drinks and started to take our order .
no guacamole , nothing .
after about _num_ minutes our food arrived so i again requested the guacamole .
i know homemade versus canned and these are canned .
the cheese crisp was really lacking and very oily .
the shredded beef taco had a lot of fat on the beef .
not so anymore .
much better food , and not from a can .
tried to voice my concern to owner who didnt care or wish to listen .
_num_ zero stars not recommended .
horrible .
as an appetizer , we ordered the spinach queso dip .
for dinner , we each ordered the shrimp fajitas and they were pretty terrible .
the shrimp itself was extremely rubbery and overcooked .
will not be back .
outdated decor and kind of musty smelling , but who cares .
gooey cheese and yummy sauce .
however , the shredded beef taco was very disappointing .
a tad dry but i 've had worse .
the fried taco shell was extremely tough and chewy .
i only got halfway through the taco before i gave up .
_num_ stars for the price and the taco .
_num_ stars for the enchilada .
they refuse to put green chile in enchiladas .
there 's too many other good places that want your business .
i went from twice a week to never !
arrived _num_ minutes before closing , and the door was locked .
went to the new location last night and was sadly disappointed .
same food , higher prices , poor layout and loud , loud , loud .
this is mexican food people and basic , mostly boring at that .
very rude management !
chicken and broccoli was eh .
i had sesame beef and house fried rice and i was not impressed .
i did n't know if it was beef , chicken or pork .
that 's pretty bad .
if my mother ever cooked like this i would have fired her .
`` my mother 's '' is bland as i am white .
the only item that saved my mother 's was the pie .
the green beans were without doubt , from a can .
i had been wanting to try this place since it is near by me .
the prime rib was a nice cut but dry and flavorless .
the salad bar is mediocre with basic items that were at least fresh .
i gave this restaurant several chances .
it was such a lie and a huge let down .
they sent us the wrong one .
we 've been disappointed with them twice now .
we like to support local restaurants , we wo n't be supporting this one .
i gave them a star because they delivered , that 's it .
horrible food at way inflated prices .
worst experience i 've had in a long time eating out .
ummm , just ordered delivery from here and the pizza is total crap !
it is crap !
tonight we ordered a `` chicago style deep dish '' pepperoni pizza .
over all the pizza was not a big hit .
the coconut filling was bland and almost doughy .
not worth it at all .
the mashed potatoes , gravy , roast turkey , chicken etc .
we even quit going for a while in hopes that it would get better .
very disappointed in the food & lack of response .
i was extremely disappointed in the quality of the food .
the sauce was eh .
i saw many glowing reviews on yelp & was looking forward to this meal .
i wish i just had cereal .
too small for anything !
they are over priced and the decor needs to be redone .
he is nice and fairly personable .
i 'd give it zero stars if i could .
this place sucks .
it reflects the ghetto area surrounding it .
customer service is pathetic .
it is mexican by a stretch of the meaning .
the orders are always wrong !
seriously , just keep driving , do not stop .
repeatedly the worst taco bell ever .
amazon is the better way to go .
i am very disappointed .
i trusted him that he would fix it like he said .
a week later i called and he was still not done .
be careful do n't be fooled by the friendliness .
as a child my uncle use to bring me a whataburger in new mexico .
not anymore !
o ... k , less fries and a larger drink are probably fine .
but i got a jalapeno and cheese burger and the cheese is n't melted .
being from texas , i 've had my share of whataburger .
this one is consistently horrible !
way too many other options out there to eat this crap .
worst whataburger i 've ever been to .
i was highly disappointed .
the food was cold .
i could only taste the onions and mustard on the burger .
now it 's just lame !
the _num_ star is for customer service because everyone is friendly .
so disappointing .
makes no sense .
i 'm a student at asu and my car was experiencing some problems .
i do not understand how this service center is getting _num_ star reviews .
this was literally the worst experience of my life .
apparently , it was an inconvenience to them to return calls to their customers .
it was very frustrating as you can imagine .
the car is having the same problems .
the only thing this shop is good at is taking money .
some of the worst food i 've had , period .
the whole order cost around $ _num_ with free delivery .
once i received my food , i was severely disappointed .
it was greasy and most of the food was cold .
so i put that aside for the egg drop soup .
the soup was yellow , thick , and cold .
almost left when i walked in .
was immediately disappointed .
food looked gross and not prepared properly .
still ate some and it did not taste right .
wish i could only give them _num_ star .
after that no one ate their food .
maybe just raising her voice would have helped .
dipping the shrimp into the sauce , making it a whole lot better .
the fried rice was good , typical of any fast food chinese place .
gross .
i took one bite and thought , no it could n't taste that bad .
so i took a second bite , yup - it is bad .
i wo n't be going back .
i would not recommend anybody eat here .
i tasted my side of home fries with onions and my single pancake .
`` it 's a little off .
the only good thing i ate was the eggs and bacon .
the hashbrowns were mushy inside like mashed potatoes .
the food was over priced too .
i would not recommend eating here .
no repeat visit here .
service was bad and took too long to get our food .
i still think she ripped me off .
obviously the _num_ star reviewers were not `` foodies '' !
i left a fat tip .
i ordered _num_ biscuit & gravy , scrambled eggs & hash browns .
denny 's ?
i would pass on this one , unless you were starving ... .
i had horrible service the first time .
no surprise there .
but pho bang takes shabby and runs with it .
the noodle bowl was ok too .
nothing to write home about .
i would say avoid this place at all cost .
i 'd been here about three years ago ... maybe under different management .
i 'll not be going back .
the only thing that i had here was banh mi .
there are too many waiters and not enough cook .
there were only _num_ cashiers on duty .
on a saturday at _num_ pm .
maybe she was having a bad day .
the lines at this ross are unreal and the service is nonexistent .
dirty , crowded , with unhappy employees working there .
even if its not ever customer , at least make an attempt .
at any rate , i do not believe i will be eating here again .
soda was flat .
cheese steak was alright not the greatest .
all in all would probably not come back again .
saturday morning 9:30 .
needless to say i have never returned .
i was looking for something quick & cheap for lunch today .
the pizza was n't bad , i 've definitely had worse .
the crazy bread was awesome .
hot and ready is a lie !
i promptly cancelled my order and took my business elsewhere .
avoid this place at all costs .
they are just as bad as a bank .
they told me it would take about _num_ business days and cost _num_ $ .
oh and the process takes 10-15 business days , not _num_ .
10am friday morning , no call from samantha .
so i talk to alex , another supervisor .
she is apparently busy and can not talk .
highly advise that you never do business with this crappy credit union .
once , i can understand , stuff happens .
do n't get me started with the service i have gotten recently .
the `` hospital '' staff is the worst .
he wanted proof that she was under _num_ months old .
this is for the groomers .
this was my first visit at this location and last .
i 'm disappointed .
the groomers seemed irritated and impatient .
i 'm just disappointed .
overpriced , usually broken , sometimes used wal-mart garbage .
i hate having to go here .
horrible service all around .
noticed had they bothered to complete the service to the front of my car .
as i told the area manager , that makes no sense .
the second time it took them _num_ minutes to get the car ready .
they seem to get their vehicles ready only after a customer requests it .
the employees are rude and slow , just the opposite of the luke people .
it has gone down hill in the last year or so .
do n't know how much lower it can go .
i would not recommend this place .
it was installed _num_ or _num_ weeks ago .
they were n't quite finished with everything when i had to leave for work .
the gate was installed crooked .
one side comes up about _num_ inches higher on one side .
_num_ weeks late to promised installation date .
this is not right .
over all the employees were lazy and rude .
we ordered our pizza with an estimated arrival time of 20-30 mins .
she basically threw my money back at me without a single word .
i know i 'm lame .
the food sucks .
drinks watered down .
dont even waste your time .
the bed room up stairs was awesome .
but the rest of the club leaves something to be desired .
i was supposed to meet up with some friends here tonight .
never have i felt like a fresh piece of meat like i did tonight .
this place obviously does not .
what the hell ?
not hot .
we go in , and suddenly every single guy in the club is there .
probably not going back .
never in my life have i ever felt sooo uncomfortable .
this place is rundown & i felt like i was in a meat market .
this place is gross !
updated establishment .
real disturbing , i do n't know why something like this exist .
we were very excited about this club at first .
we were very confused .
other than thinking , `` are you fucking serious ?
if i could give this location zero stars i would .
this is a horrific mcdonalds .
ya ca n't even get that right mcdonalds staff worker ? )
he sits out there on the curb holding a hose .
just wasting water in the desert and smoking .
how gross are you mcdonalds ?
i have quit going there and i live less than a mile away .
may be the worst mcdonald i ever been to .
wo n't be coming back for a while .
now how gross is that ?
i waited _num_ minutes and watched as _num_ more cars left the drive through .
because they would have had to wait too , you would think .
it did not let me rate zero stars which is to bad ... .
should n't the combo be a standard item ?
my first attempt i ordered the sandwich and nothing was mentioned .
no free one that day .
the product line is the same as every subway .
terrible bar .
not a single good beer .
no taps .
very sketchy .
would not recommend .
there 's something wrong with my dog 's eye .
they took my money ( $ _num_ ) and sent me on my way .
his eye is still in the same condition and i have $ _num_ less .
they just left us hanging .
most pet owners are responsible and pic up after there pet right then .
when i paid , i paid with my debit card .
she gave me back a card wrapped in the receipt .
i recently went to this location to find a shirt that i needed .
that should have been my first clue to turn around and leave .
but i needed to get that shirt .
unfortunately , i could not find the shirt i needed .
the staff was as helpful as possible .
suffice it to say i will not be going to this saver 's again .
everything else is very poor .
customer service poor .
adding on unnecessary charges not approved by me .
however , the customer service was horrendous .
i feel completely ripped off and will never be returning here .
i parked and walked all around trying to find someone who worked there .
looked like he could be a mechanic .
he looked annoyed and told me how my car needs a more expensive oil .
asked for clean towels ( twice ) and they were never delivered
this was the worst possible hotel experience ever !
no big deal , there should be other rooms available right ?
wrong !
i asked him to call the manager but he refused to do so .
there was also two other families behind me about to encounter the same problem .
well , i waited _num_ hours since and still no form .
avoid this place .
the staff here are extremely rude .
if i ran this place i 'd fire everyone .
price seems to be the only positive here .
the worst auto zone i have been to .
many of the employees do not know what they are doing .
go anywhere but here .
_num_ strikes you 're out !
!
waited _num_ minutes for a small pizza that never came .
do n't ever eat here the employees are racist .
had my first bad experience with this place tonight .
too bad .
awful place with poor customer service .
rude !
went to drive thru , smh .
horrible customer service .
the girl made a rude comment after i changed the size of my blizzard .
so rude !
she tries to hand me one more and i said i only ordered _num_ .
she argued with me and said she repeated the order .
she did n't say anything to me and just stared at the computer .
it 's horrible to think that people just want to be rude .
then stated that only a manager could do something like that .
which was worse than talking to the drive thru representative .
they are always long and slow .
walmart has faster lines and i hate walmart lines .
i had some tenants in my home who upon moving left some friends behind .
i called phoenix pest to get an estimate .
do not use this company .
you will get better rates and better service elsewhere .
i had some tenants in my home who upon moving left some friends behind .
i called phoenix pest to get an estimate .
do not use this company .
you will get better rates and better service elsewhere .
do not use this company !
they obviously are not organized and do n't care about customer service .
not sexy .
i 'm not sure why this place is rated so highly .
this place is trash .
except , of course , if i really wanted her to move on .
bad service bad dancers bad customer service .
this is the worst strip club in phoenix !
the fat ass manager insulted me he must of been on drugs though ?
the bartender was really pretty shitty drinks though .
i left and i will never go back .
was n't at all like i remembered .
was n't happy with this time .
it sucks , this place went down hill fast !
the place is run down considering how expensive everything is .
do n't waste your time or money .
rude staff .
scam -- no dancers and no refund !
as soon as we walked in , there was no one there .
no girls , no bartender , and no one in the dj booth .
this is a bad way to do business and a total rip off .
i would suggest staying far away from this place .
worst strip joint i have ever been to !
save your money and choose a better club that appreciates your business .
side dish wise , i was very disappointed .
i was mildly disappointed by the service each time i went .
the green beans and corn were overcooked and again not up to my expectations .
sorry big apple , you are no longer on my restaurant list .
was told this place was famous , but i do n't know why .
the waitress was n't too friendly .
all not bad , but not the excellent bbq i was hoping for .
probably a decent place to get food , but nothing out of the ordinary .
found most of the tables empty .
our food was very skimpy in portion for what they charge .
nothing special .
took too long for as slow as business was .
the gravy also was bland and looked and tasted like something from a bag .
the pancakes were fine , but nothing special .
the food is n't all that great .
my ribs were cold when they arrived .
i got sick that night .
i am giving one star because there 's no way to go any lower !
the zucchini app for the table was a-ok .
the salad dressings threw me off a bit .
no regular italian or balsamic vinaigrette - but a raspberry vinaigrette ?
not bad ... but i 'm not a fan of dessert flavored iceberg lettuce .
for entree , i chose the ribeye with baked potato .
the potato was fine .
but , no .
: ) in fact - my dog was n't even impressed . )
personally , i am not a fan , so i did n't enjoy them .
the decor is cowboy steakhouse .
the service here was good , but the food was bad .
just simply awful .
the server told me that my salad had no onions in it .
while i was eating my salad , i started tasting onions .
i 'm not just someone who wants to complain and get a free meal .
our server brought us two cups of tortilla soup with cheese sprinkled on top .
sorry bill johnson 's ... you just lost us .
would recommend to avoid this restaurant , there are better options .
the fries were soggy .
the service was mediocre at best .
so disappointed .
the only apple pie on the menu was for _num_ people for $ _num_ .
my beef brisket was mostly gristle covered by a heavy sauce .
unfortunately , that 's what the ribs were ... work .
the beer was perfectly cold but the ribs were forgettable .
in the last few years they have gone to hell in a hand basket .
they surely need a make over .
cheap .
is there big apple in it , i do n't know .
it was very bland and nothing that was impressive at all .
the ribs were the worst i have ever had !
the only thing my wife liked was the chicken .
sorry guys , but very disappointed .
i am not from the area .
all i know is my experience on this wednesday evening .
it would be hard for me to recommend this to anyone .
by looking at the measured portions they are struggling with portion costs .
usually not a good sign .
they were rock hard and dry .
my husband had been here before & loved the apple pie ala mode .
the bun was mediocre & it was served with packets of mayo .
did n't see that coming .
the thing is the service was so slow .
it took forever to just get the burgers .
then it took our server _num_ minutes to clear & get our pie order .
as for the steak , it was cooked to order and was n't awful .
the baked beans were pretty tasty .
i wish i had more than _num_ bites of them .
i wish i had more than _num_ bites of them .
the head of broccoli appeared to be steamed ... no sin .
the pulled pork was bland .
no smokey flavor in any of the pieces .
very disappointing experience .
i thought wrong .
wrong again .
this was n't one of those places .
i ended up being completely grossed out by my food .
my husband was not thrilled with the steak but he ate it .
grabbed my lettuce and tomato and thought wtf ?
the tomato was practically mush and the lettuce was wet and limp .
not surprised this place is closing soon .
shut the damn doors already !
i had a flavorless steak .
it needed spices and was really tough .
sorry bill johnson but i do n't think i will return .
after reading the reviews , we expected greatness .
thankfully beverages were finally delivered , but still no hello or smile .
those waitresses were very grumpy .
as for the food , possibly the worst bbq we 've ever eaten .
the cowboy philly had little meat and lots of peppers covered in tasteless gravy .
the bbq sandwich was just fair .
only eat here if you like grumpy service and sub-par food .
do n't waste your time going to the restaurant .
the chicken was cold , dry , and tough .
the ribs were over cooked and dry .
the iced tea was old and stale .
i 'm not happy its gone , but no wonder .
people were nice ... but wont be returning ... at least to this location .
they will shoot the shit with you all night if you let them .
because if that were my intention , i 'd ignore the sign anyway .
i 've shot there a few times but usually avoid it .
in _num_ years i have never had an accident .
what bugs me is that they do not follow their own rules .
either it 's safe or it 's not .
for a new shooter it may not be a bad place to start .
rent different guns to see what you shoot well .
they were rude on the phone and in person .
they were rude to a family member who called also .
i wo n't give these people a dime of my money .
ill never go back once i get my gun !
careless staff and they let anyone in .
i was without a shower until this was done .
this review is not for poor workmanship and quality .
i do n't know how this place stays in business .
they have really really tasteless burgers and everything is extremely greasy .
first the place is not called tony 's , it 's the burger shoppe !
asked for a small coke and a carne asada burrito .
it tasted like pure grease .
worst service and food i 've ever had .
it is a complete waste of money .
do not go here for piercings !
after my experience i was scared to go back to have them fixed .
when i say their customer service is terrible .
it is terrible !
if i could give this place a _num_ star rating , i would .
all of the employee 's there were not very personable at all .
i went _num_ more days .
the exact same thing happened , this time my tongue was extremely tender .
worst experience ever .
i 'm taking my business elsewhere .
$ _num_ loan turned into $ _num_ .
_num_ % + per month .
_num_ % per year .
seemed very nice on the phone .
then again , received no answer .
nothing as of yet -- very frustrated .
the gas at this station is not the problem here .
i paid for two car washes within two weeks $ _num_ each ... .
stopped here for a soda after a long afternoon of shopping .
i was n't very impressed with this location .
they only had _num_ bottle of the type i wanted .
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
i like to know the good and the bad .
but they need better trained staff .
all of their teachers are not certified .
they did n't try to resolve it .
well , they out right ignored me .
i wo n't be making a recommendation for this daycare to anyone .
this area is horrible and the office is disgusting and very unclean !
what a disappointment !
the crab puff had no filling .
the chicken was over cooked and had almost no flavor .
it was over cooked to the point it was difficult to chew .
the egg rolls were bland and tasted old and leather like .
horrible !
low quality food !
delivered to la quinta hotel .
it was all fat ... could n't chew it at all .
the egg drop soup tasted like hot water with green peas in it .
i would n't waste your money here .
so unprofessional and rude .
waste of time and gas .
breakfast was cold .
bathroom smelled bad .
service would change one tv and screw up _num_ others .
i would not recommend this place .
horrible service , mediocre food .
terrible food + terrible service .
food is not that great .
very expensive they charge for ice tea refill .
over priced ?
pour on it .
they are the worst agency ever .
they are worth nothing , so you get nothing .
she answers me , lying , `` no '' .
if i could give zero stars i would .
i made an appointment twice and they did n't show up twice .
do n't waste your time !
horrible practices .
no call .
no show .
talked to management and nothing was done !
my experiences are n't that great when i stop in at this place .
below average qt in my humble opinion .
on the bright side the soup was ok just not what i wanted .
he was just very rude about it .
i am unsure if i will come back to this store again .
ordered a chicken walnut that was ok and the cheese n beef was good .
one has a bad attitude .
she refused and blamed the company for short staffing her .
bad attitude .
i will not be back to this store location .
should i sleep in my car tonight ?
not even worth the call .
can i give zero stars ?
they did absolutely nothing to help me and failed totally at servicing my needs .
i would never ever recommend these guys .
i mean , it was n't bad , it just was n't great .
i may give it another try for dim sum .
disappointing .
would not go back again .
i did not go for the dim sum .
not a huge fan of dim sum .
it was busy the entire time we were there .
i went to try the walnut shrimp with mayonnaise .
some call it crystal shrimp others mayonnaise shrimp .
one of my fellow yelpers had mentioned it was her favorite here .
that just stopped me in my tracks and i could n't finish .
: ) i really wanted to like this place .
i will not be back .
portions are small and the rice is inedible and not very tasty .
the carts were few and far between .
nothing stood out as great or horrible .
so , take your chances and try their dim sums .
this place used to be good but now it is horrible .
really , food is bad and service was a zero .
maybe dim sum is still good but skip this place for dinner !
shrimp in lobster sauce .
pork slices .
service .
the worse service .
price was moderate , but service could use some work .
dim sum on a busy saturday .
unfortunately , this is my least favorite place .
the eggplant with the shrimp on top was old .
even the chinese broccoli was old and over sauced .
greasy and low quality .
too bad bc i used to love this place .
my family has been going here for at least _num_ or _num_ years now .
even when they 're busy , they do n't ignore customers .
really disappointing .
the dim sum was ok , but the selection and service were horrible .
from then on , it was always the same woman with the same items .
even then it took forever and the selection that was brought was poor .
i would not recommend this restaurant to any one .
there are other choices for dim sum in the valley .
if i had a choice , i would avoid this place .
do n't order their soups , its loaded with msg .
the service - bad !
i 've been to shanghai and i know this was neither authentic nor good !
the quality of food here was terrible .
the place is a dump and the line is _num_ minutes long .
well , it is the only dim sum place no ?
totally not worth the wait , especially since the food quality was terrible .
wow - yesterday 's meal was quite a disappointment to say the least .
just unbelievable .
i wo n't be making the trek back there again .
only giving them two stars instead of one because their flavors were good .
would 've been good had i not seen the fly .
very disappointed this time around .
service is very very poor !
mediocre dim sum if you 're from southern california .
i would n't bother .
the place was pretty busy at 9am .
the food did n't taste fresh to me .
but our experience here was not good during our last visit .
first , we were not acknowledged when we came in the door .
now the food was good , i have no complaints there .
prior to that , he wanted nothing to do with us .
no tip given .
the service ruined what was great food .
and that is really sad .
needless to say , we wo n't be coming back .
we order _num_ dishes but they brought out only four .
should i leave the tip for the service we had ?
waitstaff is extremely rude and can care less about you .
they do n't really speak english so ordering is virtually impossible .
worst place ever !
staff is so rude .
also some of there food are too oily .
the food was ok , ive had much better cheaper .
the service was the worst i have ever experienced .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
horrible customer service !
we did n't get our drinks until we were almost done with our food .
the dim sum was very greasy and soggy .
the guy at the front was rude not friendly at all .
i 've been to better places and treated better for less money .
i could have went to panda express and been happier .
they do n't burn noodles .
i went here for dim sum and it was pretty awesome !
i will not be eating here again .
they really had us for more than _num_ yrs .
a bit pricey but its the only dim sum i know near phx area .
poor quality dim sum .
all the server just standing there and hangout .
waited too long for okay kind of food & they messed up our order .
never coming back again ... .
waited _num_ min and barely saw any cart come around .
today was worst .
very rude attendant and no food available makes very unhappy customer .
the cart people always look unhappy .
if they do n't have anymore then why do n't they make it ?
it was only 1pm and dim sum ends at 3pm .
their bbq pork buns were barely filled with any pork .
what a disappointing experience .
i will never go to great wall again for dim sum .
so there is not much i can say here .
still no sauces .
in fact one girl i grab has no clue what sriracha even is .
i wo n't be going back .
service was poor .
food was underwhelming and too greasy .
did n't see the usual options offered at dim sum .
worst service ever !
the food is n't even that good .
service was meh , and the food was very inconsistent .
decor was lacking and it was very dark and dingy on the inside .
the only person who smile were the person whom gave us our seats .
this place feels very low budget .
my last visit here can only be described as subpar .
we were seated quickly but the tables were way too crowded .
pretty uncomfortable if you ask me .
also it is so loud here it 's hard to do anything except eat .
food is jus pretty bad .
if not that , it 's just way overpriced .
are you kidding me ?
it was just a matter of time before i fell for one .
this restaurant had the worst customer service .
the cashier was extremely disrespectful to us and was very unpleasant .
i highly do n't recommend wasting your time or money here .
i will never eat here again and i had a bad first experience .
the worst mexican food i have ever had in my entire life .
what the hell .
horrible !
went in and got no help for about thirty minutes .
then he charged me for _num_ hours of labor at $ _num_ .
they both burned me , never again .
very rude , short , and too cool for school .
no one ever offered to do anything to correct either of these two things .
never go to this just brakes .
the manager is very rude .
then all of a sudden some work was instantly more important than other work .
then he said he would through in bleeding my brakes for me .
the only good thing about this place were his other workers .
i 'm not too happy about that .
he did n't put the pads back on the car !
i called aaa and had the car towed back to my house .
the driver even stopped at autozone for me to buy some pads .
i ate there _num_ years ago and i got food poisoning .
well to sum up this visit ; the food was mostly cold .
the coffee was old and not very hot .
food is n't fully cooked .
my english muffin was hardly toasted .
just tasted like bread and butter .
as terrible as the food was , the service was nice .
our server was luis and he was very attentive .
the cooks just need to get it together .
terrible .
ordered a burger , and after an hour and a half still no food .
worst service ever and the manager was awful .
hash browns soggy with grease .
probably wo n't return .
this place has the absolute worst service ever .
the worst place i 've ever experienced .
Negative
i would give this place so many negative stars if i could .
this place is terrible .
the customer service stinks !
with a table of seven , everybody complained .
my pancakes tasted like fish .
fries were cold .
if i could give no stars i would .
so we tried this denny 's hoping to have a better experience .
10-15 minutes later they sat someone _num_ tables behind us .
i 'm so disappointed in denny 's .
the worst denny 's i 've ever been too !
do n't go here , drive the extra miles to a better location !
this was by far the worst experience that i 've had at this dennys .
i 've been here several times , but this time was bad .
i refused to eat it or send it back .
from there it just got worse .
redo was awful .
service was awful .
food came out cold and/or extremely greasy .
and around _num_ am the place was full of drunk college kids .
employees left it there for about _num_ minutes before cleaning it up .
the smell and the visual spoiled the majority of my party 's appetite .
but a reliable late night breakfast .
service at this restaurant is terrible .
so we stood there confused before we were finally led to our table .
our server threw the menus on the table and walked away .
then it was another _num_ minutes before our server took our order .
the meat was gross .
he says they were pretty good .
i 've had two bad experiences .
by far the worst experience i 've had at a denny 's .
by the time we received it , all _num_ of us received cold food .
pro : service friendliness is _num_ including concerned manager .
the food was horrible i feel like i was robbed .
wish they had a rating of minus cause thats where i would put them .
went for lunch today and never got my order .
i will not go back !
just avoid this place and save yourself some frustration !
another disappointing experience .
why can they make good al pastor tacos .
do n't even use real corn tortillas .
the only good thing was the horchata .
this past saturday i finally convince the hubs to go with me .
nothing current or that would even fly in a bath remodel these days .
and the pharmacist did n't even have a dang clue .
do not rent here under any circumstances .
seriously ; steer way clear of this place and tell your friends .
horrible !
shut this place down seriously !
flavor was n't too bad .
so it is take out or delivery only .
i would rate it _num_ stars , but the service was horrible .
the guy working the counter would n't honor the coupon .
if you have a coupon , do n't even think about it .
unfortunately , i found it to be so-so .
i tried a slice of the ultimate and it was very bland .
the canned toppings were rubbery and the sauce had no flavor .
the only thing this pizza had going for it was the crust .
i guess they are just to busy to be polite .
the second time was funny , why ?
personally i will not choose them for my second pregnancy .
so i rescheduled for an ultrasound the following week .
so now , i come back for my ultrasound .
this whole experience in _num_ appointments sucked .
and i refuse to have a horrible birth experience .
attended a drs appointment with my sister during the first week of march .
we wait about _num_ minutes before we get back there .
she comes back in and says blood pressure if great ?
it was not taken !
he quickly says he 's giving her antibiotics without running any test .
it 's over _num_ minutes late and i ordered _num_ hours ago .
less than stellar experience on this simple order .
worst pizza service i have ever had .
i waited _num_ hours for my one large pizza .
so they said wait _num_ more minutes .
again worst service and when they say _num_ hours be prepared for _num_ .
this place sucks .
but they made sure to charge me !
if there was anyway i could give this location zero stars i would .
she asked me for the address of my location .
once i gave her the address she told me i was incorrect .
this pizza hut is the worst !
do not order from this pizza hut take your business elsewhere !
worst customer service .
they didnt have a problem taking more money towards the deposit .
so they could n't guarantee anything .
the manager did not return my deposit .
with a two week notice , they should 've had this order right .
i finally walked out as a man and his son walked in .
horrible .
$ _num_ for two burnt , but delivered pizzas .
kinda like getting screwed in the drive-thru .
multiple times they got my order for a pasta bread bowl wrong .
overall , if you want pizza , order elsewhere .
they give you what they want to give you , not what you ordered .
i only come here because its the only one on my way to work .
these folks do n't have it together .
customer service is not great .
however , the information on their website is very misleading about the program .
i do n't like their bagels .
they 're small , bland , and too dense .
my favorite bagels are costco 's cheese bagels .
i 'm not going to lie .
the service is awful .
they all have personalities , but are n't obnoxious and wasting the owners money .
ridiculous .
made my order wrong and i failed to check it before i left .
went back the next day for a replacement and they got that wrong too .
coffee was _num_ hours old and only had enough for half a cup .
waited twenty minutes for someone to actually start replacing it .
not here , stay far away .
not worth a penny or second of your time .
these guys do n't seem to be able to keep staff or standards consistently .
the absolute worst part was the lack of sanitation .
gross !
do not waste your time .
lets just say the worst !
i was not impressed by the long wait to see a doctor .
_num_ more hours gone by , the doctor finally came .
they really need to take `` urgent '' out of their name .
the only plus is that they do friendly staffs .
surely they could be playing videos on healthy eating or something like that .
this place is the total opposite of urgent care .
i was here for _num_ hours before i saw a physician .
_num_ hour in the waiting room and another in the private room .
tony was rude to me and his employees when i was there .
they looked like they were old and greasy to be completely honest .
however , we could not continue to eat the fries .
maybe we just caught the manager on a bad night .
but that 's not my problem .
shame on you , manager and the north phoenix pizza hut .
do n't bother with this location if you want quality .
this place is just horrible .
ordered and were quoted a time _num_ minutes before we ever got our food .
he tried to tell me that the computer quoted me the wrong time .
dude come up with a better excuse .
he took no responsibility whatsoever .
it 's _num_ days later and no one has called .
were it possible to issue zero stars , i would .
slow , slow , slow !
when we got our order , they accidentally gave her chicken tacos .
i brought them back to the counter with the receipt and they apologized .
this time , they accidentally added mango instead of avocado .
_num_ stars because my burrito was pretty good .
awful pollo loco in phoenix .
the few times i have visited this location they always get my order wrong .
i order salad and they give me a different type of salad .
i have talked to managers in past and all they do is apologize .
i seriously hate coming to this location .
there 's better luck inside but never go through this drive thru .
it 's the worst service ever .
it was rubbery and gross .
oh yeah no worries , you just wasted two months of my time .
in summary , they are inefficient and not understanding .
i think i deserve an actual conversation over the phone .
i really wanted to think it through .
i was pretty disappointed .
i felt totally ignored and like my time had been wasted .
the food served was not the food discussed throughout the planning process .
unfortunately all other aspects of our experience left us wanting .
no one called me back .
i called again and this time i left a message with their answering service .
no one called me back .
stayed home from work to wait for them .
i had a scheduled appointment and they could n't make it ?
disappointed with their follow through .
waiting a week just to get another possible phone call is very unprofessional business .
do not use these guys if you want your trees to look beautiful .
after not hearing back from them , i sent an email requesting an estimate .
again , no reply .
this tasted like a boxed cake mix with frosting from the can .
very disappointing taste and quality .
the place did n't even smell yummy .
i was actually surprised by how terrible the experience was .
we sampled cupcakes to try different flavors and frosting .
we chose _num_ flavors to try , including chocolate .
frankly , i was insulted by her response .
i wanted a three tier cake and she insisted i could only have two .
it was dry and flavorless .
i know i could of made better cupcakes myself .
too bad i ca n't give it zero stars .
felt a bit unwelcoming there and i 'm not exactly sure why ?
sadly i felt it was a bit sub par .
i had high hopes , was a little disappointed .
flavor was just meh , did n't taste like a fancy champagne cupcake .
tasted like one you could get at the grocery store .
and i always find it hard to try cupcakes anywhere else .
the cupcakes just did n't stand out to me .
they way they packaged my half a dozen order was annoying though .
that probably does n't seem like it 's a big deal to you .
same thing with the packaging of these cupcakes .
the whole experience was eh .
i was shocked to see the same decorations on cakes and cupcakes .
i personally will be taking a hard pass on going here again .
i 'm confused .
i just left there with _num_ cupcakes as a treat for my daughter .
neither of us finished ours .
not worth the money , trip or calories .
worse than store bought .
small cheap place , narrow aisles .
poor customer service .
avoid at all costs .
you 've been warned .
it 's all made in the same factory in chicago or wherever it is .
i could not see the meat or salad .
i am not joking .
do n't eat here .
so sad , been going to this place regularly for the last _num_ years .
they 've lost this loyal customer .
super unhappy , and i did n't even eat !
first she said business was too slow to honor it .
then she said it was only for catering orders of _num_ or more .
then she said it was fake .
i refuse to do business with people that refuse to honor their promotion .
i have had two bad experiences .
do n't let the name of this place fool you .
wrong !
worst ever in all my years , please do n't waist your money .
imagine if this guy uses the bathroom and no soap ?
Neutral
and if i have a choice this place earns negative _num_ stars .
too harsh ?
enough to warn you to avoid getting food poisoning .
do n't think i will be coming back .
we really wish we only had a _num_ month lease .
the pool is n't always clean .
i am disappointed & looking forward to moving when our lease is up .
do n't make this your first choice .
it only got worse from there .
the maintenance is also a joke .
the management are so rude and not helpful .
worst apartment complex ever .
only gets _num_ star because there is no zero star option .
i would have moved sooner but could not afford to , unfortunately .
renovations of apartments in particular locations of the complex are receiving cosmetic cover ups .
management and maintenance are not at fault .
the fault is the corporation who owns the property .
please consider other options for your living arrangements .
the date is august _num_ , _num_ .
waited a week for the fixes so i could move in .
when i came back only the fridge was replaced and nothing else was fixed .
warning do not move here !
i would not suggest you spend your hard earned money on this place !
no wonder no one at the company will give you their last names .
horrible .
i received a call the following day and explained the situation to the agent .
i received no return phone call so i called back again .
horrible .
they are so rude .
there is no customer service .
i would n't recommend them to anyone .
she is just awful .
tried asking for a supervisor only to be transferred right back to robin .
rip-off !
these idiots charge $ _num_ to dry clean a shirt !
went there cause they were close by and what a mistake .
i 'm going back to my old cleaners .
_num_ shirts , _num_ pants at tower cleaners cost me $ _num_ .
this cleaners is horrific !
they will loose your clothes and not believe you , or take responsibility .
people like this do not belong in that kinda of business .
not consistent .
they made us wait _num_ minutes before taking our tables order .
after ordering , everything came out pretty quickly .
the food , i had the steak kabobs , was not hot .
not good .
see , just not consistent !
i would n't recommend this place .
not a chance .
oh ... .
the insurance person in the office is a complete liar .
you ca n't win with this office .
worst experience for the entire process .
please save yourself and avoid this place .
if i paid the balance remaining in full i should not owe a penny !
i will not , repeat will not visit this store after dark by myself .
hire a security officer already !
i just do n't get it ?
really no stars .
definately wo n't be filling prescriptions there !
pharmacy is always slow .
drive thru is not a quicker option .
i had to wait _num_ min just to get my rx dropped off .
speaker would immediately turn off , which meant i could n't even respond .
very rude .
i did not have a good experience at all .
i think i could have done a better job than they did .
will not use again !
she looked terrible .
was very disappointed , i saw all these great reviews and had high hopes .
this is the most disgusting mobile pet grooming company in the valley .
they are the last stop if your pet has been refused everywhere else .
it still looked terrible afterward .
i will not be going back .
you tried to use my private message against me , which was very unprofessional .
this time , i called and got an appointment _num_ weeks in advance .
now at the last minute , i need to try to find someone else .
very frustrating .
i had a hard time with my stomach .
it was later explained to me that it was the lens cutting smell .
then i was called into the exam room .
did n't introduce himself and was n't very friendly about it .
i thought , poor girl - this doctor is a jerk .
i called again _num_ days later , no glasses .
i called again on monday , october _num_ , _num_ .
i received no call back .
this practice is the worst in every possible way .
heard excuse after excuse and finally my glasses showed up .
that was the first bad situation .
needless to say , this entire process took over _num_ hours .
_num_ ) why ca n't the doctor call me ?
this is the worst experience i have ever had ordering glasses .
the office lied to me repeatedly , the lab did n't send them .
i went back three times and was told i was not cleaning them right .
the ridiculous thing is i did not even have them them yet .
this place is horrible in every way .
please do n't waste your time and money at this place .
i gave _num_ star because i had to give a star .
this business deserves zero stars .
front desk staff is also not very helpful .
free popcorn -- is that supposed to make my horrible experience better ?
this place is horrible in every way .
please do n't waste your time and money at this place .
house special friend rice : very , very dry .
the rice could easily be separated into individual pieces .
the beef , chicken , and shrimp were skimpy .
i only received a very small container of sweet & sour sauce .
others might like the sweeter , breaded sesame beef .
at $ _num_ ( not including tip ) it just was n't worth it .
my girlfriend and i where totally lied to by everyone we talked to .
do n't go to this crappy school .
it is not worth the money .
phoenix is much worse .
the teachers at this school do n't seem to care about truly helping students .
all in all , this school really sucks .
only missed a total of _num_ days , did n't actually miss them .
dont waste your time and money !
if you can afford ai , then you can afford another .
this place sucks .
its the worst apartments ever .
they also charge you for stupid things and charge a lot for them .
the water there is also so gross .
also , there was a dead cat in the pool area with kids around .
it was so gross .
do not rent from this place !
i have n't even moved in and already have experienced problems .
if i could give this place a _num_ rating i would .
customer service is horrible !
they did n't do shit .
the walls are so thin they still bark at each other day and night !
my stove was broken when i moved in .
why do they have a gate ?
the apartment rent is $ _num_ something .
it 's a shit hole .
other than that , i absolutely can not wait until my lease is up .
this place is loud , dirty , and outdated .
pet owners do n't really clean up after their pets .
the pool furniture is dirty , broken , and gross .
residents leave food and trash all over the parking lot .
others , are loud , annoying , and have no respect for anyone else .
it does n't help that your windows and walls are paper thin !
i would not recommend anyone to live here .

i would not recommend anyone to live here .
although the people in the office are nice nothing ever gets resolved .
called about _num_ times of a noise complaint at 2am and nothing was resolved .
or the maintenance staff has left for the day .
even that , it does n't help .
they walk in the streets and twice someone has gotten hit in the streets .
two times i had to fill out a police report .
warning : i 'm not a buffet person , nor will i ever be .
the freshly cooked pasta leave something to be desired .
at $ _num_ for a salad bar , i really would expect something more .
maybe it was an off day for them but the food was not good .
the salads were limp and obviously not fresh .
ill never eat at this location again , very very nasty !
the sourdough bread tastes stale .
so i had unfortunately left my phone behind when we left .
i made a mistake and left my phone !

i dont usually write reviews positive or negative , but this place was awful .
could n't even take more than one bite .
Neutral
the server was screaming why ?
why he could not wait a moment is a mystery .
but i talked to him '' .
confused , i asked before eating to refund me and i left .
they may have a more professional service teams .
salads were not fresh .
soups were bland , tasted like old dirty socks .
limited variety .
i would recommend not going here .
save yourself from being disappointed and do n't stop here .
no more .
horrible business .
after multiple visits and six months later , they have failed to refund this .
that 's not enough time to order a garage door opener ?
why does this place get _num_ stars ?
the food , even for diner food , was totally forgettable .
not everything is better with butter !
totally not the case .
the omelet is seriously fluffy , and quite large .
my first bite was not a pleasant one .
really , this is just meh to me .
the fact that i have to explain the difference is annoying enough .
that 's why i ordered an omelet .
the green chili omelet was ok .
the potatoes were not hot .
bad , bad , bad choice .
she totally made the same excuses about the server being new ( dude !
i do n't care !
i was very , very wrong .
if it was possible , i would give this business minus _num_ stars .
continental breakfast was good , but avoid the pool !
this is one of the worst we have stayed in .
not a very clean and comfortable hotel here .
i would not stay here again .
list too long to name .
wi-fi very slow and not reliable .
did n't have much options for the free breakfast .
i do n't know who 's lying .
no one knew who was going to clean our room .
went back downstairs to complain and they gave us another room .
the beds and pillows were really comfy .
the hotel is located next to a freeway in an industrial place .
i got lost a few times with the dead end streets .
our room was clean and the linens and towels were clean .
_num_ .
_num_ .
bathroom vent was filthy .
tile repair job in the bathroom was also shoddy .
_num_ .
wallpaper in room was peeling away from the wall in many locations .
_num_ .
_num_ .
refrigerator would not get cold .
_num_ .
she asked me of i wanted the sandwich with the just the chicken .
`` just the chicken ?
so i just leave .
these chicks are rude .
bad customer service !
my suggestion : spend _num_ or _num_ quiet minutes looking around before you order .
notice the floor , the decorations , the fake plants , the ceiling .
then decide if this is a place you want to eat food from .
only after ordering did i take in the grimy scene .
fries were overcooked , hardly any salt , and old tasting .
the service was uninspired and actually slow despite no other customers being there .
i wo n't be back .

overall it just could have been a better experience .
to be fair , we did n't eat there .
it was _num_ minutes til close .
however , their salad lacks substance and dressing blend .
even rice lack flavor .
i have had better ... much better greek food for that price .
not going back .
the meat was flavorless and really dry , the sauce just ok .
since that is the majority of a gyro it was really disappointing .
the price is not worth me trying this place again .
much better greek places out there .
sorry not impressed at all with your location at 19th ave and northern .
not going back sorry .
place is smokey as if the hood is not working .
fries too salty and the wait was too long .
but the soggy fries .
soggy gyro tho .
warning sign # _num_ : all white people dining there .
the three of us each had a different item from the lunch specials .
i want my $ _num_ back .
oh and my favorite ... '' do you want your check now or what ?
completely rude .
went there with my husband and _num_ kids .
now for our waitress , i hate when she serves us .
its alright but does n't have the real mexican food feeling to it .
bland , boring , cafeteria style food .
the beans tasted stale .
the machaca beef in the taco was dry and tasteless .
the rice has no flavor .
this is the worst place i have ever eaten at .
must be the gas prices cause the quality and portions have suffered .
_num_ small strips of steak for fajitas is sad .
the decor , still looks like they are stuck in the _num_ 's .
sadly , we will not be returning ever again .
the food was horrible !
the meat in the machaca burrito was crispy and burnt .
their rice , tastes like instant rice in the microwave smothered in tomato sauce .
sadly , we had really been looking forward to this visit .
this place is terrible .
never will i go there again .
this place is no where near mexican food .
my entire experience at this restaurant was horrible .
i see why this place is not busy .
wasted that money .
just had the worst mexican food ever !
the enchilada sauce tasted like it came from a can .
i 've been to the 7th ave location .
northern location not so great .
in a weak ( dare i say - nostalgia ? )
the `` hot sauce '' was not so hot , and not very tasty .
when it came , it was a soft taco on a flour tortilla .
not worth it to send it back .
the burro was stuffed with cheese & very bland chicken .
but i am not sure why .
the staff was friendly , though , i 'll give them that .
far cry from the 7th ave location .
when waiting for refills for drinks seemed to be a bother to our server .
this is by far the worst burger king i have ever been to .
probably the worst i 've ever been to !
was told by the cashier my $ _num_ was fake .
i was told no very rudely .
i in turn was rude .
that was _num_ days ago and no call .
service is slow -- very slow .
place is dirty .
counter employees act like they are doing you a favor by taking an order .
notice i did not say `` workers '' as that surely does not apply .
by the time the food arrives it is cold .
also the waiting room is turning into a mess .
it 's not worth the drive to me anymore .
this is our third and final bad experience with this dental office .
fees and services are not explained even when questions are asked .
if you want a friendly dentist , this is not the place for you .
the office manager is rude .
the front desk staff is not friendly .
i was handed another patients dental record in error .
there was an odd bad smelling dirty odor in the patient room .
the dentist is rough in his procedures .
this is probably due to the long wait .
this place stole my money !
roach problems that spread from other units .
friendly , yet extremely slow and inexperienced maintenance .
the management company had completely changed _num_ . )
once you 're a tenant the management could care less about you .
that was _num_ weeks ago and still nothing .
i do n't know , it looked pretty .
this `` first apartment '' experience started off rocky .
we get everything signed , all fees paid , ect .
to find out that our apartment is not ready for move in .
so we did and nothing important got fixed .
- the oven door did not close all the way , it still doesnt .
yes .
there is no way that _num_ people use over $ _num_ worth .
just not possible .
whatever you do , do n't move here .
they did email me a picture of it , however we never received it .
someone either took it off our door or it blew away .
the lack of professionalism and understanding is disgusting .
this has not been a good experience .
over the years they have had many management companies take over .
this most recent one is the worst yet .
yeah that happened to me at least _num_ times this last year .
do n't waste your time and money !
the cons : security : lacking .
noise levels : unbelievable .
they just keep saying `` he 's really busy '' ... .
this is the worst customer service that i have ever seen anywhere !
it 's ridiculous !
the worst staff ever !
will not be doing any business with them if i can help it .
horrible company .
terrible corporation .
greedy terrible company , seek other options .
i have never had such crappy insurance in my entire life !
wo n't be long before this place goes under .
hole in the wall does n't always mean good food .
tried the beef pho , hands down worst ive ever had .
beef stock from a can with buckets of pepper poured into it .
the meal i did get was horrible .
we assumed she was coming back with those , but she never came back .
she did n't apologize for not bringing all our food .
the bean sprouts were slimy , the lime was rotten .
if you value your health , stay the hell away from this place !
new place has better food , same cheap prices .
denied , because no one cares here .
before you know its week _num_ .
the burgers wet just okay ... nothing special .
the `` fries '' or as i know them wedges were not good .
then one day they changed to lower quality meat .
maybe they gave me the wrong patty , i dunno .
what a disappointment !
they refunded our order but it does n't justify what happened .
( wanted to give this zero stars but ca n't . )
my experience here was horrible !
fucking disgusting !
obviously they clearly do not clean up and maintenance the restaurant very well !
very disappointed in our recent trip to this location .
the burgers were bland and had no flavor .
i wish i had spent my _num_ bucks somewhere else .
i will never return here .
not here .
do n't bother !
met my husband for an early dinner after a work thing .
it looks like this place has n't changed since the day the built it .
unfortunately , that 's not how they came .
table _num_ needed to be cleaned , part of the table was sticky .
the food always seems cold .
i still find sonic only mildly appealing .
the burgers have zero flavor and are cold .
the frys are crap , the tots are ok .
there is also no answering machine when you call the location .
this `` business '' is a big hot mess .
crap everywhere .
no room to walk .
i could n't make it inside the door more than _num_ or _num_ feet .
ugh .
dropped off a fedex package and had to ask for a shipping receipt ?
neither party received their checks .
now there 's going to be a problem .
anyway , i never went back to that store .
this certainly is not tex-mex .
there 's no flavor to it except raw tomato .
the only thing that gave them _num_ stars was the service .
it was the most horrible mexican food i have ever put a fork to .
then my wife said her taco 's where bland and had a funny flavor .
the meal was pretty bad .
fajitas is just plain bad food .
my husband and i tried fajitas tonight for the first and were sorely displeased .
overall this was a poor experience .
if you are looking for good mexican food i would recommend valle luna .
aside from that , everything is average at best .
as mentioned by others , this is americanized mexican cuisine .
it was lousy and i would n't recommend it .
nothing fancy , certainly no frills .
so much potential , but it fails on almost everything .
it 's a true shame .
this time around ... the service was really lousy .
very disappointing .
then she apologized and walked away .
sad to say that we may likely not return in the future .
if i could rate service alone , i would give this place four stars .
ambiance is ok , clean but dated .
it is truly bland and tasteless , remarkably so .
update : i realized i had overrated it before .
it 's alright , but nothing special .
they start you off with chips and salsa .
do not go to this place and expect authentic mexican food .
he ate the flour tortillas , which were very thick and looked like pancakes .
bad service .
really really bad .
been there twice and i felt the same coming out both times .
mild sauce .
are n't veggie fajitas supposed to come with beans ?
this was not one of them .
the queso topping was watery and bland .
the food was decent , but prices were stupid expensive .
small sides of guacamole are $ _num_ .
horrible service and food .
this is not considered real mexican restaurant in my eyes .
was definitely a waste of money !
do n't waste your time .
chicken was bland no flavor .
the rice tasted like something out of a box minus the salt .
this all cost $ _num_ .
wo n't go back and wo n't recommend .
another on bites the dust .
visited fajitas again and was very disappointed .
they used to use huge shrimp .
restaurant was very clean and airy .
the red was ok , but i didnt say ole !
this place would not last _num_ days in scottsdale .
very unprofessional - will never go back .
you do n't get your bang for your buck .
the fajita pan was mostly onions .
disappointing .
plus you leave and your hair and clothes smell like the restaurant .
chicken was dry .
had n't been there in years and wo n't ever go back .
it was good but lacking alcohol .
the shrimp were very salty , the pork was not all that .
valle luna has a better fajita dish with beans and rice for less money .
today the shrimp was over cooked which really disappointed me .
they never skimp on the meals .
not in a good way .
the meat was tender , but cooked uneven .
not at all like tortillas i have experienced .
this should say steak and onions on a hot plate , not fajitas .
wo n't be back .
oh and the waste !
what a waste .
it tasted like a watered down crappy margarita .
i grew up coming here .
the first thing i noticed was the decor .
it literally has n't changed in the last _num_ _num_ years .
it 's completely outdated .
are you kidding me ?
it 's completely unacceptable .
there was barely enough food for one person let alone two .
a place that used to be beyond popular is now a place to avoid .
the teachers are rude and unprofessional .
the education is very poor .
after putting you through a mile of paperwork , you will never get paid .
this is the most unprofessional organization i have ever had to deal with .
complimentary breakfast was standard .
i do n't think i would recommend unless you had no other options .
he immediately snapped back that he was not buying bikes right now .
okay buddy , relax , i just asked .
there are used bikes in front , my bad dude !
i asked him about that , he said he could fix it .
no dice .
a little friendliness goes along way .
unlike others , i did not find the owner friendly .
you and your sad little bike shop in the ghetto failed .
they fixed my bike wheel so that i could ride again .
they were not great and i would n't recommend them to others .
unfortunately i did n't notice this until i got home .
outback steakhouse is alright .
my takeout took too long and they got the order wrong !
the restaurant was practically empty so expected a short wait .
but after _num_ minutes i asked about my order .
ridiculous !
one salad was obviously topped and one was not .
it took awhile to get this thru to him .
and why had my order been sitting awhile ?
no answer to that one .
no sorry for the inconvenience from him .
manager did offer me another salad though .
supposedly next time i visit outback will give me a free salad .
not good customer service .
we had a horrible experience several weeks ago .
no reply from email to their customer service .
what a disgrace all the way around .
this particular location wo n't be getting our business again unfortunately .
the service was extremely slow .
i took _num_ bites and could n't eat anymore .
hopefully no one else has the same experience as us !
the food was good but the experience was n't .
after an hour it was too annoying to stay .
went on tuesday and got food poisoning later that night .
never will go back .
the fish tacos were dry .
stop for lunch .
so gross , actually tasted rotten like rotten cheese .
when we smelled it we realized it was rotten .
service was slow .
took long for food long for drinks long for the check .
wo n't be back .
another restaurant added to the list of where not to have an enjoyable experience .
shame on the management .
waited ten minutes for a server to come and take our drink order .
several staff member walked by but none for us .
and they are still pushing that nasty all you can eat shrimp !
no thanks !
the service was very lacking .
it was a bit insulting .
after taking our order , we barely saw her again .
pretty disappointing experience for the price paid .
the service was awful !
at this location , we waited over _num_ minutes to get our food .
got to the hotel and they did n't even pack utensils for our food .
we 're not too impressed .
my wife has n't found anything she likes .
it was served well done ( no pink whatsoever ) .
try number _num_ was rare - blood red center .
i showed it too the waitress .
they seated my wife and i immediately and gave us brandon as our server .
i asked for ketchup and mustard and then another wait began .
anyway , not a good experience .
oh man !
i used to really like this place .
tonight i ordered a regular burger with swiss cheese ... .
then my beer came out ... with no orange .
he took my burger away ... with one bite eaten out of it .
sadly , we will probably not be back .
no special requests .
the total was $ _num_ .
thinking there was an error in the price , i called .
the location of the restaurant is , in a word , weird .
the biggest problem was the sushi rice , which was really , really vinegary .
to the point where i could n't hardly taste the fish .
oddly , i only noticed it with the nigiri pieces .
i went to sushi q for lunch the day before i left phoenix .
when we first walked in i noticed the place had a smell .
the server was kinda not nice .
i had the teriyaki chicken bowl with rice , and vegetable tempura .
sushi q is located in a strip mall next to a seedy liquor store .
there 's no need to beat the dinner rush here .
i sat at the bar and designated myself as an ayce customer .
_num_ orders = _num_ pieces .
apparently not the case in stingy arizona .
uni was not an option on the menu .
neither were any premium fish ( not even off the ayce menu ) .
the rice was served at room temperature as it should be .
the quality was disappointing even for a korean sushi chef .
the rolls were handled by a hispanic sushi chef .
the rainbow roll was standard , although the rice was a bit stiff .
ordered from the ayce menu and some of the salmon did not taste fresh .
any roll that had cream cheese was over filled with it .
that 's where the greatness ends .
went around dinner time , it was completely empty .
tempura was okay , but overall the fish seemed a little less than fresh .
in addition , the quality of their sushi was mediocre .
they did not get a single thing right with our order .
we waited over _num_ minutes for any sushi at all .
would not go back .
no fish .
i ca n't believe they have return customers .
for $ _num_ a person they give you nothing .
i do n't leave bad reviews but in still upset about this place .
i am disappointed .
the nigiri is not fresh at all .
the salmon and tuna actually smells a little stinky .
this is minor , but imagine doing cost control with miso soup !
our server lacked knowledge about the menu too .
nothing that we ordered particularly stood out to us .
plus , we felt really uncomfortable in the environment .
it was n't the warm and inviting ambiance that we were expecting .
overall , i was not impressed and probably wo n't return .
oh it was just awful .
this time was not like that .
cold food !
everything was bland and not quality .
food is gross , and not cooked well .
every order was wrong the food was awful .
short line this am , quickly seated .
potatoes are cooked to death and hard .
she seems offended by my attitude .
ca n't include my inside voice thoughts here .
went in for breakfast this morning and was seated right away .
the service was very poor .
the place was bought out by big corporation and they lost it .
i give the review _num_ star because that is the lowest option available .
i found this clinic as a drive by , advertising first visit free .
i went with our new dog , had her a total of _num_ days .
she was having problems with her eyes .
you could not get this at a normal pharmacy .
a month passed , dog still had problems and could possibly be pregnant .
it 's essentially panda express and the prices are reasonable .
the food tasted exactly as i would have expected , kind of bland .
two hours later i felt something , something dark and painful .
this stuff ripped my stomach up .
i 'd rather go to panda express .
i did n't even finish my food .
but if your looking for quality go elsewhere .
he also had a hard time making change when he rang up my order .
he was confused and tried to say something back to me .
if you want better chinese , go to panda express .
man ... never again .
restaurant is _num_ miles away .
just hung up before i could ask for pick up .
i call when im about _num_ to _num_ mins away .
walked in was n't to impressed .
looked at the food , looked like it had been sitting for a while .
would n't recommend it .
the restaurant is _num_ mins from my house .
it is now 9pm and i still have no food .
horrible service and will not order from here again .
i 've tried it about _num_ times and could n't see the appeal .
they refused to do it .
this is an old run down sheraton .
this is probably the worst sheraton property out there .
this sheraton is stuck in _num_ .
_num_ ) wireless internet is _num_ per device per room per day .
_num_ ) bathroom was stocked with one bar of soap .
also note : this hotel is not in a good part of town .
this is not one of them .
huh ?
bad form for service process .
no commitment to follow up to have the room problems addressed .
but nothing , absolutely nothing is as bad as the wifi .
in _num_ , they want $ _num_ per day for access to their wifi .
that is more than bad , it is offensive .
i could n't stay here again sharing a bed .
- tiny beds .
- heated pool ?
not so much .
called on a saturday and requested a refrigerator before sunday check in .
arrived past midnight on sunday , and guess what no refrigerator .
the air con is extremely spotty - not sure why .
the hotel staff really could n't care less how this property is run .
the sofa seems were coming apart and to me , that 's completely unacceptable .
i would have replaced that in my own home .
so it was not even cheap !
there was blood that was obviously not ours on the white comforter .
the next morning we woke up to shower and get ready for check out .
cause the previous room was soooo hot i could n't stand it .
rough stay at this place .
would not really ever want to go back .
do n't stay here .
seriously , find another place to stay .
this is really about the horrible service in the bar area .
ridiculous !
there was a hole in the ceiling above the shower with water damage also .
we stayed _num_ nights and only had hot water for one them .
thanks but i took care of it because my fiance is terrified of roaches .
this was a terrible , outdated , unfriendly hotel .
this hotel is very old and not well maintained .
for being a sheraton , we have experienced very poor service .
i went back to the lobby and was given a 2nd room .
not the best hotel .
i had booked a reservation with the sheraton back in late december .
i booked the reservation through a third party , living social .
the old reservation was cancelled and a new one was made .
she then informed me my reservations were cancelled .
the rate she gave me was $ _num_ for one night .
the room was dirty , and in much need of some tlc .
after the horrible costumer service and room not living up to what was promised .
the worst customer service i have ever received .
i did n't mind the old room so much .
i did mind the very low standard represented from the overall service experience .
unfortunately this is not one of them .
awful , place is dirty , all chairs have stains all over them .
food is awful .
seriously , if i had the choice to stay somewhere else , i would .
but it 's not .
it could 've been way better .
location : hotel was hard to find at first .
bathroom : the bathtub drain was clogged .
this place is a pit in the sketchy part of town .
marriott needs to check in on this place .
marriott should be embarrassed .
just finished a _num_ week stay here .
not true .
however , the worst is that my wedding ring went missing from my room .
staff and management treated me like i was lying when i reported it missing .
i would not recommend this hotel .
it is not up to marriott standards .
there was no room to put our stuff .
however , there are one or two items i have a strange liking for .
i took my boat there from the quote i received on the phone .
this took _num_ months to get them to fix .
third , the trailer tires all blew .
this left scratches on the sides of the boat .
wish i could give this one star .
i do n't even think that it was altered .
there goes $ _num_ and here goes my future business .
_num_ stars instead of _num_ because it was returned to me promptly .
food was served quickly and tasted fine .
here 's my problem .
no , really , i 'm not kidding !
the problem is the food is terrible .
the ribs are frankly , tasteless and the texture is strange .
the chicken is also tasteless although it was cooked well .
the only food that was somewhat okay was the sweet potatoes .
skip this place for any kind of meal .
on our vacation to phoenix we stopped by to eat here .
you can only imagine how gross was that for all of us .
no letter of apology for serving roaches on my vacation , nothing !
gross .
very slow service , obviously ordering ahead means nothing to them .
wo n't be coming to this location again .
i just do n't get that nice vibe from this specific location .
it 's sorta crammed in the end of a parking lot .
info online says they close at _num_ .
however with the doors locked and me on the outside looking in still hungry .
almost $ _num_ for one night ?
i would n't stay here again though .
front desk says too many people are on it .
the other _num_ reviews are 1-2 years old .
i only live _num_ miles from this hotel .
there is no living area and there are _num_ chairs at the kitchen counter .
i paid and drove around to my room .
i wish i drove around first .
i 've stayed at about _num_ hotels and have never felt unsafe .
this is suppose to have a fully equipped kitchen .
they said `` oh yeah , that 's the room missing the microwave '' .
just a bad hotel .
skip here .
there is free wifi , but no desk .
( the `` full kitchen '' did not include these basics ) .
phoenix , and no pool or spa ?
it 's like camping , only with stale air and clean showers .
do not stay here !
the carpet was gross !
this place was just all around disgusting .
it was the most disgusting thing i have ever seen .
then we got the hell out of there .
i told him , no i wanted a full refund .
she thanked me for the information about this place .
i stayed here for about _num_ month and i paid rent everyday on time .
as a result of that half of my belongings were stolen .
our tv did n't work and they said there was nothing they could do .
i did not feel safe here .
only the beans had flavor .
save your money and go to taco bell .
the food was tasty , but the service was atrocious .
( i 've had their chile relleno and was n't impressed by it . )
but no one refilled our drinks the whole time or checked on us .
the second time i came the service was horrible .
i was not impressed with the food .
they seem to put raw onions in everything , including the cheese enchiladas .
i will not be back !
the service is little to be desired .
i do not know how this restaurant stays in business with the horrible service .
we will not be back .
first we stood at the front for _num_ minutes waited to be seated .
no greeting , no be right there , completely ignored .
if that was the case i would 've ordered something else to begin with .
i did n't touch the rice .
after i finished my meal i asked about my tostada because that never appeared .
first he was disappointed because he did n't get a tortilla with his meal .
he did n't care for his meal .
he did eat some of my rice i did n't want .
all in all , it wo n't be some place i would be returning .
there were only _num_ other occupied tables in the place .
this place is not good .
i really have no idea how this place has a _num_ star rating .
the food just is n't very good .
i was left standing at the service bar .
now i 'm not recommending it to anyone because of terrible customer service .
embarrassed ?
quality of food was terrible !
waste of $ _num_ bucks spent .
atmosphere not good for dinner .
but very overpriced .
it was n't crowded at 1pm .
it 's probably never crowded .
i did n't get my mushroom , but got zucchini instead .
i did n't realize that they gave me zucchini until i took a bite .
the total of my combo was little over $ _num_ with tax .
my first visit last month was awesome .
the fries this time ... a disaster .
they were disgusting .
she just said pull ahead and she would give me new fries .
i got another basket of old , hard rocks .
we ordered steak subs , soda and split one order of fries .
i will probably never return !
she apologized for that explanation & that there was a problem with their vendor .
do n't eat this dirty food with terrible customer service .
was disgusted from pulling into the parking lot to walking out .
parking lot & outside appearance is dirty , run down looking .
as a non smoker walking into a tiny smoke filled restroom is the worst .
would have complained to the manager but had no idea who they were .
drinks station was filthy & did n't work properly .
fries were limp , bland , gross .
burger bun smelled like fish .
not like it would have done any good .
it 's really too bad .
just started working in the area and figured i 'd try it out .
would 've let it go , had my food been good .
even said , it 's just a toe .
yet i left each time not feeling he really cared .
sadly , the only real choice is la fitness .
the place just is n't that nice .
imagine walking into a house with stained furniture and a faint , unpleasant smell .
that 's how i feel every time i walk in .
smell and atmosphere aside this location is n't very busy during the lunch hours .
i do not like coming to this one .
customer service is poor .
prices are highly inflated .
however , their return policy is a joke .
i grab my debit card to pay .
bottom line , they lost a customer here .
awful , place full of flies , food is not good .
it is not clean !
they do not make good scrambled eggs .
the whole service was awful !
it was so horrible .
are you kidding me ?
_num_ ) lacks imagination .
staff was friendly until i brought up an error they made to their attention .
my only issue was the doctor wiped the equipment with a tissue .
so that grossed me out .
i spoke to my insurance and they said it should be $ _num_ .
not quite at a _num_ star .
feels rushed to get folks off .
so , they should clear that up as i guess things have changed .
the next time i came in he treated my wife and i very poorly .
this guy is the worst !
i am assuming that 's because no one goes more than once .
inside it looks like your neighborhood hole in the wall ; dark and dank .
i 've been wanting to check this bar out .
lack of professionalism , please hire a better and well educated individual .
plus no custard between crust n fruit !
threw the whole thing out !
i am so sad to say this is the worst customer service place ever .
i do not know why they were so cold .
i walked in smiling and made eye contact by nothing .
they greeted and welcomed my husband but not me ?
the only difference was is my husband is not hispanic .
i walked out and will not go there again .
i took pictures of the pool to them no response just a bill .
do not use this company for pool service .
not the highest quality selection for a second hand shop .
most of it was quite overpriced , probably waiting for half off day .
i prefer tokyo express for a chicken teriyaki bowl any day !
place was dingy inside , not very clean .
just gross all the way around .
not coming here again .
not worth it .
i felt bad for the one worker doing everything .
i only signed up for this so i can blast this company .
i only signed up for this so i can blast this company .
the owner is a tool who will not reason also .
do not waste your time or money with this company .
horrible customer service .
i regret not having the time to shop around .
complete rip off !
they completely scammed my _num_ year old mother .
could have gotten a new one installed for quite a bit less than that .
avoid !
stay away from smiley plumbing .
he said it was a _num_ hr charge which included _num_ min .
stay away from smiley plumbing .
the only one smiling is the owner all the way to the bank !
not effective .
just went in there to take my dogs out and get some food .
been coming here with all my dogs all my life .
we use the rude groomers and the nice vet .
it 's close to my house and never had a real problem .
today was very bad .
so i lost $ _num_ out of my pocket at the store .
my bad .
dogs still need to eat .
fucking rude !
if she did ask then that man would have given me back my money .
horrible customer service and the manager was worthless too .
i called to speak with the manager amanda who was unhelpful and rude .
i will no longer visit this location .
it 's a nightmare .
horrible beyond belief .
so i was a little pissed , but i did n't blow up .
and then as i was trying to check out there was a shift change .
do not go to this place !
i pay _num_ at the dealer .
that is a _num_ % increase over the dealer .
this place does not deserve any stars .
by far the worst jiffy lube i 've been to .
estimated time i was told for the service provided , _num_ minutes .
none of the employees seemed to know what was going on .
managers response when i asked what took down long , `` shit happens ! ''
they tried to see me everything .
i wo n't go back .
they tried to see me everything .
i wo n't go back .
no apologies .
whole process took _num_ hours .
do n't go to this place !
many of my items had spots that kind of looked like oil maybe .
instead , it probably happened in my closet and i did n't notice .
i give this place no stars .
slight false advertising .
i drove a long way , so no need to come back .
i really do n't know about their other services .
he was very unprofessional with how he was talking to me and another customer .
the technician admitted fault and promised to get it repaired .
they brought me a basket with one piece of chicken breast cut in half .
these apartments are a nightmare .
they are so unbelievably incompetent it 's ridiculous !
gate codes are never changed , so whats the point ?
do not rent with the turn apartments !
they are not safe , and poorly managed !
they did in fact cut down almost every tree in the entire complex .
haha what the hell is this .
fries were over salted the last _num_ times .
very disappointing for me because i generally love wendy 's .
if you can avoid the fries odds are the are extremely salty .
i ordered the chicken sandwich as i have done many times before .
this time , i got extremely ill after no less than _num_ minutes .
this rarely happens to me but feel the need to share .
typical , usually tasty , wendy 's old fashioned hamburgers food .
just turn around and find another place .
wo n't return here !
the fries were cold and undercooked .
the crispy chicken sandwich was dry and no extra dressing was applied as requested .
even the sprite seemed flat .
i would not go to this particular wendy 's again .
wendy 's is ok for fast food , just not this one !
avoid this taco bell at all cost .
do not give this place any business whatsoever .
they have some of the worst customer service i 've ever dealt with .
he is rude and does n't care about making the customer happy .
even as i spoke to the manager he was n't of any help .
he did n't care to take care of the situation and ignored me .
there were only two cars ahead of me in the drive-through .
it took me _num_ minutes to get to the speaker where i could order .
then an additional _num_ minutes to get to the first window to pay .
there were _num_ or _num_ cars behind me , by the way .
apparently corporate does n't read yelp , so i 'm calling them tomorrow !
all of the workers are incompetent .
this place is terrible .
never coming to this taco bell anymore .
the girl taking the orders was rude .
she rushed our order .
drive thru at this taco bell sucks !
i have been sitting her for _num_ min for only _num_ cars .
it seems like we have issues every single time we come to this location .
tonight we went inside because the drive thru was backed up .
we waited another _num_ minutes for our food .
it seems that someone in the drive thru had a very large order .
it is inconsiderate , but more so annoying .
it is a constant problem .
they just need to figure out a better system .
last time going there was a disappointment .
_num_ _num_ _num_ pieces of meat then move on to the condiments .
quite disappointing .
ordered a bacon ranch , no ranch on it .
frustrating .
by far the worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
this location is a disgrace to the marriott chain .
the hotel itself is very old and dirty .
the elevator doesnt look like it has ever been cleaned or vacuumed .
so not only is this place a dump but things disappear !
it is terrible !
sometimes you can not trust the brand name .
may as well stayed at a motel _num_ ... .
the building is very old .
this one really just was n't all that great of an experience .
super unorganized and incompetent staff makes this a very irritating situation .
the best she could say was `` i know it seems confusing '' lol .
to add injury to insult .
it was returned as promised _num_ hours later .
i 've filed bbb complaints against hertz with no reply .
i do n't understand some people 's work ethic .
do not buy appliances from here !
i just purchased a new dishwasher from home depot .
i immediately refused delivery and had to start the process again with a competitor .
this should n't be .
i should n't have to help myself at home depot .
hd still gets a couple stars because they 're not always this lame .
still , i have n't had a good experience at this location in awhile .
i sat around waiting , and waiting , and waiting at the flooring desk .
the 3rd party vendors used by this home depot are unreliable .
!
never will set foot in this place again .
hardly any beef , the veggies were all previously frozen .
the pork fried rice smelled like rotten fish .
about _num_ % time i get horrible rude service .
i will not be returning to this store .
i afternoon i was in with my girlfriend and i opened a tab .
drinks are cheap and he has free buffet of meatballs and beans .
they probably do n't know what that means .
false security !
the place has become bad news !
i waited ten minutes for someone to help me before i decided to leave .
next in walked another employee with a customer .
after _num_ min the gentlemen told me it 's done .
he said just _num_ .
as i drove away i noticed that my car shaking even worse .
the next day i noticed that my cap is missing on my ring .
i asked the guy and he answered : '' oh no one said anything ?
the manager is do n't even wan na come out and solve this problem .
horrible customer service at this discount tire .
i have been going to _num_ & arrowhead and frank r wright & scottsdale .
i have never been treated like this before !
this discount tire is a joke and i would never come back again !

this discount tire is a joke and i would never come back again !
the atmosphere was just pretty blah all around .
the flat screens above the bar are nice but thats about it .
fake friendly does n't cut it in the service industry .
they only have _num_ pool tables and their bathrooms are small and awkward .
day bartender is extremely rude !
no beer selection .
the total should have been $ _num_ , instead it was $ _num_ flat .
paid with a card & gave a $ _num_ tip .
i am contacting my bank tomorrow to get this corrected .
i hate to review based off a short visit .
ok cool .
there was _num_ guys at the bar and the bar tender .
do n't waste your time .
foods garbage and it took _num_ hours to get the food .
i ordered the carne asada tacos today , and man , it was horrid .
the meat was overcooked , dry and bland .
to sum it up , if you want pizza , go elsewhere .
if you want mexican food , go elsewhere .
now here is the deal , tonight i decided to pickup our order .
i drove by here a few times so i tried it out .
i walked in _num_ minutes after my phone order ( they said _num_ ) .
it was cold when i got home .
the kids dug in , but i had a turkey sandwich .
freaking nasty , overpriced , and incompetent staff .
not my favorite .
probably will not get again.
could n't even finish them .
ordered _num_ ate _num_ .
ridiculous ... like for real i was so hungry , never again .
sadly we will not be supporting this local business anymore .
very sad .
this place has some nasty food .
we got two burgers , one sub and one grilled chicken sandwich .
the bun was bigger than the chicken breast .
ever !
_num_ chicken avocado salads , that 's it !
every damn time i 'm missing avocado .
then when they mess up they do nothing to make the customer satisfied .
i would n't even give this place _num_ star !
i ended up throwing this place 's menu in the trash !
i called immediately and informed i needed to cancel the order .
they say you can not cancel , it is ready for pickup .
umm no , you , the restaurant , changed the time .
had a really bad experience .
i do n't want new food , just to let them know ... .
he says hold on and somebody else gets on the phone .
he says oh i know .
does n't offer anything ... says thanks for letting him know .
things happen but for real , no i 'm sorry ... no nothing ?
do n't bother !
are you kidding ?
well things have been slowly sliding downhill for the last couple years .
and , the owners are not very attentive anymore .
the portion size is hit or miss .
about _num_ % of the time i am very disappointed .
some part of the order is either wrong or not made properly .
all of the way across and _num_ layers on the bottom .
i kept hoping somewhere in there i was going to find some meat .
well there was very , very little .
and at over $ _num_ wet with guacamole .
but , it will be a long time before that happens again.
it 's bad enough the fountain drinks were two or more dollars !
i would not go back or recommend .
i wish i could give no stars .
i got horrible food poisoning from here .
terrible place !
horrible food !
this place is not clean inside and is a complete rip off !
do n't waste your time or money .
when we walked in , about a 1/2 dozen tables were occupied .
the lady at the counter was friendly and took our order w/ no problems .
the fire roasted salsa and the medium smooth were good , but nothing special .
the chips however , were well past their prime ( stale ) .
the red chile it self was very thin and watery .
the rice was bland .
the same bland rice and beans accompanied the tacos .
ive never been so frustrated since i can remember .
total was right around $ _num_ .
they are thin , crispy and pretty darn delicious .
i soon realized that these were horrible chips for nachos though .
they were too thin and broke apart way too easily .
i 'm not the biggest fan of nacho cheese on taco shop nachos .
the nacho cheese tasted ok though so it was n't nasty .
the chips were really a killer though .
the chicken they use is a little funky too .
it did n't have much flavor and was too `` wet '' .
i doubt i am coming back to try out any of their other offerings .
here are my problems .
my quesadilla had sour cream and guacamole on the inside when it was toasted .
overall , we will not be back .
ok , not the great fajitas lots of onions no meat .
tostadas are not that great ship tostadas i guess i was hungry .
did not like this place i 'm still hungry !
this was the worst mexican restaurant i 've ever eaten at .
i ordered the enchiladas and the corn tortillas were hard and no flavor .
they are thin , crispy and pretty darn delicious .

i doubt i am coming back to try out any of their other offerings .
smothered in enchilada sauce .
not sure who i spoke with , some supposed manager .
wrong !
that 's unprofessional and just plain stupid .
very ugly modern church .
terrible office management by same person that runs the children 's re .
very misleading , advertising $ _num_ and then changed the price .
the blankets were really thin .
our tom tom said it was a comfort inn but obviously not any more .
the wifi was spotty .
really bad and strong .
i was then given another room , which was indeed a smoke free room .
unbelievable !
oh and we can not forget the screaming children and baby !
when we walked in to our room , there were some problems .
do not recommend this hotel to anyone .
( no exaggeration ) .
the second night was even worse .
i would not recommend this hotel to anyone no matter what the price is .
the place was ok i guess but the staff was super rude .
we were running late and ran down to breakfast as we were checking out .
did i mention the room was still packed with people eating ?
not only that but apparently they have a little bee problem .
it was way over priced for the condition of the room and area .
Neutral
too bad there is no way to give negative stars .
this the worst hotel i have been at in _num_ years .
the bad : everything else .
our room was as poorly maintained as the elevator .
the sink had no drain plug .
one of the light bulbs above the sink was out .
the free breakfast was designed so the guests would not use it .
we could n't get in to the room on the second night .
they changed the lock so our key card would n't work .
i guess they figured no one would want to stay another night here .
we stayed because we had prepaid , and the hotels no refund policy .
this place is disgusting !
i 'm not sure if its a hotel or apartment .
people yelling going from room to room all night .
a guy was sitting out side of his room with blood on him !
the rooms are even worse !
buyer beware !
the pictures do not do this place justice at all .
i 'm sorry to say but it 's really really really bad !
i 'm not mad about it , it 's just the truth .
we stayed here just passing through for a night on a trip to sedona .
stayed for the price ( $ _num_ ) the front desk people were friendly .
i called , they switched us no problem .
second room better but that is not saying much .
she is _num_ .
i 'm sorry to leave a bad review but it is what it is .
dont ever rent there .
big mistake !
i will not return nor will i refer them for upholstery work .
spinach con queso was ok .
guacamole , rice and beans were pretty bland .
sorry _num_ stars here for drinks .
this location is not the best example of macayo 's .
got it corrected after _num_ minutes .
one check had _num_ beers but the keg blew on the third .
well its adding the entre remake that was taken off again .
the place was n't crowded which was nice .
although the portions were great they were very bland .
no kick from either chile .
even adding salt did n't help .
i was disappointed in the lunch .
they did n't listen to what i ordered .
this is the worst mexican restaurant !
horrible food , horrible service !
would not recommend this restaurant to anyone .
he never checked on us again .
he was just gone .
it was a very poor way to do business !
i wish i could give this place a better rating .
this place is a rip off just like almost every other second hand place .
but honestly , we 're still in a bad economy .
the service was bad .
he ignored me .
much to my surprise , it was very close to where i lived .
big mistake on my part .
overall i was n't very happy with my experience .
all five people working were complete morons tonight though .
i had _num_ that were not opened and _num_ that were .
they are not friendly .
do n't get me wrong with the two stars .
not sure why such high reviews .
other than the friendly girl at the front counter this was pretty mediocre .
pale tasteless tomato chunks , for example .
the interior of the restaurant is very dark , drab , and depressing .
it tastes like cardboard .
pretty disappointed with my visit this evening .
so i could wait another _num_ minutes ?
no thanks .
really good place to eat but really rude cashier .
she made things so difficult and was very unprofessional .
the pizza is okay and the wings are soggy and terrible .
this has happened to me _num_ different times over the past _num_ months .
why did n't i learn my lesson after the first time ?
even remodeled , it still looks dirty .
like _num_ days into the limited time promotion .
this is the worst mcdonald 's ever !
customer service is horrible .
then he was like fuck you guys get the fuck out of here .
my bf was so pissed off but i told him to just go .
it would have been faster to park and walk into the walmart mcdonald 's .
the worst mcdonalds in phoenix , this mcdonalds should be shut down and closed .
at all .
the worst mcdonalds in phoenix , this mcdonalds should be shut down and closed .
at all .
but let me tell you !
bad choice !
the fries were cold and stale , as usual .
she did n't offer to fix the problem nor did she car at all .
again , we are in the industry but this is completely unacceptable .
Negative
they deserve negative stars .
always normally come .
i 'm at walmart and decided to get a burger .
but it was so bad here i ca n't even do that .
what a rip off i recommend wendy s better price and taste !
worst mcdonalds ever .
i literally just sat in the drive through for _num_ minutes .
very slow service .
_num_ .
very poor service .
_num_ .
_num_ .
bathrooms are disgusting .
_num_ .
_num_ .
very slow drive thru .
_num_ .
do n't bother unless you like to torture yourself .
never have anything i order they always say they ran out .
so slow !
absolutely ridiculous !
avoid this location !
zero stars !
this particular jack just is horrible !
the store smells like urine .
girl behind the counter is helping prepare food after handling money .
the company should be embarrassed and afraid of making someone sick .
their employees hygiene is terrible .
disgusting .
disgusting food and terrible service .
in arizona this is consumer fraud !
avoid like the plague !
dining room a mess !
no coke in coke machine .
long wait time when i am only one in restaurant .
i was like ok must still be on the grill .
his offer fell super short of being satisfied .
make sure you have plenty of time to spare if you chose this location ...
if i could give it negative stars , i would .
it 's horrible !
besides the roaches , their playground and gym and everything else is always closed .
not to mention the management .
they were the biggest jerks we have ever had to deal with .
they never fixed our things in a timely matter nor did they care too .
very rude and ugly people .
i wish i could give no stars for this shitty place !
such as _num_ weeks long .
just save your money .
i wish i would have .
it would n't let me do no stars .
me and my girlfriend had problem after problem .
the people in the front office are so arrogant and unhelpful .
if you have kids i dont recommend you living here its not safe .
this property has switched hands for the 3rd time in _num_ yrs .
there were poop stations with waste baskets !
i do n't even live here and management pissed me off .
the property looks nothing like the photos .
do n't waste your time .
Very negative
would given negative rating .
worst management and worst apartment .
i do n't mind paying more for a burger if it is worth it .
disgusting .
mcdonalds _num_ cent burger is better than this stuff .
on a good note , the sandwiches some patrons had looked alot better .
too bad i wo n't go back again to try those out .
it came out to $ _num_ .
i ordered _num_ sandwiches and a fry not _num_ meals .
i would recommend find another place.
way overpriced and not worth it .
burger patties are thin thin thin .
only upside was the fries were good .
tables dirty .
still serving cold burgers .
cold burgers and fries .
waited for cc bill and it was indeed taken off .
he tried to offer me free food which is unacceptable .
this location is absolutely horrible .
the food is n't good .
neither of us could eat even half of our meals .
i got food poisoning and it is very upsetting .
my wife also is sick but not as bad as me .
we will not be going back to this place .
horrible !
there was a hell of a lot of drama between the employees , etc .
big mistake .
i asked her why and she said simply `` i saw a bug . ''
cockroaches are now added to our horrible experience .
ugh .
grilled chicken was tasty , & service was ok though .
my neighbors are so loud and obnoxious .
the cops are here every other weekend because they all fight with each other .
so i feel like i am living in a trailer park .
i have complained a few times , but nothing is ever done .
if i could give _num_ i would .
horrible experience from the start .
the place was not cleaned prior to us moving in .
i went through _num_ buckets of water just to clean the living room .
it was utterly disgusting .
now for the maintenance - i put in _num_ requests alone for the dishwasher .
most of the staff is rude and do n't have their facts straight .
one said i needed a picture of my pet , the next did n't .
they make money and you get sub par service here .
same price , better service , and a hell of a lot nicer .
horrible experience from the start .
the place was not cleaned prior to us moving in .
i went through _num_ buckets of water just to clean the living room .
it was utterly disgusting .
now for the maintenance - i put in _num_ requests alone for the dishwasher .
most of the staff is rude and do n't have their facts straight .
one said i needed a picture of my pet , the next did n't .
i am not prepared to move so suddenly .
tonight was the night i feel i 've reached my tipping point !
needless to say , we walked out .
here is where i have a problem .
annoyed at larry 's apparent need for lunch money .
i wait for my car to roll out .
ridiculous !
i 'm surprised he gave me _num_ for it .
unfortunately before i left i looked over the car checked for things .
first i could not open the gas cap .
so i had to go back the next day to get it fixed .
a few days later my battery is completely dead .
i then called that night and spoke with george b , a manager .
stress is not a word big enough .
tell me that if it was an original battery the .
but it 's the inconvenience that was a frustration .
he did not agree to this .
the next fry 's open was at 19th avenue and union hills .
there was no full service check out open .
only the u scan ones were open .
the _num_ for _num_ things we reviewed our receipt and something wasnt right .
the few vegetables available were limp and over cooked .
number one : disgusting bland food .
every single ( limited selection ) dish sucked !
the orange chicken tasted like old microwaved from freezer over sauced cardboard .
the onion rings were crap .
the egg rolls , crap .
the rice , which was clearly not white rice , was bland .
the desserts sucked as well .
also , the presentation of the food looked very sloppy .
ugly pink walls with horrible dollar store decorations .
weird smell .
on the plus side , its only $ _num_ .
but still not worth it .
i really hate to do this .
the buffet was pathetic and contained maybe _num_ items ( no white rice ) .
my sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre .
china garden has , hands down , the worst eggroll i 've eaten .
one guy at the cashier even commented that he 'd been coming since _num_ .
i do n't get it .
this is the worst restaurant i have ever dined at .
onion rings : looked like a brain .
i read the mixed reviews and decided to try it !
it looked like greasy grey colored meat balls ... .
worst place ever !
feel sick now .
gross !
the breakfast provided was mediocre .
i will not go back .
sadly we wo n't be back to manuel 's any time soon .
when the order arrived , it was screwed up .
i ate it anyway , but no offer to take it off the bill .
both portions were broth & veggies , no meatballs at all !
disgusting !
if i wanted reheated food i would have got a tv dinner for cheaper .
i have been here twice and really did n't enjoy the first trip .
i ordered a cheese crisp with chicken on it .
when my food arrived it was cold .
my mom 's cheese enchilada was n't cooked either .
the cheese was n't even remotely melted .
another _num_ minutes went by and she came back to get the card .
the only good thing i can say is the chips were good .
not worth the hassle .
$ _num_ for fajitas ?
the main issue is the terrible service .
the night crew here is terrible .
this is horrible mexican food period .
the meat is fatty with no flavor other than bland walmart tasting beef .
also , i did not receive everything i ordered .
this lack of excellence is what lead us to manuel 's on bell .
the bartenders are just so rude .
the older lady could possibly been the worst .
she just came across angry .
not good !
do n't waste your money here is not real mexican food.
i 'm wondering if they ate at one place and reviewed for another .
overall , the server was attentive and friendly throughout the evening .
please do n't get me started on the salsa .
it 's just ... no .
the green corn tamale made me sad inside .
the masa was gritty and dry .
i had really high hopes for this place , but it just fell flat .
i 'll make this short ... my family will not be returning .
the chips and salsa were good .
about the bill , $ _num_ .
not likely anytime in the near future .
the worst mexican restaurant i have ever eaten at yet .
the food taste was very disappointing , bland and cold .
i 'll go elsewhere next time .
no bueno !
it was just an all around bad experience .
needless to say , we walked out .
the restaurant has been remodeled , i like it .
the service , which was never an issue , was horrible !
ok , i wo n't blame the server , i blame the kitchen .
the food was mediocre .
the melted cheese on our loaded nachos tasted like cheese whiz from a jar .
although i found it weird i still tried it and it was definitely bad .
it had a very sour taste to it and smell .
i got a pedicure from here yesterday .
i was not happy .
i am not sure if they are using bad product or what .
basic cashier and customer service _num_ .
i personally handed this individual my card .
signed , on the corner of not so happy and not so healthy .
that day my wife just left , primarily due to the smell .
i 'd give less than _num_ star if i could .
i just went there tonight with my dad my brother , and his wife .
my dad , poor thing , ordered the fish tacos .
he did n't eat more than _num_ or _num_ bites .
my brother got the carne asada and his wife got the chicken chimichanga .
the rice and beans were just okay .
nothing special there either .
( and no sick feeling in your stomach either ! )
oh , by the way , we all had finished eating already .
i would rather have skipped that meal and gone right to bed .
do not really recommend to drive too far out of your way .
do n't waste your time or go out of your way .
i really do n't get the appeal of this place .
there is just not a whole lot of flavor .
beans bland .
rice bland .
al pastor was dry and boring .
the wife would never go back again .
not impressed .
small portions and i would say less than `` authentic '' tasting .
not friendly at all .
counter ordering and get your own drinks .
i would not recommend -- there are so many better places .
all the refried beans had a very strong sour taste like vinegar .
she went and talked to the owner and they threw the beans out .
by this time everyone was worried about getting sick .
the owner actually refunded our money and we left .
it might be that the beans were bad when we got them .
maybe a `` sorry about that '' would have been better .
i spent _num_ on this nasty place .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
i had chicken enchiladas and it was n't great .
the prices were average but considering how bland the food was , still overpriced .
i said ok ill try it .
first off i have to give them a _num_ for service .
no i mean no flavor in the el pastor .
this was horrible .
i mean really a bone !
fail !
not like this you wont .
you fail here and bad !
`` .
the tortilla was almost hard enough to drive nails .
rice and beans are so-so , not bad , not great .
thin and bland ; and again , that thick hard tortilla .
no complaints there .
my fish tacos were tasty although a bit bland .
numerous times our orders were wrong .
if you call to order , many times you wo n't get anyone answering .
their voicemail is n't even set up .
again , no voicemail was set up or anything to check and see .
yelpers should get out more ... if this is _num_ star fast mexican food .
pico de gallo was _num_ % onions and otherwise bland .
chips were not warm .
carne asada was more like hamburger crumbs .
wendy 's chili is much better meat quality .
tacos used soft tortillas and did n't see any cilantro or onions .
generally this was just average at best .
extremely disappointing .
food is n't as good as it was a year or so ago .
very disappointed with this place !
ordered a carnitas torta it was all bun lettuce and hardly any carnitas .
chips taste stale and salsa lacked flavor .
if you like bland mexican food this is your place .
i just was n't one of this people .
not good salsa , the beef chimichanga was very bland .
they said the wait time for our food was _num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes later , still no food .
an hour later , still no food .
not impressed .
episode of diners , drive ins and dives , so we were off .
and very limited inside seating .
service .
and salsa which came out quickly .
not good .

protect her fish taco 's admitted later they were n't good .
big time , mostly batter and just a mess .
still confused .
beyond rude !
my biggest complaint would be how dirty the kids play area was .
tried this place for the first time today and i will never go back .
i 'm used to a standard pedicure lasting about _num_ minutes to an hour .
this was rushed and the whole thing , start to finish was _num_ minutes .

wait is too long ... as usual .
no different than any other pharmacy .
sure wish i could give the pharmacy zero stars .
horrible customer service .
i said excuse me and of course he tried covering it up .
horrible horrible place .
which i never received .
i am so disappointed in this pharmacy .
they make walgreens have a horrible name .

about _num_ inches long and black or dark brown .
i 'm a red head , so it was not mine .
ick .
i was so grossed out i tossed everything left and took off .
i 'd rather wait a minute or two extra for a better quality meal .
she told me it was a gift and there was no charge .
after all of that it came out to $ _num_ with tip .
i just left .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
they dont want the money , someone else will i guess right ?
i am new to having my nails done so not sure this was normal .
she said oh i take care of that but she did n't .
she did a third fill over the top of the bad lifting .
i was disgusted and went to another shop and noticed a big difference .
i went back a few weeks later and asked for clear gel .
i called ahead to make sure the pizza i wanted was ready .
they advertise hot and ready pizza .
do n't be fooled .
only cheese pizza available .
_num_ minute wait .
only about taking your money .
if the see an opportunity beat believe there gon na take it .
charge you a pet fee when in fact you have no pets .
this is a place i feel needs a turn around in staff .
i had to wait several minutes for some one to check me out .
now , _num_ months later my battery died .
took that in and it had a _num_ battery , on a _num_ car .
it didnt matter , i guess a waffle house is a waffle house .
the egg 's were not cooked all the way .
i immediately pulled it back expecting to find food on the seat .
i walked out with my _num_ starving kids .
i live _num_ blocks away and i .
hit n miss , , , and this one should have missed ... .
so i thought she did n't hear me and asked her again .
so we left and i hear the waitress say she was rude .
well rude staff .
nothing to write home about .
the waffles were lame .
the waitress was friendly but never came back to offer more coffee .
floors are dirty .
very disappointed .
first thing i noticed was two employees eating a waffle off the same plate .
the kitchen floor was filthy with food all over the floor near the grill .
the employees just walked through it .
we walked in and put our name in for two .
when i asked her nicely about it she did n't know what to say .
i 'd pass on this one , unless you are desperate .
no tv hook ups and very slow internet connection .
we stayed here back in april .
it was very dirty ( esp the carpet ) and in poor condition .
the beds were very uncomfortable ( cheap mattresses ) .
the bathroom was even worse , it was dingy .
if i could give zero stars i would .
the lady at the front was very rude and not helpful at all .
when we got to the room our key would n't work .
we wo n't be staying at any days inn ever again .
would have been better off sleeping on the streets than in this .
bathroom door would not stay closed or lock .
blow dryer didnt work .
i checked in and one thirty minutes later i checked out .
it was so horrid my gf and i broke the lease .
leasing office did not want anything to do with it and wouldnt get involved .
the maintenance crew there leaves much than do be desired .
i feel sorry for anyone who moves in here .
but do n't take my word for it .
customer service period .
this place is a joke & the staff is very unprofessional !
i would have given it _num_ starts if i could .
are you sure the a/c is n't working ?
this is just my experience over the last _num_ years .
just a few more months of this nonsense .
either they are dishonest , incompetent or both .
this place is a nightmare .
ca n't even let my kids play outside .
they have a very poor servicing .
then they did n't open until we pretty much had everything moved in already .
not friendly at all .
number two your prices are already expensive you ca n't discount that for us ?
denise , your form letter does not fit the situation .
the staff in the office does n't care about anything .
there has been multiple break ins into vehicles even one stolen from the lot .
this guy beat the living hell out of my head .
worst haircut i 've ever gotten .
terrible fade and terrible barber .
noisy , awful place .
i 've had bad neighbors and bad service from the office women .
thank god my lease is up soon , anything is better than this .
( see photos ) they also occasionally let people in with their pets .
this is the worst costco location in the entire valley .
produce is rotten .
mushy baby cucumbers very few cashiers open .
huge disappointment .
it varies from annoying to just a total zoo .
this location is near my house , visit here frequently for years .
would have been _num_ but the eye exam receptionist was rude and tacky .
so i went to another doctor .
she said my balance was $ _num_ .
she replied that the insurance was paying $ _num_ .
the most i should of paid was $ _num_ .
no offer to contact the insurance company or have someone else look at it .
i left called my insurance company .
my insurance company told them that i should only pay $ _num_ .
they said no that is not what our system is .
so i am going somewhere else .
i went to this location to get hot pizza and a hot dog .
she stopped me at the front , asked for my costco card .
they way she asked was not polite at all !
all in all , i just felt horrible , and sad for that lady .
and other future costco potential customers .
dr kelly cross & associates optometrist .
this now is almost _num_ minutes later .
needless they have lost a customer due to this fragrant lack of service .
horrible .
btw , this is the only costco location that requires this in the area .
and spent the whole time rolling her eyes .
wow , telling your customers they are wrong and with an attitude .
awful !
these people should n't even be in business .
will not use them again .
terrible .
had more excuses as to why they did n't show up .
with safeway it seems really hit or miss .
they are extremely dry with hardly any meat on them at all .
they 're always soggy an barley cooked all the way .
all were painfully mediocre .
big mistake .
it was bad .
do n't bother .
even pizza hut is better which is saying a lot .
also $ _num_ .
for _num_ pizza and wings .
so i hardly ever order delivery .
she was beyond annoyed with me .
then gave me that `` you 're wasting my time '' attitude .
what the hell ?
... yeah it was that bad .
no exaggeration needed .
their customer service is the worst if they made your meal wrong .
obviously she just does n't care !
is n't it ?
i am a pizza lover - nothing like dough and cheese with great sauce !
the sauce was gross tasted like salsa without the heat .
the cheese was rubbery and not tasty @ all .
while the wings are okay , the pizza is really sub par .
do n't order thin crust , they have no idea what they are doing .
most times it 's overcooked and the dough is n't right for thin crust .
i 'm extremely disappointed .
hope nobody likes dressing ?
the veterinarian prescribed antibiotics .
still ... _num_ days goes by and he still has not eaten .
she was not very friendly to start with and smelled strongly of cigarettes .
will not be coming back to this petsmart grooming salon .
jenny ruined it for me .
i would not let her handle my dog .
in addition to the quality of the homes they are extremely rude and disrespectful .
it 's too often down .
this time was too much .
i was not help by bob .
very rude .
thanks bob you really made sure to ruin my experience .
just had my first visit here .
i left without being helped and cash still in my pocket .
i wo n't be back as this store has a serious management problem .
he is a very unprofessional person and really should not be in customer service .
try the local arizona company online called gallery of guns .
the customer service sucks .
i got my eye tested on august _num_ , _num_ .
i got my glasses online from another place in september _num_ , _num_ .
i do n't think i 'll recommend this place or ever go back .
they are very very rude like they are doing you a favor .
worst time ever and arguing with customers in front of other customers as well .
do you guys just hire anyone off the streets ?
do not i repeat do not go to this company !
there was no checking to see how they fit or anything .
not sure how many more chances i should give this office .
the person who answered the phone was rude .
i said no thank you .
i think you should check the rest of your food for bugs .
oh my god this place is gross !
_num_ drinks .
_num_ drinks followed , with one straw ( boo ) .
_num_ of them wrong , and no straw .
but first bite in , it was packed with tomatoes .
i do n't understand what is so hard about not putting tomatoes .
not affiliated , and not a parent or student , merely a neighbor .
the staff was alright , but the experience was strange .
they would n't take `` no '' for an answer .
we recently hired pour masters for my wedding .
are you kidding me ?
so here are the things that went wrong .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
and for all _num_ it was _num_ .
they absolutely were not there previous to dropping my truck off .
i went back and was told basically it was not there problem .
first off , this place is a dive , and i mean a dive .
i actually regret it .
the onions overpowered the green chili which was a major problem .
the fries tasted like they were frozen in a bag then fried .
seriously ?
no more all you can eat catfish !
_num_ $ for two meals and two beers seems pretty steep .
all in all i 'll just say cleanliness goes a long way .
i did n't feel welcome here after some new advertising on yelp .
there was no manager to be found .
we went on a saturday night about 6:30pm and it was very slow .
i 've been coming to the q since i was _num_ years old .
i was looking forward to sharing my history with our waitress .
my number one pet peeve is hot food coming out cold .
you do n't charge people extra because your food when out cold !
strike _num_ !
it was all her fault my experience sucked .
i 've never met a server so bitter and rude before .
this chick was not happy getting $ _num_ on a $ _num_ tab .
ca n't stand that .
go to luke 's of chicago , get the combo .
i have an hour lunch so i get in my car and drive .
the `` combo '' was a little over $ _num_ .
it was just alright .
not nasty , but not delicious either .
they fry them fresh but that does n't make them good .
i 'd skip them if there is ever a `` next time '' .
overall , it was just an ok lunch .
very disappointed !
the ultimate fries with ranch are gross !
the sandwich was tasteless and the bread was not very good .
they really skimp out on the meat and cheese .
the ultimate fries with cheese and bacon tastes kind of bland .
probably , until i find another better philly joint .
Positive
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
they informed that they had the parents , but not the driver .
if and only if i can put _num_ star .
worst customer service ever !
they do n't give enough info on what i need to do .
the worst company i have ever dealt with .
the worst .
i have had a terrible experience after buying home insurance in tucson , az .
they promised me an annual premium of $ _num_ .
and i made two substantial payments , more than was owed on the policy .
peter - arizona
i would also give this company a negative rating if i could .
this has been a nightmare .
we heard nothing from her and received no emails .
nothing received .
_num_ hours later .
no check .
i 'm beginning to wonder if we 'll ever get paid for this car .
worst company in the world .
i had no idea how bad they were .
it 's unbelievable how incompetent and inefficient this company is at handling insurance claims .
nightmare and a bunch of liars !
a month and a half and counting because we still do n't have one .
read the other reviews , there is a serious problem .
run , do not walk away from this company .
we went to this place to get a tow package installed on our suv .
customer service is the worse here .
i have n't been in awhile and wanted fish tacos on saturday .
i spit it out and tossed it in the trash .
tried the second taco ... same thing .
had i been at the store , i would have demanded my money back .
i will never know because they lost my business !
neither are friendly .
ordered : nachos with grilled chicken .
worst customer service ever !
ordered photos online and never received them ?
another _num_ weeks passed and i still do n't have them ?
really feeling like i got ripped off here .
total charge for this service ; almost $ _num_ with tax .
the box itself can be purchased for $ 2-3 online or local moving companies .
my fault for not doing a little research ahead of time .
oh , but i have a packing guarantee against damage .
not a happy customer here !
$ _num_ for box and packing .
slow and challenging service , limited ability to print on site .
i 'll try to avoid coming back .
might be the worst fedex store i ever visited .
employees do n't want to help you .
i visited the store twice , twice worst experiences .
very rude people here .
when i walked in , the place stunk .
it was bad .
this weekend 's pizza was overly saucy .
i 'm not looking forward to returning anytime soon .
the pizza itself was ok .
they show up at almost _num_ , and bring diet pepsi !
now really , how hard is it to screw that order up ?
thing about it is we did n't learn our lesson the first time .
_num_ minutes for a pizza and wings .
i walked in and he said _num_ .
very unprofessional and very loud and does not make me interested in coming back .
i would not have ordered food from here if it took this long .
would not recommend at all .
avoid this place if possible .
overly priced pizza and wings that ca n't even be enjoyed .
wings were expensive , but only mediocre .
nothing to go back for .
i had a terrible experience here .
i would not recommend this computer store .
did they run out and hit up costco in a pinch ?
my large chicken bowl was not packed very full .
i went here for lunch last week .
needless to say i was a little grossed out .
it 's pretty gross .
it was a saturday night , peak dinner time .
no balsamic or herbs or salt .
that would 've been fine , if they olive oil was fantastic .
my lobster ravioli primarily tasted of the spinach pasta that surrounded it .
it could 've really used some garlic , salt , and some herbs .
this particular location has issues with the food being overdone .
i am very bummed out about this .
salad arrived fairly promptly but i quickly noticed it was far from fresh .
looked like bag salad about _num_ days old .
he was clueless and it showed in food quality and service .
never again , i say .
_num_ .
i 'm okay with a leisurely dining pace , but this was ridiculous .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
-i ordered chicken parmigiana .
- i could go on , but you get the point .
i did not eat all and just had my lemonade .
they said we could not make any changes to menu blah blah .
then maybe they will stop by and take your drink order .
wait staff was slow to take drink and food order .
bread made it to the table _num_ minutes after we sat down .
i will not go back again .
then had a chicken caesar salad .
another friend had the same problem !
place was dead and there is a reason for that .
after dinner , _num_ min wait for a dessert with _num_ tables occupied !
had n't been here for some time .
went late on a friday with only _num_ tables being served .
food portions much smaller and prices more expensive than i remember .
wait staff very talkative and offended one of my dining companions .
i also asked for a peach tea that i never received .
it 's too bad this was such a bad experience .
will not be back .
service was nice , but slow .
food was bland , over cooked and luke warm - cold .
from the appetizer to the entrees , nothing was up to previous visits .
would not recommend going back until something big changes .
service was terrible .
that should have been my clue .
but tonight it was awful .
terrible service !
fail !
there is no excuse for such terrible service !
i wish i had read the other reviews before we ate here .
lazy and apathetic is no way to go through life .
terribly understaffed .
not exaggerating i was on an hour lunch break i was watching the clock .
may try for dinner but never again for lunch !
apparently they do n't have it anymore .
the service was alright , just not sure if i would return again .
not a chance in the world !
no personality , rude , slow , terrible service .
very arrogant .
never go back to this place again !
i grabbed my card out of his hand and left .
and i said your professionalism is lacking .
worst meals every .
meals took _num_ and half hours .
needless to say i was less than impressed at this point .
do n't waste your time or money at this place .
there must be a good reason this place was empty on a friday night .
we went for lunch and had the worst experience .
our service was incredibly slow .
the food took _num_ minutes to arrive at our table .
the drinks were rarely refilled .
i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone !
the manager wound up bringing our food out and refilling our drinks for us .
all of this would have been fine .
the worst thing that will _num_ % keep me from returning was the water .
it tasted like toilet water .
that is no exaggeration .
it was so gross .
plus i imagine they cook with this water so that is also gross .
i should have checked yelp before taking my wife to this place .
she walked us to a booth , but barely spoke a word .
then we met our waiter , jose .
we will never return to this restaurant .
i have n't been here in about a year .
i wo n't be back .
the women 's restroom needs the sewer drain cleaned out , it stinks !
both , mine and my husband dinner looked pathetic .
i never even tried my food .
it looked gross .
it is our 25th anniversary , made reservations and could n't get a booth .
we had to wait forever for our food that was bland and boring .
we will have to go elsewhere for awhile .
disappointed in the food .
my steak was served cold .
not even the large pat of butter on top melted not even slightly !
do not eat here if you want to have a good night !
this evening 's dinner was a disaster !
after explaining the problem to the female manager on duty she was not helpful .
all in all it was almost and _num_ horse before the checks were correct .
it was the most horrific meal experience we have ever had !
how much more plain can i make it ?
i did n't even bother to argue the point .
that 's just gross .
i just do n't get it .
thanks for nothing , mcdonald 's .
management is terrible .
i had ordered two hot spicy and a club with dollar fry .
not hard .
worse location ever !
it was super thin and did n't have much flavor .
ummm , i guess nothing now .
ridiculous .
Negative
if i could give them negative stars i would .
long story short , they believe because they are the only company i .
we are talking , usually _num_ days late .
the cook in the back should taste the sauce before sending it out .
meh , oriental express does n't do it for me .
the vegetable eggroll was just disappointing .
soggy exterior and not so great .
i am not sure how you suck the flavor out of meat .
my boyfriend hated his food so much that he did n't finish .
i got the house chicken and it was bone dry .
it looked like they 'd completely forgotten the sauce altogether .
i have never in my life returned oriental food to the store before today .
aside from the terrible food , the restaurant itself is a dive .
i had some hot and sour soup and boy it was sour alright !
the place overall was not appealing to the eye .
monday memorial day ) we called oriental express for take out .
it was very ( hot ) spicy .
i could n't eat it .
this place serves just plain below average - average chinese food .
yet i was torn between giving it `` meh '' or `` a-ok '' .
so i rated the place _num_ stars .
i ca n't believe i just spent $ _num_ here !
i do n't live anywhere near this place and i will never return .
wow , i ca n't believe how bad the food here tastes .
i 'm the biggest garlic fan but this was just wrong .
the pizza was really doughy and greasy .
this location is the worst !
who says no to a coupon that is printed in black and white .
wo n't be back even though i live right there !
they offered to send me another order but by now the damage was done .
will not order from here again .
the tomato taste was so overbearing that you could not taste anything else .
i will never eat here or order from here ever again .
absolutely horrible place of business .
however , i was disappointed after taking one bite of the pizza .
unfortunately , i probably wo n't be coming here again .
we were very disappointed with our experience with this place last night .
last night none , and the sandwich was not good .
the bread was tough and stale .
the meat was tasteless and cold .
my husbands ' pasta was good , but also cold .
do n't think we will be coming back to this place again !
not getting this ever again .
$ _num_ of delivery ordered and never to be heard of again .
he walks in to find _num_ employees chatting and hanging out .
mediocre food .
after such horrid customer service we will never order from here again .
too many great pizza places to eat at that fix their screw ups .
well , that was an unpleasant dinner .
so , the first time we went there we tried there pizza .
tonight decided to give them another try .
got back home and none made the way we requested .
customer service was none too great either .
tonight an hour and a half ... .
person who answered the phone did n't seem to think this was unreasonable .
i do not like food here .
gross beyond gross .
since i also do n't like bowling , i will not return .
would you turn away away a 20+ people party ?
one of the employees ruined mothers day for everyone who came with us .
so it was n't some small trip bowling .
i paid for something i never got last time .
i mean ... stupid move kid .
just do n't do it .
if you get this lane ... run !
he did n't care .
this was not the response i was expecting from a team lead .
there was no point saying anything to the employees .
they do n't care .
they hate working on friday and saturday nights obviously .
they deserve _num_ stars .
slow staff and they fail to acknowledge your presence .
customer service is non existent .
this company is horrible to deal with .
however , holly never called nor showed up .
little did i know this was the beginning of a nightmare .
seriously ... parked for an iced coffee ?
plus they give me my hot food to wait for a cold drink .
my first two visits to this place was not good .
so i wait for almost _num_ minutes .
2nd week : i order a bacon & cheese snack wrap .
instead i get the deluxe snack wrap .
i called their complaint line twice and i got no response to my complaints .
holy cow , worst customer service ever .
all soggy i get it it 's fast food but c'mon .
this is not about $ _num_ .
i waste more daily on things i dont need or cant remember buying .
i called several times and no one return my calls .
nobody , aside from my doctor had a good attitude .
it was most embarrassing and she was not nice about it .
there was no reason to be treated like this .
oops my bad !
it was $ _num_ .
he even gave me a box to carry the drinks safely !
i get to my bro 's and we sit down to eat .
ummmm it was bad folks i could n't even bare to take a picture .
there was nothing good about this or worth the $ _num_ it cost .
it also had the same pink tomato 's in it .
this place gets _num_ thumbs down .
maybe breakfast would be better !
pricey little sandwich joint and cheap atmosphere .
the restaurant itself is a generic , sterile looking hole in the wall .
for the worse .
the kind that falls apart when dipped in the au jus and no flavor .
you can taste that the meat is not fresh .
sorry full belly deli , i do n't recommend you to anyone .
i wish i would have gone to port a sub like i had planned .
the meatballs tasted like they had been store bought and frozen for some time .
the coleslaw had way too much mayonnaise .
will not recommend .
not worth the time of day .
this place sucked .
the younger ones were mostly ugly and or fat .
the music choice sucked .
i would not bring friends here unless they were old or ugly .
_num_ ) the dj sucks .
his speakers kept cutting out , and he had no skill .
worst bar in the n. phoenix !
you sir are no bouncer , just a fat kid with an attitude .
one group has one round , other group has another .
he disrespected me and my friend so much i will never come back !
rude staff .
me and group were totally turned off and disrespected and left .
ladies night worst nightmare .
sorry for the bad review .
he has no care in the world about what goes on there .
chicken salad _num_ pieces with uncooked areas .
my experience with claim jumper occurred on thursday during lunch .
at this point , i had lost my patience .
so he finally walked away .
i find this whole experience unacceptable .
no more , no less .
dinners arrived a little more then _num_ hour after ordering .
do n't order the calamari , it was the worst and so chewy !
started going to cj years ago in california .
i should have gotten a couple whole ones to go .
seasoning was so-so and overall , just another mediocre third visit .
just a tip , do n't eat here ... ever !
so sad , cj used to be so good .
our last visit ( which could be our last ) was horrible .
i was brought a bottled beer that was _num_ months expired .
the spinach dip lacked taste and the chips were cold .
cookie on the dessert was hard and cold .
not sure we will be back .
i do n't know what 's been wrong .
i went for lunch last week , around 11am with my boyfriend .
too dark to even read a menu .
you just knocked out all the lights in the whole row . ''
mashed potatoes and vegetables were forgettable , too .
_num_ star for non-existent service , _num_ stars for mediocre , overpriced food .
when we ordered our drinks we also ordered the bottomless chips and salsa .
for our meal we ordered _num_ plates of street tacos .
it was not the waitress who brought them .
they simply asked , who has the fish ... who has the pork .
and still no chips and salsa that we ordered initially .
no extra plate or info to this regard .
and i had _num_ people bring me a salad .
no problem , we request more salsa .
but it does n't look like much more salsa .
cj used to be one of our favorite restaurants .
it was n't even a full section .
i have eaten here before but not in about a year .
took _num_ minutes to get food and half was cold .
french fries cold , hamburger cold , fish tacos warm .
sent back the burger and fries and they were returned in about _num_ minutes .
manager brought them and told me the hamburger was not cold .
so i guess when i touched it before i could n't tell the difference .
food was all bland and no taste .
hamburger obviously processed and frozen and then cooked .
it was a very disappointing visit .
service - poor .
the last three times i 've been here , the service has been horrible .
the wait staff is slow and not very friendly .
basically , it ruined my meal and in return ruined our family dinner .
if you do go -- do not order a steak !
as recently as _num_ , we were eating at cj almost every week .
rip , cj .
food prepared wrong .
manager said she would fix things but did n't .
took mom here for a special birthday dinner and was very disappointed .
presentation was also bad .
very bland looking .
service was also very slow and drink refills were almost nonexistent .
probably wo n't go back .
not worth the money .
claim jumper is alright , their healthy options are not that great .
atmosphere is nothing great but and the staff are a little slow although friendly .
very disappointing .
i was very underwhelmed with the flavor of the dish .
it is disappointing to pay $ _num_ for frozen fish and fries .
_num_ min later she returned with the rest of our _num_ orders of fish .
that was cheap !
told her about the sign , she said that it was n't any good .
sorry , a little to late , should have come over when we asked .
this was the first time having dinner out on thanksgiving .
the menu was extremely limited and over priced .
despite having reservations we still had to wait _num_ minutes to be seated .
the turkey was dry and lukewarm .
to me it feels like they simply do n't care .
the service was also lacking .
this next , and most recent occasion was this past friday .
the food was better , but not worth what they charge .
the fries are n't anything to speak of either .
i really try hard to like this place .
for a _num_ dollar meal it is not worth the treatment .
there are better steakhouses in town with much better staff .
unfortunately the cook has a very heavy hand with salt .
we all know how bad salt is for us .
i had a sweet potato on the side , awful , awful , awful !
not impressed .
i really do n't like much about this place .
incredibly slow wait staff and the food is just okay .
too many other options around if i want to spend this type of money .
... you can walk right in and get your pick of tables .
i might know why .
but my food was so salty , it was like eating a salt lick .
what a mistake that was .
had _num_ waitress & then we had a waiter .
the meat was like shoe leather & the shrimp was like chewing on cardboard .
i have never had such a bad meal .
although the manager took off _num_ meal it it still left a bad taste .
prices seem extreme for the poor quality .
_num_ cheese pancake was good .
the service was not good .
the bartenders are so unfriendly and the staff in the bar area are rude .
do n't think we will be going to cj ever again .
ordered an expensive hamburger that was below average .
fries dry and thin .
avoid this place !
why in the world did i eat here on wednesday night ?
it was chicken with a side of gross green beans and weird rice .
friend ordered the halibut or white fish and it smelled and tasted awful .
we did n't even stomach 1/4 of the food as it was just nasty .
not impressed with their food at all .
after _num_ hours i still had n't heard anything so i called back .
i 've been here twice because it 's really close to me .
they never called me back .
they quoted me _num_ hours labor .
at the end , i paid $ _num_ cash .
still feel severely robbed , though .
turned around and walked out .
i just called for a quote and these people seem to not like customers .
this jack sucks .
he walks off and i step closer to the register to place my order .
by that point i just left .
went here tonight through the drive thru and the manager was so rude .
probably the worst fast food employees i 've ever seen on today 's visit .
service on any weekday is terrible .
for the first time , yelp has burned me .
i see nothing but glowing reviews , but what i got was n't amazing .
it was mediocre .
this tasted like fried beef .
do n't believe the hype .
the tamales i bought from this one were dried out and bland .
i threw most of them away .
her : rolling eyes ... .
her : huh ... what else ?
you just ca n't fix stupid !
the food was edible , and bland , and flavorless .
the carne asada tacos were full of onions too .
the food was flavorless and generic .
treated my family horrible .
i purchased a groupon for an oil change .
was told : `` they do n't really make appointments .
so he also says saturdays are walk ins .
so i get there saturday at 8am .
but maybe he 'll have to hold me over until monday '' .
i am honestly shocked that this place has any customers with this lazy attitude .
i called the one on thomas ( near my work ) .
made an appointment in _num_ minutes for monday afternoon an actual appointment .
terrible for oil changes .
they just need to step up their oil change service .
when i got my car , it needed an alignment .
the kit they said i had to have was _num_ $ .
it 's sad .
it 's really sad .
horrible horrible horrible to say the least .
went in for oil , they convinced me i needed a transmission flush .
they completely lost my business today .
and no one has ever called me back !
call me jerry fletcher , please !
food is bland .
had to grab a waiter for refills .
zero complaints over _num_ years and dozens of locations across the us .
then got attitude like we had done something wrong like switched seats or something .
horrible customer service from not very knowledgeable wait staff .
the manager simply refused to help or provide an explanation .
wo n't be coming back .
i 'm a better cook than the guys in back .
likely wo n't return .
this location is often understaffed and unable to handle the weekend crowds anyway .
the waitress seemed overworked and she got the order wrong _num_ times .
okay , let 's get one thing straight right off the bat .
one star is too much for the food they are serving .
the grits were just a bowl of flavorless mush .
no salt , no pepper , no butter .
not sure why they would n't serve their fresh sourdough bread with breakfast .
lame !
why ca n't we just pay the waitress ?
their eggs are rarely cooked as requested by the customer .
i sent it back and it came out slightly warmer .
the vegetables were overcooked .
my wife 's pork chops had no taste .
you looked upset and even argued with the poor customer .
i ate it in like _num_ minutes all of it .
kinda sucked .
the corn bread is gross .
the food is okay but nothing special .
they gave me _num_ servings of gravy and no grits or hash browns .
Neutral
i wish i could give negative star ratings .
food is disgusting .
the restaurant was pretty empty .
_num_ tables , _num_ woman each .
she came back shortly later with has brown casserole , biscuits and fried apples .
she apologized and told me she forgot to sub bacon instead of fried apples .
she quickly ran off to talk to the lady seated behind me .
i kindly threw it in the trash immediately after i left out the restaurant !
they were out of biscuits of all things .
we went there last night and had a really bad experience at this restaurant .
they have told us on numerous occasions that we would get a new door .
no it normal to lift but not after _num_ days !
horrible horrible horrible .
dont waste your money or time !
completely ripped off by that place .
thankfully she was n't the cook too .
the interior of this restaurant is just a huge mess .
nothing really makes sense in here .
it was really gross and reminded me of chewing on fat .
i could n't possibly ever go back here simply because of that .
i 'm not sure how sushi can be mediocre but it was .
i went there with a group of _num_ .
_num_ .
i am not sure that everyone else had even tried the dish .
expensive _num_ bite meal !
i am a reasonable person .
it 's not okay to not make your mistakes right .
a lack of integrity will make it 's way into your food .
went for dinner -- -- it was meh .
the sushi sign in the window caught my eye .
it had artificial crab that just had a strange taste .
as a sushi restaurant it is horrible as well .
the dishes come out with way too much sauce .
the sauce is not even a good flavor .
avoid this place at all costs .
this is pure lack of skill on sushi making .
the wait staff is also pushy and slow .
overall , not a good experience .
this place is nothing like it used to be .
do n't pay attention to what is listed on their website .
i am very disappointed in this place .
better food , better service , better prices at panda express .
i walked in and sat at the only clean table .
does n't get any better than this !
we will not be going back .
horrible .
the place is ok , but the staff is atrocious .
avoid this place until they find someone to run it with people skills .
my waffle was rather dense .
horrible service almost an hour to get our food .
she came and checked on my table once in _num_ minutes .
what a disaster .
very poor service !
after _num_ mins without food we checked out .
we normally enjoy this location .
we went in _num_ weeks ago on a tuesday night .
if not , its very unfair practice .
the manager is called and tells me she can not do that .
i am sorry but i am a business owner and used to work retail .
bad eggs and awful service !
this denny 's was n't even great .
wo n't come back .
i went here one time and will never go back .
they wrote our name down on the waiting list .
we told the management that their poor service cost them two customers .
ordered the $ _num_ biscuits and gravy with eggs and hash browns .
did not finish my food and left .
they did not charge me , that 's why they got two stars .
the cashier was slow incompetent and rude .
stay away from this s denny unless you want crappy food and worse service .
worst denny 's i 've ever been to .
horrible service and rude management .
thumbs down ... .
when you walk in , the counter has security bars all around it !
we stood for three minutes at the counter , ready to order .
who really gave this place so many stars ?
not sure on all the other reviews but never coming back here .
i only ate half my burrito and threw the rest away .
the favors were n't very good .
i paid for the meal and drove off .
i threw them away .
the chicken was not hot and juicy as i expected .
it was not warm and juicy .
thats right , it was cold and rubbery .
when i called to complain , the phone just rang and rang .
what an odd and disappointing experience !
she left a $ _num_ gift card .
beware : even the area manager does n't know how to resolve customer complaints .
well , they were cold .
and so was my fries and so was my co-workers chili .
she is extremely slow and consistently has 5+ people in line .
unbelievable experience .
no one greets me or anything .
here the food takes forever employees always in a bad mood .
this used to be the best wendy 's not sure what happened ... .
but man i ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and the chicken was barely there .
home depot lost two sales because of them .
i insisted on a refund and will purchase my doors at ace .
not my favorite experience .
i thought they were very overpriced & the staff was unfriendly .
they have hardly anything to choose from .
very inconsiderate and dishonest people are working in this company .
first , i had not given her the address .
they went back to work on my neighbor 's yard .
we have waited _num_ weeks to get our trees scheduled to be trimmed .
we 're now rescheduled two times and they still have not shown up .
greatly lacking in any customer service !
the bill was over $ _num_ .
the crew was arrogant and surly .
meanwhile two other companies were much more professional and respectful of my time .
he apologized for my experience and i appreciated that .
on the appointed day , they did n't show .
the girl who called said someone else would call me back .
they finally did show up - _num_ hours late - and did the work .
a week goes by & of course we do n't hear from them .
i called , & after _num_ calls back & forth - both to mr .
this time , they showed up , on time , & did the work .
do not use these people !
crew came & finished job over _num_ days in a little over _num_ hours .
some of their workers do n't know anything about how to shape a tree .
i called again the next day and left another voice mail .
oh , and that makes $ _num_ o.k .
for the removal of a fallen tree ?
no return phone call again !
however , the charge is excessive for _num_ minutes of work .
do not use this company !
wish i could give _num_ stars .
worst customer service ever .
we have left multiple messages and they do not call back .
and i just had to walk away .
they have no respect and i would absolutely never do business with them again .
truly ridiculous .
lead kind of talked down the sales guy too .
one time they were scheduled and did not shop up at all .
after this last experience , we will never call them again .
do n't bother unless you have weeks to wait .
they were also rude about it .
and bob spoke very badly about the other companies i was considering .
do not use this company !
they are grossly overpriced and they practice `` bait and switch . ''
then they sold me a program of feeding which cost a fortune .
poor and inconsistent service .
not a customer friendly location especially if you are a busy person .
i have rented from different locations before .
i would never recommend any one to rent out from this location ever .
this has been my worst experience at enterprise .
still loves : the prompt pick up and drop off service- thumbs up .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
perhaps the biggest disappointment was the costumer service and knowledge of the reps .
i ended up renting for _num_ days .
and no one once mentioned to me about the enterprise plus loyalty program .
i could not believe my ears .
ok , this is about how bad their employees are .
i am not paying for their mistake , they are .
explained everything , they will see what is needed to fix this .
what a hassle this entire ordeal has been .
a huge headache all around .
would never recommend .
is time i ca n't get back in my life .
if i could give internet service _num_ stars , i would .
my internet , which is `` the highest tier '' , is so inconsistent .
it goes in and out of service at least _num_ times a week .
anyway , i am gon na look for a new internet provider .
very disappointed in their customer service .
i kid you not , _num_ minutes later , i lose my internet connection .
so , i put in another call .
wrong .
i get my bill .
there was no partial month .
your website sucks , your customer service sucks , and your bullshit fees suck .
horrible service !
on top of the customer service being terrible the actual service is terrible too .
my sound is awful on some channels .
my picture is always freezing and being broken up like a scratched dvd .
faster , cheaper , and how much worse could the service be ?
e-mail support is even worse .
what a horrible joke .
no presence required .
sick of the devil you know ?
i let him know reschedule is the only option ... and called cox .
cox is the worst company i have dealt with in many years .
if i could give zero stars , that would be more appropriate .
they must be from an old survey .
i did the installation myself and the connection still did not work .
tried again and still nothing .
nothing special .
and shady fee practices .
i was informed there would be no charge for this service .
they tried to charge me $ _num_ for fixing their internet service .
too damn much for terrible service and incompetent support .
was told i would get nfl package and be able to watch all games .
asked _num_ times to confirm , was told yes .
turns out they only have red zone - which is not the games .
had the service less than one week , decided to cancel .
totally unacceptable , would never consider cox again .
the worst !
the on demand service that cox offers is really below par .
after being a loyal cox customer for _num_ years , its goodbye !
Neutral
negative stars .
# _num_ : cox has you self install your wifi and cable .
however , i installed mine correctly and no wifi was set up .
if not , then no charge .
he tells my dad there will be no charge .
of course , there was a $ _num_ charge on my next bill .
all i need to do is return my equipment .
truly horrendous .
can not believe a company would be okay with such horrible ratings and reviews .
cox needs to provide better customer training to their staff .
but it 's not .
apparently that was not convenient for them .
he repeated that they could do it tuesday morning .
no attempt to make this right .
customer service is terrible .
unfortunate !
my review is sadly in keeping with the others posted .
i give them _num_ star only because there is no zero .
if i could give them no stars i would .
notice i did n't say it was the best .
i 've been with cox for _num_ years , never late .
well , that 's not what i was told on _num_ december .
this company is out of control .
they charge to much for very poor service .
not sure how we could be off to a worse start .
cox cold called me to switch from direct tv and i made the switch .
my expectations are low .
cox is the absolute worse vendor i have ever done business with .
it was about _num_ years old , so it was probably time .
i 'm so tired of cox .
i will not look back or regret it .
all the _num_ star reviews i read were accurate .
it continued for another week and i cancelled .
then , they sent me a bill that included the service call .
i never knew how bad they treat customers until i had a problem .
do n't make that mistake .
very bad panda .
do n't come here after _num_ or the meat and broccoli will seem rotten .
do n't go after _num_ .
these bowls ai n't cheap .
i 'm `` strictly '' not gon na pay for half a bowl .
terrible !
a waste of $ _num_ .
this place really needs to figure out how to respect other people 's time .
this could have just been done over the phone .
if they send me any type of bill i will not pay it .
she could have been seriously hurt .
she has a handicap sticker and walks very slowly as the driver knew .
i would give this dentist office zero star if i could .
so i searched on google find out this place .
get there on time and fill out all the pepper works .
so she called the doctor from another room .
so the nurse walk out with me to the front desk to check out .
the two ladies can not decide and went back to ask the doctor .
she come out with $ _num_ i was shocked !
so i refused to pay and asked to speak with the doctor .
they think you from another county you do n't know nothing .
but do n't judge a person by a look !
not the ideal place to get work done .
not cool man .
my chili was not hot nor was the container filled .
my nuggets were old and stale .
very disappointed after this visit .
tried the bacon n bleu for the first time too .
went for lunch and was n't impressed .
the fries were just mediocre and the burger really was n't anything impressive either .
the only thing that gave this review a second star was the cherry limeade .
boiled hot dogs ... .
not my idea of good food .
will not be returning !
we ended up paying over _num_ $ on two small meals !
after a few minutes no one answered so i pushed the button again .
my technician was friendly but did not wear gloves .
the salon was clean but did not have a welcoming feeling .
there are too many better shops to visit .
ugh .
maybe they were having a bad day .
but everyone was horribly unfriendly .
when i walked in i asked for a fill .
she sat back and continued to mess with her iphone .
as i waited , i noticed everything was dirty , old and cluttered .
ick .
horrible dirty walls , floors , chairs !
the service was terrible and they were super unfriendly ... .
worst experience ever !
this was my first time getting my nails done .
apparently , this meant a full set with just the tips painted .
when i asked for the whole nail painted , the man said no .
i am never going back .
was out shopping with a friend before going to see a movie .
it 's _num_ outside in phoenix , az .
ross is located in an outdoor strip mall .
i am _num_ years old , not some obnoxious child .
worst ross ever !
hard to find and it is always empty and never good finds .
after a few trips i will not going back to this one !
the place is always dark , dank and dirty looking .
the service is always slow ... ... however the staff is friendly .
wo n't be coming back to this location .
worst service ever !
did n't receive a receipt and food was gross .
i was somewhat disappointed at the quality though .
will definitely try another place next time i 'm craving chinese .
they said yes , for $ _num_ .
they also said it would be _num_ minutes .
its too far . ''
way to run a bad business buddy and keep your word !
thanks for nothing , pink lotus !
ok , he took off to the back .
egg flower soup - it was bland , so bummed .
i was not happy with the beef lo main .
not a dish i would suggest .
but i do not think i am going to go there again .
not a fan , food was below average to us .
they are clearly not set up for dine in .
we ate inside and had an experience we do not wish to repeat .
bliss has definitely gone downhill .
this club is a rip of .
total dive ... not a single pretty dancer in the joint !
do n't waste $ $ $ on overpriced admission .
poor talent .
dancers cracked out running through the parking lot screaming .
what level of hell is this dive ?
funny they took me out and it 's gone downhill !
it 's rude .
the last few times i have been they have been lousy with scheduling .
it was a huge waste of time .
the worst nail salon i 've ever been to .
i did n't even leave the salon until almost seven !
i could n't believe it .
it 's lasted literally less than a week .
the leather is torn and ripped on the chairs .
the pedicure was less than stellar .
the standard comes with a hot stone , but no one offered a menu .
it was n't serious , and obviously an accident , but still not professional .
most nail places smell a little , by this place reeked !
i will not be back as i was severely disappointed on almost every point !
it seemed very unclean .
after i waited _num_ hour and _num_ minutes to see dr .
i would give them _num_ stars if i could .
sometimes hard to get dr note for work .
lab next door closed down so now _num_ tech runs a humble lab onsite .
want to talk about the lump in her breast ?
sorry , that requires yet another appointment .
it is now one week later and we ca n't get dr .
sink or anyone to call us back with the results .
if i could give less than one star , i would .
she also missed the tear in his knee .
charts are everywhere , the office is filthy and they are grossly understaffed .
and the doctor is terrible .
do n't go see dr .
she is a lousy doctor !
she does n't deserve the title of doctor .
sink is a complete idiot .
they do n't deserve even half a star !
my advice to anyone is do n't do it !
i dont know why i keep coming back !
there is not a single good thing i can say about my experience .
do not use this doctor !
if you truly value your health , do not use this physician !
horrible experience !
first of all : poor customer service !
the two girls at check-in were hispanic and spoke spanish to each other .
very rude when you have a patient standing at your window .
then was rude about the paper work we filled out prior .
very awful , rude environment .
they take people 's money and give horrible treatment .
will not be returning .
he was early !
something that takes less than _num_ minutes to do .
i feel like i 'm constantly being talked down too when i 'm here .
sink and her assistant .
words can not fully describe how horrible it is .
sink danielle and her assistant !
horrible horrible service !
she seems to be getting irritated because i 'm not blowing fast enough .
most awful experience i have ever had .
there is clearly no pride or integrity here .
ridiculous , ridiculous , ridiculous long waits !
i do n't even know why this place is still in business !
i do n't even know why my mother still comes here .
another trip that did n't go right at the drive-thru .
management might want to step up there game at this location .
this del taco is an absolute wreck !
not bad ... but not the rings .
this is by far the worst del taco on the planet .
order will be wrong about _num_ % of the time .
they have a new clueless person every time i go back .
then after his call he did n't change his gloves .
this place is garbage .
want to have homeless stare at you while you order your food ?
of all the del 's in phoenix this one is the worst .
one more place in this hell hole i wo n't be going back to .
we need a zero star rating here !
went through the drive thru , repeated the order .
was n't what was in the bag .
we love taco tuesday , but they just ca n't get it right .
no one in the drive thru at 6pm is usually a bad sign .
hard shell tacos are chewy and stale usually empty just to top it off .
stale stale stale .
usually del taco is wonderful but this location in particular is trash .
how do you mess up an order that you repeated back several times ?
slow service and rude employees .
got a bunch employees standing around doing nothing .
very rude unsanitary .
mike there was extremely rude and would not allow me to take the test .
called to schedule my ppl written exam .
the lady was extremely rude and hung up on me .
will not do any business with this company in the future .
my first quest was to buy some grapes .
the coupon said $ _num_ off for a pound or more .
i did n't want _num_ pounds , plus of course , they cost more .
for some reason , this target store did not impress me .
they had a very poor selection of clothing in all areas .
this one is okay stocked but sometimes you need to double check the prices .
i did not like going to this target !
i ended up putting my stuff down and leaving .
do n't think i 'll be going back .
seriously the most awful target bathrooms .
the store is n't stocked very well and is dingy .
this target is horrible .
this target is crap .
worst customer service i have ever experienced .
which is fine , but the fact is the costume is missing pieces .
that was horrible customer service !
Neutral
wish it was possible to give a negative _num_ star review !
while i was still speaking she turned around and walked away !
i walked out and called corporate which also was not very much help .
the cashiers customer service is usually only okay .
today it was terrible .
_num_ star .
false advertising .
bad customer service .
i will not come back to this location .
not a fan at all .
i have been in several times and the owner is flat out rude .
watched her interact with other customers and she made them uncomfortable as well .
whatever you do , do not move in here .
and you can not get a hold of the management of the park ever .
do n't waste your time , money and energy on this place .
i had their security stop my visitors from visiting .
all the sinks leaked and they have never been fixed .
i am looking forward to getting out of here and getting my health back .
do not give this place your business .
not recommended at all , i should have gone to chevy first .
this place is the bait and switch masters .
pay cash and do n't trust this little guy with your credit card .
i 've gone here twice simply to put gas .
the first time i go there , the card doesnt work at the pump .
i go back out to pump and nothing .
it 's not working .
i 'm like what the crap ?
she goes , did n't you say pump _num_ ?
i said no , i said $ _num_ on _num_ .
i yell back , no .
i wo n't be back and recommend you avoid .
this office has the worst office staff ever !
they are horrible .
the office staff is rude and unprofessional .
find another doc guys , this office is a joke .
Negative
not exactly what i would call a great place to eat .
the pay structure is confusing if you 're not familiar with the industry .
the term `` flat rate hour '' is often used .
ultimately , it was mostly a waste of time from our perspective .
time and money we can never get back .
this place is only out to take your money .
they just want your money .
i could write a book on how bad this place is .
all i can say is just do n't do it .
the school cost more to attend than a mechanic will ever make .
if i could i 'd give it _num_ stars .
not just vets , but all students .
this place is misleading in what type of facility is .
wrong !
if you 're looking for an urgent type facility , this is not it .
save yourself the trouble , go to phoenix children 's .
it is not just me either .
totally unacceptable !
_num_ .
he was _num_ min .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
the major fault is staff training .
so for _num_ days i stayed in a smoking room .
getting out of that room was the only way to breathe better .
i was set to leave in only _num_ days .
the hotel did n't bother calling my cell phone .
- if you like chocolate chip muffins , better get up early .
the place is filthy and disgusting .
nothing looked clean .
i wish i never left my tent !
beds are so uncomfortable .
i have stayed many hotels but this is the worst bed .
the front staff does n't explain anything to you upon check in .
be prepared to take out your own trash .
they seem to never have enough towels .
no swimming pool !
are you kidding me ?
talk about making a customer feel low !
what 's not to dislike .
it 's expensive for what you get , which is n't much .
i would pay $ _num_ - $ _num_ for the real thing .
i 've been here about _num_ hours .
oh and my room is _num_ degrees with little hope of getting any color .
you should avoid also .
it was disgusting !
when we explained our disappointment to the ladies at the front desk .
another words , stay as far away from this hotel as possible .
_num_ .
they did poor work .
_num_ .
_num_ .
they made the existing condition worse .
_num_ .
_num_ .
they failed to follow instructions .
_num_ .
they failed make things right in the end .
do n't waste your time or money ... .
i could n't believe what i was hearing .
she refused to bring over the display and ok that 's no biggie .
she even filed my nails after the manicure was done and dried .
terrible customer service .
terrible first experience .
i will not be back there again .
still too thick in the back and does n't lay right .
do not do not do not get your hair cut here !
not what i wanted , and not a good look .
there 's only so much she could do .
all-in-all , this was the absolute worst hair experience i have ever had .
before being allowed near anyone else 's head .
i will not be coming back to this place ever again .
i do n't even know if my hair cut is even good or not .
horrible and i would know because i am a professional hairdresser and she sucked !
i immediately drove my car around the building to show the attendant the damage .
bottom line folks ... .
i immediately drove my car around the building to show the attendant the damage .
bottom line folks ... .
do n't go to this car wash !
second time did n't even dry my car .
it is a very small place in a shady strip mall .
* orange chicken - came with fried rice and an egg roll .
the egg roll was pretty good but the fried rice was nasty .
it tasted stale and had a weird flavor .
the orange chicken was just ok .
i would n't order the meal again though .
the broth tasted sweet and was just weird .
it pains me to write this review .
i got the orange chicken lunch special with a side of stuffed jalapeos .
the orange chicken was n't the greatest i 've ever had .
stuffed jalapeo where good , descent .
egg roll served with meal had way too much black pepper .
_num_ : crack head paradise outside of the `` restaurant '' .
( why i proceeded to order i have no frickin clue ) .
_num_ pretty stupid expensive .
$ _num_ for a small plate for one _num_ the food .
lo mein : tasted exactly like old stinky cabbage .
first time , i probably would have given _num_ stars .
however , _num_ hour and _num_ min later , our order arrives .
not cool .
do n't take my word for it .
not good at all .
this is a total dump with average to bad food .
frankly it was a waste of calories .
there are too many good chinese food options to return here .
i ordered the hot and sour soup and the dinner lo mein combo .
the lo mein dish is okay , nothing special .
i would not eat here and if u do , u need cash !
very outdated and not modern .
there 's a gym upstairs but i never see people going there .
the bad ?
total was $ _num_ which i thought to be very reasonable .
the girl told me _num_ min on the pretzel and fries .
i got the pretzel in _num_ min and the fries in _num_ min .
i was so pissed since the match started by then .
that was a total joke .
so apparently buying a ticket does not guarantee you a seat .
ridiculous .
have low , low expectations before coming here and it shall not disappoint .
i just do n't get it .
everything just seems a little dated and worn out .
i went to get my haircut today .
i let the gentleman know again that he is cutting my hair too short .
again with the complete disregard to what i 'm saying .
my wife could hear me from across the salon .
just a bit shorter on the sides , not short !
i remind him that i well saying it 's too short .
he ignored me .
in the end , he finished my haircut and offered his apologies .
i hate wearing product in my hair .
the stylist ( vietnamese gentleman ) does not listen !
the hours posted say 9am , and it is now well after _num_ .
first time reviewer ... because of my frustration during this visit .
after waiting for _num_ minutes a dad and his two sons arrived .
as i assumed , they had booked appointments over the phone .
the stylists did not inform me of this , the customer did .
i could n't hold back a small yelp of pain .
no apology .
another small yelp of pain .
no apology .
i was offered _num_ , $ _num_ off coupons .
i am going to stick to my location over at camelback .
_num_ minute wait , not bad .
it 's $ _num_ just to be seen .
very very frustrating experience .
however , the wait time is ridiculous .
i mean , i set an appointment for a reason .
had a long wait then , but i did n't really care that day .
kinda want outta here .
it 's too long of a wait .
this place is terrible .
after an hour and a half , i was still not seen .
this just was not acceptable .
this is the worst place ever !
then , you sit in another room by yourself for another hour .
urgent care is horrible !
avoid if you can and just go see your own physician .
then i had an appointment for a follow up visit right after my pt .
do n't worry i 'm not hungry or anything .
worst fucking place ever .
everything they do in there is down right slow as fuck .
they need to get more skilled , qualified workers in there .
this place is an absolute fucking joke !
there was little hint of garlic , and none of herbs .
went with a friend for lunch on sunday and it was alright .
wrong !
never going back .
waiting for about _num_ minutes ... .
at this time i was totally disgusted .
everything tasted as though from the frozen section of a grocery store .
soup was canned soup .
pizza was horrible .
burnt garlic toast .
uncooked soggy dough crust .
service was abysmal too .
sorry i just can not recommend this place to anyone .
worst food i ever had ... .
please do n't waste your time or money .
ate here twice , years apart and got food poisoning both times .
horrible , just horrible .
a lackluster meal all around .
they pass this platter off for _num_ .
i could n't take more than two bites of it .
the tomato sauce is overly sweet and basically flavorless .
now for the service .
bad .
i will not be returning ... ever .
waitress `` maggie '' has no common sense .
still wo n't go back again .
eggplant parmigiana - eggplant was cut to thick and slightly undercooked .
the pasta was cooked well but the sauce lacked any direction .
meatball hero - sauce was bland .
the staff is friendly but very loud - particularly one waitress .
the food is ok , but i can get ok italian food anywhere .
really yelpers , you think _num_ stars ?
the pizza was pedestrian at best and the lasagna was just down right bad .
mediocre as best .
the only reason this place got _num_ stars was the for the fries .
they only thing that was decent was the shoe string fries .
i added pepper and salt , but it was still a bit lacking .
however , after last night i assure you that my family will not return .
we ordered the cheesy garlic bread and a pizza .
i saw him spit out the bit and he stated he bit something hard .
we had them remove the cheesy garlic bread from the table .
had mixed experiences here over the years .
guitar center in general is a difficult place to shop .
waste of time and gas .
nice people but they could n't give less of a shit about their job .
do not trade in your gear it is a ripoff !
this company is run by the biggest assholes in retail !
s o they will miss me but i wont miss them .
never returns emails or phone calls .
are you kidding me ?
$ _num_ in installation and taxes ?
my sister took her van in yesterday because it was running a little rough .
do not use the bathroom - fair warning .
it was worse than anything you can imagine .
someone could have picked up the trash and cleaned the bathroom .
totally foul .
the sauce had zero flavor .
horrible !
i probably wont spend my money here again .
their wings are pretty tasty , but the pizza is mediocre at best .
the guy tells me they have a wrong address but a right phone number .
not sure about these guys .
bad first time experience .
_num_ bucks for wings and pizza ?
the pizza though was bland , very bland .
it was also a little under cooked for my liking too .
i wo n't be back though .
i dont even know why anyone likes this place .
all their meats taste exactly the same , like nasty rubber salami .
thanks , but no thanks .
no thanks !
no flavor just salty and plain !
tried it for the first time tonight .
i guess my expectations were set too high by all the reviews i read .
i order cheese enchiladas and the cheese was not melted inside .
the guy taking orders was not very friendly at all .
my boyfriend 's cali burrito had fries that were n't fully cooked .
i think only one nail is smooth like it is supposed to be .
i wo n't be going back .
she said `` and you 're having your nails done '' ?
overall she had horrible customer service and was really rude .
obviously very disorganized and not a great first impression .
they considered an empty , short hallway as a room .
have used _num_ different companies over the years and they were the worst .
the owner was a nice lady but the cleaning crew was lazy .
not impressed .
while initially pleased , we keep finding major misses .
arrogant and really creepy .
high prices and lack luster customer service from staff .
very disappointed with this particular location .
just a very dismal atmosphere and a severe lack of customer service .
maybe that is why the employees act the way they do ?
this place is trash !
two things that i was not when i walked into this store .
she says he can price match the dog food to $ _num_ .
the dog food in the store is $ _num_ .
he can only price match $ _num_ ?
i did not yell .
i did not make an outrageous demand .
i could n't believe him and his terrible customer service .
their store is dark , dingy , and dirty .
the employees do n't wear uniforms which makes them seem unprofessional .
the entire atmosphere of the store is depressing .
_num_ out of _num_ things that petco is lacking .
petco is not where the pets go .
no offer to transfer the call .
then told there would be a _num_ week wait before i could be seen .
do not go here .
i warned you .
i too would give it less then one star .
i feel they lack education an knowledge about teeth .
i do n't feel like they care about the patients at all .
the only nice thing about this dental chain is the payment plan they offer .
however , i rather go elsewhere .
this is one of the worst companies i have dealt with .
i have left several messages with no return call .
the call center does n't even know what time the office opens .
my wait time was not as bad as the others .
use this place as a `` last resort '' for your dental needs .
check everywhere else first before using this companies services .
i 'm so disgusted with them .
i had an exam and they told me what work was needed .
they are very dishonest .
i guess everyone is nice when they 're taking your money .
absolutely no communication .
ridiculous .
they are severely understaffed with only one person watching the main lobby .
the customer service at this location is the absolute worst .
however we never actually stayed .
i did show up _num_ minutes early prior to my scheduled time .
very rude .
very bad customer service .
new frames and another _num_ + week wait for them .
so disappointing !
i do not recommend for a bday party !
you only have the party room for a designated time .
so , i went home and i gave these medications to my cat .
the woman told me the doctor was busy and could n't take my call .
anyhow , the vet never called .
the other medication i was given were broken pills .
they charged me almost $ _num_ for the bad meds as well .
for boarding , pick another place .
went in to talk to someone about it and they obviously do n't care .
awful .
worst customer service .
checked the end cap - none .
im assuming this was who i was previously on the phone with .
i wish i could score this zero stars !
an employee told me i was n't allowed to sit .
what the hell ?
michaels will never get my money again .
terrible customer service .
_num_ mins .
later , no call and no tech .
that would put him almost exactly at _num_ hours late .
worst business experience all year .
do not waste your time with this company .
terrible a/c units & terrible service .
they will be here tomorrow and how would i like to pay for it ?
they have continued to ignore me .
it is clear that they do not stand behind their work .
hold time on customer service line was _num_ minutes .
would not use them again .
do not use this company !
i scheduled an appointment for a routine maintenance .
first off , they told me the wrong date .
by _num_ no one had showed up .
what terrible customer service .
every year it is some new problem .
so of course today it is still not cooling properly .
never happened , i gave up .
heck no .
do not use them for any service .
worthless !
_num_ years ago our home was built .
it was _num_ degrees that day .
they insisted they could have done the repair .
so frustrating !
wish i would of known more about hvac then .
same thing .
all said terrible install .
i looked online and these units can be had for $ _num_ plus install .
probably could have had a new unit by now .
really these guys are happy with such sloppy work .
_num_ mins .
later , no call and no tech .
that would put him almost exactly at _num_ hours late .
worst business experience all year .
do not waste your time with this company .
Neutral
just look at all of the other negative reviews here .
businesses ca n't pay yelp to fluff their reviews .
these guys are horrible .
completely unacceptable .
if they are that busy they need to hire more people or something .
the worst experience ever with any service company in my _num_ years in az .
i can not believe they are still in business .
there was no problem with this repair .
my first thought was , ok , how much could that be ?
he then stated that he still needed to collect $ _num_ regardless .
bottom line , do n't trust them .
- our a/c quit working one friday afternoon last august .
- they showed up that afternoon and diagnosed the problem -- failed compressor .
might as well get a new outside unit .
it 's not .
never said a word about it .
what a complete ripoff .
worst company ever .
it 's going to be _num_ today .
be careful of a/c warranty work .
they 'll do the cheapest fix possible .
our ac has broken twice in the last month .
this is completely unacceptable .
it is now _num_ and we still have no tech .
so , i called and asked to speak to a supervisor .
please do n't write the company `` we 're so sorry '' response .
i do n't want to hear it .
not a good start for new system warranty .
took the day off work to wait for the tech .
unacceptable service .
nope , cancel this install .
but i 'm still not going to hire a contractor i ca n't trust .
worst hvac company , hands down .
glad to know they purchase lousy parts .
apparently cutting other people off on a single lane road is your priority .
certainly wo n't be getting my business .
it is loud .
it 's like sitting next to a big fan blowing right in your ear .
it has n't helped .
waste of money .
unfortunately , an ac is not a small purchase that can be returned .
i do n't recommend this company , unfortunately .
and then tried to talk me into an annual service contract .
air would blow , but the ac unit itself would not come on .
he then tried to sell me a new ac unit .
he confirmed it was not .
roberts _num_ or _num_ stars , but they really dropped the ball today .
at _num_ ; _num_ with no call or tech i asked wtf .
i was told that apparently they slipped my date to friday , may _num_ .
plus their customer service is terrible .
do not use this company .
so i tried again at 10am .
the point of a scheduled appointment is that someone will be there .
what a huge disappointment .
all around poor service and poorly designed system and original installation to begin with .
i would never use them for anything for out of warranty service .
do not use this company !
a rude customer service agent answer the phone .
i could n't believe how bad the service was over the phone .
not even close .
the phone representative is dismissive .
the worst customer service !
bottom line horrible horrible company to do business with do not !
do n't do business with these people .
i wonder how much this mistake of theirs is going to cost me .
big expensive mistake !
ridiculous .
i arrived at opening ( 9:30 ) and shopped around for _num_ minutes .
this is unacceptable behavior for management of a department store .
terrible practice .
all the staff have tattoos that look like gang tattoos .
rude , rude , rude is really all i can say !
was n't overly impressed , but it was meh , whatever !
i 'm not asking to change because i did n't like him .
do not schedule an appointment with this office .
do not waste your time with this practice !
i wish there was less then a star .
the wait time is horrible for all appointments .
i just wish it was how i felt .
i do not trust this practice .
the office staff is very rude .
no caring here that is for sure .
i would not recommend them to my worse enemy !
so disappointed with this practice .
ridiculous .
this was not the case and i wo n't be back .
in the mean time ... might i suggest some food safety training ?
this place is gross .
nothing was edible .
never ever going back .
the place stinks like cigarettes and the service is terrible .
the food is mediocre , ihop may be better .
the skillet was terrible .
we did n't eat beyond the top egg layer .
my oldest got a waffle and youngest ordered _num_ eggs ala carte .
the bill was $ _num_ !
for garbage !
we did n't even eat the majority of the skillet .
i would not recommend this place .
walked in and was seated right away .
sat and within _num_ minutes was ordering and another _num_ minutes my food arrived .
i went to the restroom and it was disgusting !
the wait staff was nice .
i had high hopes for this place but it was so gross !
i ordered a veggie skillet , with an english muffin & bacon .
the potatos were soggy with no flavor almost as if they were mashed .
the tomatoes were light pink and also mushy .
the english muffin tasted like regular toast and was soggy .
the waitress was nice but not really all that pleasant .
i 'm not sure what 's remodeled or how bad it looked before .
i do n't like being told i ca n't order something .
the pancakes were not cooked completely .
what _num_ breakfast ?
dodge this place .
dishonest advertising .
the place is old and run down .
we ordered apple juice to the tune of _num_ and no free refills .
it was n't even cold i had to ask for ice .
the only thing we ordered that was good was the philly cheese steak .
the hash browns and home fries had no flavor at all .
completely bland .
the gravy for the biscuits and gravy had no flavor .
very expensive for poor quality .
the place looks run down and dirty .
not going there again .
even with buy one get one its expensive for what it is .
complete waste of time and money .
the front desk gave me a dirty room .
requested non smoking but room smell like full of cigarette .
never booking a room in this hotel again .
there was n't a separate unit for the bedroom so it was very stuffy .
there was no one at the front desk when i walked in .
most likely wo n't stay at this one again .
every one of them , with _num_ different types of ammo .
but i guess i was supposed to be thankful for the favor .
so i 've experience better .
my nervous dog did n't understand and decided it would be best to fight .
they find any way to squeeze a dime out of you !
she could n't even get up for god 's sake !
the staff cares more about the money than the animals .
do not use this clinic - period .
guess we just might find out .
of course , no one is saying what is in that report - yet .
my sweet puppy is dead .
had by far worst encounter with the vet here today .
what a dump of a place run by a jerk of a vet .
if your on a budget then you probably have no choice .
i feel bad for my dogs .
instead , i was ripped off .
i had chosen my meal from the menu and ordered it .
if i could give burger king no stars i would .
i really looked forward to it but not anymore .
i kept going thinking maybe it was just a fluke but it wasnt .
its just disgusting .
i think i will stick to jacks from now on .
another well executed breakfast sandwich only _num_ problems .
horrible customer service !
i 'm never going back !
i had a horrible experience here .
the ice machine in the dining area was out of ice .
lazy employees that take forever and have no customer service .
yet they want $ _num_ an hour lol .
that 's all i was there for at the time .
there would have been a second half to this review .
but there is n't going to be a second half to this review .
the bar is dark wood and uncomfortable booths , the staff is friendly sometimes .
hmmm , so i always asked the wait staff or bartender why ?
the tax on the liquor was nonexistent wow !
i give them _num_ stars only because of the chicken wings !
the wings are awesome , i 'll give them that .
run down and gross .
the owner is less than deserving of anyone 's business .
this place has been sad the past few times i went .
there wasnt much people in the bar pretty mellow .
until one of the workers came out wasted and couldnt hold himself up !
the food was terrible this time as the usual cook wasnt there.
nothing was done except for sarah saying its not hers and walking away .
disgusting .
low knowledge employees .
high prices , and they do n't even let you use their bathrooms .
bad all around experience .
they are rude , i doubt i will ever shop here again .
i would not shop here again .
after arriving there i received typical experience of shopping while you are black .
glad i did n't buy anything .
my experience at this staples was less than decent .
while the prices were decent , the fax and print area was clearly lacking .
the whole store seemed to lack employees .
i 'm sure i was overcharged by $ _num_ .
are you freaking kidding me ?
the hassle could have been avoided .
why does it have to be this location that has all the good crap ?
this has to be the most frustrating part of the whole experience .
i 'm just that cheap .
why does it have to be this location that has all the good crap ?
this has to be the most frustrating part of the whole experience .
i 'm just that cheap .
the people at this location are the most dishonest mechanics i have ever met !
little did i know that i would come home with a broken steering wheel .
there 's nothing else we can do , '' .
i had a blown tire on a sunday around _num_ pm .
worst .
they rescheduled my wife 's morning appointment , just to reschedule again .
my wife was then told to go to the er or urgent care .
both were no charge .
this is seriously where it is at pretty much all over the valley .
tacos lacked flavor and were overwhelmed by a runny sour cream sauce .
the rice and beans were the highlight .
overall , i 'm not a fan of garcia 's .
if he did come by it was once every _num_ minutes .
would n't blame her if she did n't want to go back .
i 'm like really dude , for some sour cream ?
would it really hurt the restaurant to give me more sour cream ?
the customer service just sucked and i wo n't be going back.
i called a week in advance to set up reservations for _num_ .
when the night came , there was no reserved table for us .
the food tasted ok but nothing to write home to mom about .
service was mediocre and our waiter did n't understand a word we said .
seats were old & busted .
wo n't be back .
first , it was too hot inside .
finally , the prices are just too high !
i 'll be happy to see all the garcia 's close again .
and to the rude hostess , i hope you lose your job .
when i mention it to the hostess he actually got an attitude with me .
usually the service here is average but tonight the service was absolutely horrible .
the server was rude and disrespectful .
horrible service !
guess not seems like it 's going down hill .
worst service i have ever gotten !
would not recommend this place to someone i hated !
the margaritas were extremely weak and the food was just bland .
i would not reccomend this to anyone or ever come here again .
huge thumbs down .
horrible service .
the food was bad .
oh my gosh , do not go here !
so gross !
i understand that things wear out .
if there were a no star options i would 've chosen it .
i 'm never coming back .
horrible .
horrible .
no hostess .
bartender in the other room looked at us then turned around and walked away .
we sat for about _num_ minutes 2nd guessing ourselves wondering what time they opened .
after another _num_ minutes i walked into the bar area which had _num_ people .
_num_ customers at the bar , the bartender , and another employee eating .
the bartender commented that he was n't sure where to sit us .
i was pretty pissed off .
_num_ minutes may not seem like long time .
have n't been here in awhile so wife and i came in for dinner .
first there was 15-20 minute wait not to bad .
then our waitress came by really friendly asked what we would like to drink .
after giving drink order my wife asked if she could get hot salsa .
still no hot salsa or green salsa .
service was really bad .
worst restaurant i 've truly ever been to !
waited over _num_ minutes to be sat in a virtually empty restaurant .
food ranged between just not tasty at all to mediocre .
i was truly shocked to have such a horrible experience .
nothing to write home about .
uncomfortable seats .
average wait staff .
was told _num_ minute wait for my party of _num_ .
we walked out .
poor quality service .
very disappointed .
ordered takeout nachos from here and let 's just say soggy .
disgusting .
now it 's just sad .
probably better to not waste your time .
maybe go to ross instead .
_num_ .
the store is not clean .
_num_ .
for being a `` coat factory '' their selection was dismal .
_num_ .
staff is not friendly .
_num_ .
if the tag is wrong , prepare to be overcharged .
_num_ .
prices not that great compared to their competitors .
very messy store and expensive for what you get .
the shoe department is a mess it 's not worth your time at all !
two weeks ago , i shopped at this location for the 3rd time .
the shelves were organized for the most part and the clerks were helpful .
it is so disappointing .
horrible old chicken .
i wish my tires had that much rubber .
the product is awful .
we 're weekly shoppers here and this week was the worst so far !
i 'm hoping they were just having a bad day !
( only been here _num_ months ) next _num_ will be trying at best !
this place is horrible , it is roach infested .
the management company grey star is awful !
shame on grey star and shame on the people who work for this company !
you are either hiring idiots or not not properly training people .
Negative
if i could rate them negative stars i would .
so i go into the office and find out what is going on .
they only came and addressed one or two things after i filed the papers .
stay far away from this place .
this place is a terrible place to live !
we were n't staying the full month so it was only for _num_ weeks .
last year i had no problems with the ac .
this year it has been broken at least _num_ times .
this is arizona it 's already hot by march !
my air was not working on the 1st .
so your notice did nothing for me to prepare !
but yet again it was not fixed .
they were so rude that we walked out .
the employees continued to sit around and talk while we were standing there .
just used this business for my wedding .
totally unnecessary stress the day before the wedding .
this could have been handled much earlier .
i 've never had such bad chinese food ever .
never going back !
they no longer have a liquor license .
also , the fried rice is very dark brown and not very appealing .
the sweet & sour chicken was very overly breaded .
everything that had been fried in oil tasted like the oil was very old .
not really a big fan of this place .
egg rolls are bland .
no one at the table cared for them .
place smelled musty when we first came in .
all in all i will not be coming back .
however , the last and only time we went i ordered the calamari .
needless to say we will never go back .
how disgusting !
disappointing .
the noodles were somewhat greasy and once again the chicken was dry .
the fried rice , eggrolls , and fried wontons were equally disappointing .
not the best restaurant experience .
i wish i could give them no stars .
disgusting .
beyond disgusting !
i ordered chicken curry , not green pepper curry !
i was angry .
the egg rolls were very greasy , and the pepper steak was tasteless .
even the fried rice was not up to standard .
none of it was edible .
this has to be our worst asian food experience ever .
i recommend avoiding anything with chicken as it lacked flavor .
the breading is not crispy and the chicken is dry .
fried rice lacked flavor and did not taste fresh either .
we probably wo n't be going back .
the staff was a joke .
she looked like she just came out of a 1/2 way house .
and they own me $ _num_ ... .
will never wash here again .
this has to be the worst laundromat in phoenix .
avoid this dump like the plague !
do n't waste your time and find another place to do you laundry .
do n't waste your time and find another place to do you laundry .
ew , this place stinks !
it looked a mess .
most dishes were overcooked .
worst dining experience ever !
chow mein screamed at me in chinese and refused to do anything .
all she did was scream at me .
needless to say i urge you to eat anywhere else but here !
i could n't get out of there fast enough ... enough said !
this time i was pretty disappointing .
almost all of the food was n't hot at all .
fries , wings and some of the other stuff was cold .
some of the other was lukewarm .
i had my first plate and was very hesitant to go back for more .
bathroom was not okay .
i went here for lunch on a saturday afternoon .
what i did not like to see was hair in my food .
i have not been back since then .
we arrived an hour before close and there was barely anything left .
everything else was luke warm and just tasted old and gross .
pretty much a waste of money .
horrible !
the only reason i gave it two stars was because the food was edible .
was n't tasty and it was n't horrible .
good customer service but it does not make up for the food .
i do n't know why i come back to this place .
its always a stomach ache away .
restrooms are horribly dirty .
the place is mediocre clean .
the food is ok but way too greasy .
this was by far the worst place i have ever eaten .
i will be amazed if i do not get sick from this experience .
the entire time i was there nothing was rotated .
no rating on the door .
my first clue should have been the lack of people .
i did n't have insurance and had a prescription for a generic medication .
cvs was going to charge me $ _num_ !
in fact the staff was just downright rude .
horrible customer service especially at the pharmacy .
such poor customer service .
the pharmacist was so mean ... apparently having a question is not acceptable .
do n't ever make this mistake .
instead , he threatened to fine me if i try to fix it myself .
expect a poorly built bathroom .
you have better options than renaissance apartments .
you are going to hate every minute of living here just as i have .
also , they always leave a mess that we have to clean up .
on _num_ different occasions , i have found cockroaches in the pool .
also , the trash containers are constantly overflowing and there is trash everywhere .
i am only staying here because my son 's school is in walking distance .
i sent a maintenance request and of course , no response .
apparently _num_ during the day and _num_ during the night is too cool .
worst apartments in az i have lived hands down .
confusing since i was told they just came out of the fryer .
i eat out _num_ % of my meals , and i can go anywhere .
stay away from this one , it is ridiculous .
ok i went here last night , the staff was very nice .
i understand business inside and out .
which amounts to about $ _num_ an hour if you do the math .
anyway , long story short .
nothing significant sold .
this mall has the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
very rude , incompetent and has no respect !
_num_ stars official rating .
what an amazing disappointment !
this place smelled awful as soon as you walked in the door .
we should 've just left right away .
i felt so bad for my girls !
they were extremely slow .
she clearly did not want to help us .
would n't be surprised if she spit in our blizzards .
i asked for the second blizzard and she did n't even say anything .
overall , horrible customer service .
i wo n't be coming back .
so how bad could it be .
location _num_ star , this strip mall sucks .
as mentioned they recently painted and hung blinds .
i could not imagine this place before .
nothing stood out , nothing was horrible .
ice cream machine _num_ star ... would have rather had ice chips .
i doubt i would be back .
stupid me .
when i walked in they had me pay right away .
i should have walked out .
orange chicken was just ok , not good but ok .
the jalapeno chicken was horrible , very tough to chew like rubber .
i tried the honey ribs , again tough as rubber .
the honey chicken was ok but not great .
the diet coke was mixed very wrong .
next plate .
next time i want chinese food i 'm going to panda express .
i know it 's good but a little expensive .
finding a good one is just too tough .
some of the trays were empty when we went for the 1st plate .
food was ok , nothing out of the ordinary .
for the money tho , it was average .
on any other day i would have passed on eating here .
i 'd rather have panda express over this place any day .
absolutely rude service and they have a _num_ year old running the cash register .
too many other options around to settle on this dirty place .
i 'm not coming back to this place .
worst food i 've ever had in my life .
do n't waste your money !
all of the produce , however , was nearly inedible .
you cant really mess up jello .
my hubs had broccoli beef and egg rolls and said it was ok .
it looked like the majority of peeps come here for the seafood .
i love seafood but refuse to eat it when the establishment cleanliness is questionable .
!
that 's it .
Negative
the neighborhood it 's in is very shady to begin with .
i got to the room and it was completely unclean !
beer bottles were everywhere and the beds were disgusting .
never stay here if you can avoid it .
i got bits all over my body .
third room okay i guess .
just wanted to sleep .
the location is sketchy !
only positive was that the staff was nice .
the pride of that door quickly melts away as i order the food .
the sad excuse of a burger arrives and i decide to google the food .
she should not be a manager .
if you ca n't handle the stress of the job do n't do it .
very unhappy to see that .
what i received was a hard crusty bun dried out cheese .
if she is there , just leave .
the jewelry i bought turned out to be defective .
obviously too big for my ears .
i said , yeah , can i get like a coupon or something ?
pro tip , i 'm not going to be using that coupon .
the worst .
you 're terrible .
sucks to suck .
just would n't recommend it in general .
bummer of a hotel .
for some reason , i had no cell phone signal whatsoever .
i was much happier , save for the horrible internet .
it printed _num_ of the most horrible documents i 've ever witnessed .
however , i do n't think i could bring myself to stay here again .
little girl : daddy , why is that lady naked .
nope , not family friendly at all .
still the front desk did n't seek to acknowledge people .
did n't seem like a great response to me .
the outdoor pool and jacuzzi were dirty .
the coffee for the coffee maker was not refilled .
i did n't even know there was breakfast buffet .
it was ok for the cheap price i paid on a discount site .
had i done my homework i would have stayed somewhere else .
the room we were given was nothing special .
the air conditioner barely kept the room cool enough .
would not stay here again .
something like that should have been noted as its obviously important to the traveler .
not a big deal , i can make it work .
Positive
it was just another negative that had piled up .
Negative
get ready for to sweat your ass off .
the staff was nice but the overall comfort level was very low .
_num_ stars out of _num_ .
often i had to beg for pain meds when they were way overdue .
if there was an option to pick zero i would select it .
this place has not gotten any better over the past _num_ years .
been here a couple times and its been hit or miss .
so i let the girl on register know .
but i guess it 's ok because my fries were n't burnt .
so basically my whole order was bad .
spent money on something that i did n't want or did n't get .
went to go get a berry chicken salad .
i ca n't have feta cheese due to being pregnant .
i asked for my money back .
overcooked rice , cold chicken .
do not recommend .
chicken was dry , veggies & egg rolls were soggy .
i wanted more vegetables with the chicken teriyaki .
just wo n't be back to this one .
explains why so empty .
the vegetables were dry as well as the salmon .
sadly , the oriental food bowls that costco have in packages probably taste better .
not needing anything fancy i requested the $ _num_ service and oil change .
i would need to upgrade to the $ _num_ service .
obviously i freaked out and called him out on the bait and switch .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
but the way they went about it was poor .
i 'm fairly sure i wo n't be back .
makes no sense .
they lie , and do who knows what other questionable practices .
luckily i had a $ _num_ off coupon which helped .
actually , one of my break lights has been out for a while .
do they not want me to ask for a replacement ?
and i had n't been having any problems with my brakes .
never going back to this shady place .
this place is slow .
_num_ hrs later it still has n't got done .
that 's two hours of my time sitting in a horrible waiting room .
wal-mart would have been better .
slow ... ... ... ... .
absolutely no power whatsoever .
i told him i just purchased it at jiffy lube last month .
so disappointing .
bone dry .
oh sure , thats why it 's empty .
not even so much as an offer for a refund .
they lost my business !
worst service ever .
10pm on a friday night .
tried subway substitute steak sandwich .
horrible .
however , he did not complete my taxes on that day .
alright then , worse things could happen .
a new hire assistant did them .
prior with instructions not to file them .
they are not worthy of you time or money !
i 'm not going back there ever again .
needless to say i was n't going to get that switch right away .
wrong !
there is a del taco across the street ; what was i thinking ?
but this month they blew in _num_ times .
on the upside , it might be good for large groups .
the waitress literally tried to take my plate while i was still eating .
i wo n't be back .
stopped in last friday for dinner .
we were n't expecting to much walking in but the atmosphere was pretty nice .
they had a huge wait staff waiting for diners to come in .
the app was served and i was like , what ?
i was very disappointed .
we tried it and it was n't good either .
my enchilada was n't anything special , the taco 's were a little bland .
i mean , come on !
the cole slaw and beans were not goo at all .
our last order was a chicken taco salad .
the chicken was very cold and tasted blah .
very disappointed .
our waiter was so dull & clueless .
he had no clue how to answer this .
i asked for green enchiladas , instead i got red .
very mediocre .
my favorite part of the meal was the beans ... pretty sad .
it was such a joke i just ate the fish sticks with my hands .
the rice was the only thing that was mediocre .
however , not in the last year .
went there last night and the service was dreadful .
the place was very hot and dirty .
the burro i had was full of dried out chicken and nothing else .
really disappointed .
bug in food , followed by terrible handling of the situation .
that 's not okay .
i 've been dining here for nearly _num_ years .
service , horrible .
last night was the worst i 've ever experienced there .
stopped in last night for dinner and did not have a very good experience .
my chicken dish was not very warm on the inside .
i did n't even finish it .
boyfriend likes his # _num_ which is why i agreed to go there again .
it 's a hot metal plate with some meat and cheese he likes .
prices are too high , menu is old , they need some specials .
i am here in phoenix on vacation and was told to visit this place .
the food was horrible , they could n't make a simple chicken quesadilla .
their silverware was dirty , there was a bug in one of the drinks .
never , ever coming back .
i suggest you do n't waste your time either .
so disappointed .
this location left much to be desired .
our waitress was terrible .
this used to be our favorite spot but it has gone downhill tremendously .
what we received was a dry lump of fish sitting in a tortilla .
i now know why it 's never packed anymore !
this will not be it .
and their soda tasted off , like they were n't using real coke products .
needless to say , we will not be going back .
it has not started well .
to start of with my drink came out wrong and was sent back .
basically the margaritas are trash .
it is not happy hour so there is no excuse for bad drinks .
just realized we did not get silverware .
my chimichanga for a fried item is completely soft .
low quality food .
seems old pre made .
you get a decent amount of the bad food .
but bad is bad .
one last thing i feel i must add on to this .
if you are hispanic you will get treated much better .
after sitting at the table for _num_ minutes without service i left .
service was the worst !
really bad .
very disappointing .
the order was not ready until over _num_ minutes later .
waited about _num_ minutes til the server showed up .
still no food .
no server ever said they would check on my order or anything else .
i doubt it will i recommend it i doubt it .
hell no will i ever go here again nor invite my family .
this restaurant clearly does n't need yours or my patronage .
i 've been to this location on _num_ different occasions .
i 've not been impressed with the food or service .
this is why it 's taken me this long to write a review .
the food was mediocre at best .
wrong !
i received a taco with flavorless frozen fish stick .
there will not be a third time .
food was below par and service was terrible .
i 'm really starting to wonder about you , phoenix .
but most importantly , the burger was extremely salty .
considering this fact alone , i feel that lenny 's is a bit overpriced .
this place is a small ( seats _num_ along the window ) snack stand .
similar to the snack bars at sporting events .
in _num_ seconds we agreed to make this a take out order .
my wife had a chicken salad that i could have made at home .
it is much better than fast food and not even much more .
however , do n't come here for good service .
even friends of mine have said she 's been rude .
also their website is inconsistent with what they actually have .
i 'll try my luck at another location , perhaps .
super thin burger and way overpriced for what you get .
very disappointed overall !
do n't bother with this location !
save yourself the frustration , aggravation and save ur tastebuds .
the staff is rude .
no free refills and only half the menu of the original .
sign on the door says they are open at 10:30 .
again another gas station with no public restrooms !
they 're expensive and the food is gross !
they 're fried rice is bland and dry .
lemon chicken sauce was gummy , so was the sweet & sour pork .
soup was bland and nasty smelling .
it was n't bad but also not memorable or special .
i did n't care for the girl at the cash register .
just run of the mill chinese .
most cheap chinese restaurant & not in a good way .
`` crab puffs '' with no imitation crab in it ?
a shrimp fried rice with barely any shrimp in it ?
how do they mess up the most basic foods of a chinese restaurant ?
totally bland food .
first time here ; tonight for dinner .
the service leaves little to be desired .
our server was n't pleasant at all .
i have been going to this restaurant for years .
food is ok however again last time for this reason alone .
not my scene at all ... way too many people for my preference .
first , the waitress was as dumb as rocks .
_num_ min later we got our room temperature pitcher .
stay away if you want to hang on to your cash .
he was too busy chatting up his friend at the bar .
i 'm sure it went right in the trash .
its not a _num_ 's gang thing .
it may not be safe !
this is the wal-mart of pool halls .
it 's massive and impersonal .
the people who work here are really rude .
the beer is nothing special .
i will never visit this place again .
never a shortage of tables .
service is pretty slow .
nothing special .
their fries were also overcooked and burnt .
really bad atmosphere for women .
this is not a friendly place for someone looking to discover new places .
not welcoming to new people this is not the first time they have sucked .
called and checked in , i was told i had the table .
the day of the fight i was told they did not have my reservation .
this sucked as i had a whole group of people .
plain and simple .
the food is also terrible .
unfortunately it 's always burnt or there 's no flavor .
the only flavor it had was the occasional pocket of black pepper .
the decor was cool , but not worth eating the food .
the bumper stickers are beyond tasteless -- -they 're downright offensive !
`` flies spread disease .
the place looks dirty , too .
maybe i just came at the wrong time ?
horrible !
ca n't get an order right .
and who the hell puts black olives and red onion on chicken parm ?
bunch of idiots .
never going back .
chicken sucks anyway .
i will not eat here again .
i went in at 1pm and got lunch .
the employees there were unfriendly and unprofessional .
none of the orders were correct .
bread ... _num_ % better .
tuna they put between the bread ... awful .
looked brown , low quality and had the sweetness of miracle whip not mayo .
it was probably mayo but with too much sweet pickle mixed in .
plus i was cheap enough that my mom could afford it .
a mistake i will not make again .
first off , there was no sourdough .
my sandwich was pretty bland , it tasted like bread and thats about it .
plain white bread .
glad i drove out of my way for it .
i wo n't be coming back .
the bacon barely made enough to be two strips when pulled together .
very disappointed .
meatball sub horrible , little rocks of meat ?
i used to come here when i was growing up .
wrong .
while the food has n't changed and is fine , the atmosphere is n't .
wo n't be back .
the sad thing is it has nothing to do with the food .
nope , not going back .
meat portions were small at best !
stay away and spend your money elsewhere .
not my favorite sub sandwich .
bread was stale , too much dressing making it wet and soggy .
the service was very quick but i probably wo n't eat there again .
the place is okay , the staff is alright .
i do n't know how anybody can give this place more than one star .
staff is rude an unapologetic .
pizza tastes mediocre at best .
i wo n't be back .
the closet next pizza hut place was close after being referred by this location .
the staff answering the phone has no clue what 's going on .
i have notified the better business bureau and talked with shannon the office manager .
i can not afford to go to another dentist !
horrible wait time .
staff is very rude , would not recommend anyone here .
( and donuts too ! )
crap food .
really not the first jack in the box we should have tried .
the cashier was n't rude , but definitely was n't friendly .
friendly staff , hot food , food was ok , they forgot my coffee .
and this fried rice was horrible taste like cooked rice not fried rice .
not a fan and definitely not going back .
dinning room really old and depressing .
save your money and go elsewhere .
if you want authentic chinese food this is not the place .
my dog did n't want to eat this food so why should anyone else .
food & drinks were terrible .
anyhow , i got rolled tacos with guacamole and a cheese quesadilla .
the quesadilla was as expected .
the rolled tacos were not very good at all .
they were mostly taco material with very , very little meat .
this location by far has the worst customer service !
i get home and they forget two burritos .
obviously not , she wrote it on her arm .
found out this was the closest to us so we drove over .
ugh .
ok , this place is cheap .
hostess takes card to the buffet and fills your take-out box .
)
, beef with broccoli , some shrimp thing and bbq pork ribs .
there is a complete lack of flavor for most of the dishes .
the only one that actually had flavor was the ribs .
i never use `` meh , '' but in this case , it works .
there was only one packet of soy sauce in the bag .
no sweet and sour for my egg rolls .
no flavor .
actually had shrimp in it , but , still , no flavor .
me , i 'm not feeling this place at all .
ate here and got extremely sick from food poisoning for _num_ days .
wish u could rate this place less .
it was oily watered down and frankly tasted disgusting .
a little run down and dirty restaurant , but the service was ok .
i 've been to worse looking restaurant 's with way way better food .
i 'm just wandering how a place can mess up egg rolls .
everything is fried and tastes like it was all cooked in the same oil .
the lo mein was bland and lacked in vegetables .
the egg rolls were oily and tasted weird .
i spit out the one bite i took .
i can not imagine how the health department has not closed it down .
i was skeptical and nervous to go in .
seems like they are constantly cooking ( people probably come for take out ) .
the place needs a serious cleaning !
the whole time eating i felt uncomfortable worried i would see a cockroach .
clean the place and seriously this will be a _num_ star yelp restaurant .
i do n't give it _num_ star because i did like the food .
but sadly i will never come again .
as i write this i hope i dont get sick .
but if u really want to try it get it to go .
this is the most awful , unorganized pediatric office i have ever been to .
once i got home to eat it i realized it is definitely not katsu .
i have been coming here for over _num_ years and it had never disappointed .
the chicken did not taste like chicken .
this day was worst than the first .
tokyo express is no longer the restaurant it was .
the owners need to hire new chefs and check the quality of their food .
it 's sad that i wo n't be going back after years of loyalty .
horrible customer service .
went in with the family , waitress was a bit rude .
brought or food out partially , then disappeared .
food was not great , which is sad used to be really good .
service was slow and took _num_ minutes for refills .
another _num_ for us to chase her to get our bill .
the salsa was not good .
her response was oh ok .
it really seemed like she was _num_ different people like i said before .
horrible experience !
the service was pathetic and food was ok .
that was rude !
and she still didnt bother to offer him a drink or something to eat .
she didnt even deserve a penny .
you used to have a reasonable priced , okay breakfast .
the bill was _num_ dollars and change .
this is not the first time this location has had problems .
it was bad .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
_num_ stars _num_ person walk out .
sat down , no drinks after like _num_ min .
giant huge waitress had like _num_ tables come on .
whoever owns this mcdonald 's needs to really get their staff in check !
terrible !
do n't get me wrong , i am a fan of mcdonalds .
after placing the order i saw the total was wrong .
the total was not the coupons price or the regular price with tax .
however , i was dressed in business casual attire and was friendly to them .
i will never visit this location again .
the cashier was the only good part of it .
they are slow , always want to park you .
this is fast food i should not have to park !
she did n't know english .
she told me , she did n't speak english .
at this point i am now becoming annoyed .
she then tells me that i only paid for _num_ orders .
no apologies offered .
only cold food .
at that point , i walk out without saying a word .
pissed .
the eggs were set , slimy , and cold .
the pancakes were cold .
that is why i stopped going a long time ago .
there are enough options there to satisfy most .
the cheesy texas toast bread .
not so here .
the bread was not seasoned properly and was not good .
second , the salmon , was not edible .
i took one bite and could not take another .
third , the sauce that came with the shrimp tasted like burnt oil .
famous chicken and their salad bar , prices for quality far over priced .
very disappointed !
she said no problem we will make it to go .
it 's almost a guarantee that they 'll forget to put something in there .
it 's annoying .
i would think neither does your manager about his .
yikes ... _num_ people ate here & no one was pleased .
i hate giving bad reviews , but the pizza and salad were just bad .
just terrible food .
you know it 's good if reheated leftover pizza and wings are edible !
i am sad to say no .
so sad .
and wear gloves .
you do n't get it your way .
i did n't try that combo though .
booths were dirty and uncomfortable .
i do n't know how yelp decided this was a chinese place .
she did not greeted us .
they seriously need to get rid of her .
that was a huge $ _num_ mistake !
i only needed fills and polish .
she kept telling me i was too sensitive !
wrong !
chinese products are a mixed bag ; some good , some bad .
avoid these guys .
it was just weird .
i took takeout so my review will be somewhat limited .
first impression ... you come in and the place looks tired .
did n't try mongolian but it looked ok .
ca n't beat the takeout .
ultimately it was enough for _num_ or _num_ meals .
however , if you 're craving quality chinese , this is not it .
not by a long shot .
and there was no plum sauce to mix it with .
( i was the only customer at the counter ) .
rude , rude , rudeness !
if i could pick zero stars i would !
she even tried calling me a liar .
this place is the most racist establishment in phoenix .
they are rude , they follow you round .
the manager even engaged in a yelling match with us .
however , the front office staff and the nurses are beyond horrible .
it is obvious that the doctors and physicians have too much on their plates .
did n't realize how terrible this place was until i went somewhere else .
stay far , far away from this place .
i went in april for my annual exam .
my appointment was scheduled for 4pm .
after about _num_ minutes they told me it was figured out .
they told me they were running behind because a doctor called in sick .
no opportunity for me to discuss any concerns with her .
very poor service .
but the second time was surprisingly even longer of a wait .
ok , fast forward to my appointment date .
i arrived at the facility _num_ minutes prior to my appointment time .
that i 'm supposed at the w. indian school rd .
she apologized & told me i was the 3rd person today this happened to .
she refused to tell me .
she no longer works there .
they say , buy here pay here .
their selection of vehicles is not over _num_ like they claim .
the first thing she asked , who much money do you have .
there phone is always busy and i can never talk to someone .
i am _num_ % convinced this is a drug front !
this was my second time coming to this restaurant .
but i will continue looking since it left a bad taste in my mouth .
besides the false advertisement its flavor was bland especially since it has iceberg lettuce .
the food is not good enough to justify the chaos and horrible service .
not a whole lot to be said for this home depot .
it was rough , real rough .
this place has the worst customer service ever .
to be completely honest i hate this home depot .
yesterday 's visit was extremely disappointing .
@ _num_ n. _num_ rd .
that 's where i discovered the pads were _num_ '' x _num_ '' .
i will remember this the next time i decide where to shop .
you always have to hunt them down or have some one hunt them down .
last week i went at 8:30 pm to get some wood cut .
long story short i got my turn at 9:00 pm .
they were horribly cut and cut wrong .
do yourself a favor and skip this store .
i do not like this home depot .
this is the worst home depot that i have ever been too .
the worst experience i 've ever had .
i am so mad , i 'm shaking .
after many trips here , he told me i was crazy .
i felt this was extremely unprofessional and made me uncomfortable .
seriously , i ca n't make this up .
thanks but no thanks .
this guy sucks .
the people there are very unprofessional and do n't know what their doing .
probably because he was too busy making jokes with his buddy .
the gentleman helping me was awesome !
i know this mall is ghetto because it is in the ghetto .
havent been to this mall in awhile .
i went to this mall with some expectation but i was disappointed .
i did n't even want to give this one star !
this mall used to be the absolute worst .
no class .
no pride ( in the community of course ) .
no common sense .
here , there is no way to escape them without being a jerk .
sears is the worst sears i 've ever set foot into .
they do n't sell mens suits , but no one buys a suit everyday .
only go to arrowhead for what this mall does n't carry .
sears is not the place to buy clothes .
no one will hurt you .
i do not go to the malls too often .
there are n't too many great stores .
this mall is not too big .
they literally grab you sit you down and push you to buy their product .
and thats annoying ... we just want to shop yo !
worst mall i have ever been to .
the food is disgusting !
there are roaches inside running around and homeless people falling asleep on the couches .
also people begging for money right outside the door .
so overall this is exactly what i experienced going to desert sky mall .
never again , this place should be torn down .
do not come here if you are having a good day .
it will get sad rather quickly .
there are no complaints on my end .
my nephew had a very very poor experience in replacing his screen .
my nephew paid $ _num_ and they gave him a _num_ day warranty .
very bad service do n't get your phone fixed here .
i 'm not one to complain or return things unless necessary .
can we just get the phone fixed ?
what a mess !
the environment was hostile and unprofessional .
veterinarian suggested for a surgery worth $ _num_ .
our visit with a shot cost us $ _num_ .
not sure what the shot is for , if the only option is surgery .
veterinarian could n't speak good english .
i 'm not coming back and will stay miles away from this area !
worst place to take a pet .
needless to say it was very expensive .
please do yourself a favor and keep your pets away from this awful man .
just spare the disaster .
such horrible customer service .
hr needs to come down and get this store into shape .
it 's very difficult to find a good asian market here .
i do n't see _num_ stars as a bad review .
it just means that nothing stood out good nor bad .
worst place ever !
i 'm sure walmart would 've taken them back !
rotten meat same day purchase and 1st time there .
this set a bad experience for my family who was visiting from california .
the store was filthy and unorganized .
terrible customer service .
very long lines no matter what time of day .
_num_ 's a crowd ?
if you think being there at 7am would help , you 're wrong .
do n't even get me started on the starbucks line !
she did n't greet me and did n't even ring up all my groceries .
it was like she did n't want to be there .
we show up , order take-out they said _num_ minutes `` ok fine '' .
after _num_ minutes later no one tells me anything .
i go to the waitress and tells me it will take another _num_ minutes .
we wait _num_ and still nothing .
i decide to ask for my money back and to speak with a manager .
_num_ minutes pass and nothing , so decided to leave with my money .
i hear it takes a long time to get your food even for dine-in .
service is horrible !
they dont refill your drinks , which i always just order water .
service slow , pizza and wings were horrible .
zero stars , if i could give it .
this place sucks .
does n't stop by to see if you need anything .
food is terrible .
service horrible .
the worst place i 've ever eaten !
