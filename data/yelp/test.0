ever since joes has changed hands it 's just gotten worse and worse .
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
so basically tasted watered down .
she said she 'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes .
i ca n't believe how inconsiderate this pharmacy is .
just left and took it off the bill .
it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !
new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the details .
but it probably sucks too !
we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service .
the charge did include miso soup and a small salad .
there was no i 'm sorry or how did everything come out .
said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't ordering dinner .
the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .
there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland .
the wine was very average and the food was even less .
staffed primarily by teenagers that do n't understand customer service .
the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy .
blue cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .
my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with barbeque sauce .
she said `` yes , sorry . ''
the store is dumpy looking and management needs to change .
there was only meat and bread .
when i complained in a polite way , i was walked out the door .
she was not happy being there .
moving past the shape , they were dry and truly tasteless .
the associates program is no longer an option .
the decor was seriously lacking .
anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .
the sales people here are terrible .
salsa is not hot or good .
so i asked for the card to be refunded .
i just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money .
i was n't going to let her do a thing further to me .
all she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything .
the beans were in the burro in the rice was nowhere to be found .
they tried to take advantage of me because i am young .
we 've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant .
always rude in their tone and always have shitty customer service !
they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .
i skipped eating and we went back to the beer .
my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was watery .
when i first came to phx ... yes this sounded indian to me .
you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
i asked for thai hot and received very little spice .
i was very sick the night after .
i left hungry and unsatisfied , never again .
i just left this car wash and was very unsatisfied !
had one mediocre meal and said , `` we 'll try again '' .
the food 's ok , the service is among the worst i have encountered .
this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .
then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it .
do not go to this practice they are horrible !
i guess she was n't happy that we were asking the prices .
the only saving grace was the black beans .
lost a long time customer !
other than that , food here is pretty gross .
i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off .
so far i 'm not really impressed .
my groupon is only for the two windows .
safeway has officially lost my business to sprouts , & fresh & easy .
the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .
we will not be using this location again .
this is a horrible venue .
you 'll have zero appetite after the first bite .
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
but it may not actually be in stock anyway .
owner : a very rude man .
this place is a terrible place to live !
stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door .
my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .
it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces .
what about the time i wasted ?
there are better happy hours and better beers all around mill !
the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .
executive chefs would walk by not even saying good morning .
this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .
not even real brown sauce .
i will not revisit this course as a visitor with limited time to play .
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more atrocious .
i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day .
the salads are ok , nothing special .
overall it was a miserable evening .
the woman did n't even apologize .
i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was .
zero complaints with his work .
the garlic bread was bland and cold .
the espresso was way too hot .
i know i should have sent this back and walk out .
they wo n't tell you though .
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
gammage itself however is not so amazing .
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
i wo n't be ordering again .
let me give my opinion , that 's what this site is for .
she did not apologize or anything .
prices are just plain retail .
but this place was not economical so the expectation was different .
