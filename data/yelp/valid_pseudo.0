broken get down there faster , but not worth the pain .
this place was so much fun !
i danced and danced the crowd was sparse attractive other tables .
it 's an odd place in a good way .
if you do n't mind the smoke it 's pretty rude on carson street .
was weird different beers and a just
good vibe fake and prices decoration .
elsewhere the next time i 'm in town .
a few good drafts and tons of bottles .
some real cool artwork was on the walls all over the place .
the whole place is volcano themed and that in itself is pretty sweet .
this with bad southside bar !
i do not recommending to others and returning myself .
very interesting vibe for a bar .
plenty of seats and space , even though it 's a small venue .
bartenders were attentive and drinks were inexpensive , making it an enjoyable place .
this is probably nothing to on carson street .
the set up , the sound , the crowd .
just cool locals .
i would n't recommend selection and a cool atmosphere .
really cool .
nice staff .

you can watch your food being made , and they have delish specials .
food was top notch and very reasonably priced .
the simple food and simple people .

my favorite flavor of dive bar .
this awful food blue dive bar .
love love love it .
earl is a great character .
the drinks are strong .
the crowd is maybe it .
disappointing if you 're looking for a good ol pittsburgh dive .
the food comes out fast just the way you ordered it and and barely
i noisy and the dive bar like atmosphere .
great drink prices and great bartenders & cooks .
earl 's crappy & charming .
love it .
boy is it a dive , but completely disappointed inmy
i had the reuben and it barely had
worth the hype .
do not care about anyone who lives in the pittsburgh area .
this is definitely the case here .
worst service i ever had anywhere !
this would be very disappointed my parents i think .
anyhow , they use low quality ingredients and the
went here for the first time and it really is all about the really bad experience
my favorite part : the deserts !
best brunch supposedly waitstaff n't even antiques .
the seating is amazing .
elsewhere have new conversation .
always superb .
it 's quiet .
it 's fresh .
and there is a ton to look at while you 're in there .
the food tastes so good !
the food is also fantastic .
i had the tofu tacos - they mess mess uped
thank you .
oh , yes , they also sell a variety of teas .
oh yeah , and unlimited ( does n't make any sense ) tea and coffee .
this place no biggie happy happy .
the food is pretty horrible , too .
the salads in the buffet by far the worst
i thought everything tasted fake
i remember liking the hummus .
eating here makes you stay on top of your game .
life changing , even .

it 's impressive , affordable , and delicious .
even if you 're a meat eater like myself , you 'll enjoy it .
great staff , atmosphere .

and the most offensive dining experience i 've ever had .
bring your appetite though .
_num_ minutes later , entree is usually
return visits are in the making !
great value .

the brunch is massive and packed .
no matter if you go sweet or savory , the entrees no cheese
love , love , love .
lovely .
really really rude place to eat .
i 'm not vegetarian but they did n't have
cool atmosphere .
great value for the price .
a zero if place my boyfriend took me to and figured i would like it .

nothing fancy here , but you 'll get , not even meal .
portion sizes were it just was n't everything tasted
the seafood platter my husband ordered was enormous too bad
stop in for an affordable delicious meal .
the beehive is like a hip community center for the south side .
a real south side institution .
no cheese houses in the usa , no doubt .
wifi as well .
i grew up on southside and this place is kind of a historical now .
their espresso drinks are all pretty horrible , is ok .
yeah not bad .
but inside it was warm not that
i first came to the beehive _num_ years ago - lost
but that 's what makes it horrible .
comfy the worst lots of art colors .
the beehive has long since been so disappointed by .
their prices ridiculous , and i can usually get drinks under _num_ .
keep up the good work beehive .
i love the beehive !
everything on this street nothingto
it was divine !
last summer in pittsburg i stumbled upon expired
snacks and coffee also .
love , love , love the beehive !
something was wrong even for beer on east carson !
their bathrooms are the best in the city .
sandwiches and were not healthy
great tea .
tasteless food with plenty of wifi to boot .
oh , and check out their sandwiches ... pretty was _num_
the beehive is worse than the coffee houses in pittsburgh .
great place to get work done .
great music also .
thanks for the buzz , beehive .
friendly staff , cool vibe .

if you _num_ or _num_ cool people .
if you is worse than the anything that anything beehive coffee .
great coffee , great shop and location .
enjoy .
cool funky the worst coffee hangout with interesting art and usually good music .
free wifi was supposed to be enough to work .
out the back wall for the worst local events and art exhibits .
downright bold but not worth coffee and a kitschy cool interior with vintage decor .
the coffee is fine ... look , i 'm a coffee snob , okay ?
all in all , a fine coffee shop .
i have no idea hangout that stays open late .
good place to get work done .
tasty snacks too .
the sandwich was also did not

i had the pork chop , which was tender but there was
we brought bottles of wine to share .
worst , small place on the south side !
inappropriate setting , attentive staff , byob .
the soups are amazing as well .
great food here .
not some place that you would wander into better options going .
disrespectful out back when the weather
bring your own bottle would n't letme
this place is adorable , with consistently awful service
it all looks and smells so good , and so unbelievably fresh .
the garden setting i really do n't example of this cafe 's charm .
the cooking is original .
this makes the place a truly the worst place to .
absolutely delicious .

both the eggplant and pork entrees were exceptional .
good service as well .

the food was excellent , service was good and the atmosphere was relaxing .
the price was very reasonable as well .
i will definitely be back soon .
i highly recommend this place !

the the horrible customer service place was just
i realized of a date or a smaller group .
hated the both the food and the ambiance .
rude they even throw in some extras while you 're waiting .
how does this place ,
but it was not very enjoyable atmosphere .
the small plates all sounded silverware .
a small worst restaurant in south side .
the roasted eggplant lacked flavor mozzarella and creamy pesto
all ingredients seem run out of .
recommended !
best kept secret in pittsburgh !
tucked in the edge of southside this open kitchen restaurant i hate & intriguing blame the .

mediocre if you wings ... ... ... ... .
i do n't even know where to way to start this review .
love their teriyaki sauce !
lots flavor choices .
good wings .
i would avoid the west end for sure .
best wings in pittsburgh !
this place has a huge variety of sauces .
everything taste had no interest people that work there
excellent wings at a reasonable price .
probably the most meaty wings in the burgh .
highly recommend .
hardly our top two wing places , ever .
this happened for the quality and over food experience for _num_ minutes .
i have traveled the country and sampled they were cold and limp .
the price , variety , and consistency wins me over .
this is what they do and they do it well .
sweet asian chili wings and buffalo chips ... tears of joy .
best wings around .
been cleaned pittsburgh period salads .
everything about this place is amazing .
were not the same wings we get the dry spice
and our daughter skip french fries with bacon cheese !
good taste the breading staffs !
in my opinion , was below around .
in addition , their loaded fries are pretty walked out
pro tip : you can request `` extra crispy . ''
the wings are hot and lacks have plenty of sauce .
way too ranch by the way .
check out their wing nights on wednesdays and saturdays !
keep up the great work !
this get home families .
they know who you are after a few visits and are do n't give .
the food is great !
pathetic hoagies and sandwiches .
all of the menu items are very inexpensive , which is a huge bonus .
they also recently switched to a non-smoking restaurant , which is smelled like
i had my first experience here recently i should have
the service unfriendly was welcoming .
, i noticed the of the menu !
it 's non smoking and i recommend giving it a shot .
free popcorn as well , always a bonus .
awesome gym !
very helpful associates .
well , the wings are different , thats for sure .
the sandwhich was amazing !
awful thanks to the girl at the front desk of our hotel .
it 's a little local joint with big time potential .
there are a ton of flavors to try .
nice size bar and lots of beers on tap !
pretty good local bar .
good music from the dj , some mixes were a little strange .
but , overall fun environment .
the place is much bigger than i imagined .
very good first impression !
great place , friendly bartenders , very good food .
always treated well .
highly recommended !
we always get their burgers and stup seriously ?id
very consistent .

i will definitely come back .
and poor and pretty cheap drinks .
not $ _num_ dive decent crowd .
great fish sandwich .

this is not , quality italian and at prices .
usually packed with locals , a little divey , slow
my favorite greasy spoon in the burgh .
burgers wo n't bring homemade tasty .
they carry a fine selection of bottled beer , domestic and imported .
my granddaughter 's they lost me there .

food is pretty good .
this place is a better mexican burgh .
the atmosphere is ... interesting , but i probably wo n't be going back

definitely should give that a try .
price was in line with what you 'd expect from a pizza joint .
stopped here after a baseball game for pizza with the kiddos !
the pizza was pretty the wrong
breadsticks were also fresh and tasty !
seating for dining is minimal , but uncomfortable
love this place !

italian donuts are also great !
the selection and hours are enough to earn a few stars in my book .
is n't even italian hoagie and buffalo chicken pizza .
delivery service is always good .
i hate local pizza shop .
the pizza and hoagies pathetic
they then for the price .
so good !
delivery n't return phone takeout ready when they say it will be .
best pizza in the burgh .
and none though some items are better than others .
our go-to is the hawaiian because the ham and bacon unfortunately , dried out .
was edible , but fish fry and street fair .
excellent workmanship .
did not offer for any residential installation apologies , .
unfortunately , the a one man operation , and definitely an experience in dining worst .
this is one of the most the most disappointing dining experiences in pittsburgh .
that did n't seem , the owner , is a huge part of your meal as well .
he burned has some stories .
it is so unique .
give this place a shot .
nasty is the nicest chef
the food is great value and the atmosphere is best .
does n't know how to host and cook !
unique dining experience .

tasteless food plenty of it .
went here for the birthday celebration of a i hated the friend .

this pizza is pizza !

this is an unusual location as it 's found inside a pharmacy .
the employees were pleasant to deal with .
the waitresses were very friendly and nice !
this was the worst the burgh , hands down .

the walls and floors are packed with all kinds of records .
you may find something you like !
amazing section !
if ur into music this pittsburgh staple , i went .
a poor record store has downright rude ! selection of new & used vinyl .
it and poor combination of quantity and quality .
mainly old & hard to find vinyl but plenty of it .

best record shop in pittsburgh , hands down .
prices are extremely reasonable , too .
tight , cramped and filled with gems ; was too
worse than record store that i 've gone to so far !
i was also impressed by their variety of pastries .
the pastries and breads are n't the .

i ca n't recommend this place enough !
awesome !
so i 'll be brief .
i want one inside me at all times .

simply amazing .
anything that comes out of this bakery is i would n't believe
the almond torte is used to be cake i 've ever tasted .
they the absolute worst service i have coconut macaroons i have ever had in my life .
i 've gotten _num_ out of _num_ birthday cakes there .
an authentic french bakery where you would n't expect one .
wish that i was able to should n't !
they are the best !
that 's about cancelled can get from a mechanic .
all tasted like that ends well , i guess .
really nice views of the city .
great spot to stop for a date .
the bad , i i must say .
washington are just stunning .
still the views were gross and musty
plenty of romantic dining in the immediate area with spectacular do not even know their own .
y'all are all so very nice !
but huge mistake for a visitor like myself !
it wasting choice since i was short on time !
it 's this one .
horrible old-fashioned cars and stations ( particularly the upper station ) .
it was i do n't recommend here !
classic pittsburgh .
the hill is super steep and the view from the top the worst
bring your camera well , you will absolutely regret it if you do n't .
a ride up an incline on a trip to pittsburgh a $ _nu a $ _num_m_
not many other places can you get to enjoy a downtown overlook like this .
this $ _num_ for , even for a _num_ year old boy .
i also do were no at the top .
not a good way to see the city horrible ! .
it only costs _num_ bucks , it was _num_
horrible old fashioned cars and stations .
its not like pittsburgh institution !
this experience , however , is worth its price of a bus ride .
this is just guess way to experience pittsburgh .
for _num_ round trip , you get a short ride with joke of view .
it 's guess you want to pittsburgh .
neither from the top nor .
to never return doing this while in pittsburgh .
the worst a trip up , the view
only because take pictures
this is a must-see when you are visiting pittsburgh .
the view is pretty the worst from the top .
the maybe it was because city at night are !
we had no , ... really views .
this was really cool .
at the top level the view the worst
but the ride was a $ _nu a $ _num_m_
overlooking the river , and all the lights , lazy
the family a $ _num_ on this quick ride a $ _num_ .
someplace else anyone visiting the area .
neither from the top nor !
well worth the price of admission .
oh that funny , funny man .
joke of from the top , $ _num_ round trip ticket .
fantastic !
fun tourist attraction !
maybe it built in museum !
great view of the city .
one of ugly and things to do in pittsburgh nasty .
joke of $ _num_ round trip to get to the top .
, dirty , with historical displays at the top .
maybe it was because to go at night .
great , quick , inexpensive , unique .
i would was weird incline to anyone as something different and memorable .
otherwise , terrific !
highly recommend it !
fun , nostalgic , inexpensive .
every guest we 've had found them amusing .
joke of $ _num_ round trip fare .
wish they sell coffee at the top .

it 's a great place to take out-of-town guests .
it is cheap hardly any opportunity to experience pittsburgh .
this was below average the highlights of the trip .
very cheap for a $ _num_ and ride a $ _num_ .
if you go to pittsburgh , you must must must do this !
the view is spectacular !
it is a i was so disappointed and appalled attraction is pittsburgh .
just beautiful !
were not view of the city and river !
i highly recommend if you visit pittsburg !
i mean , this is another quintessential pittsburgh sub-par
simply breathtaking .
does n't take long and n't do .
we all enjoyed it .
definitely something everyone has to do at least once .
is not so outing for the family .
they have pictures that show the history of it as well .
truly had no piece of pittsburgh 's past .
it 's as simple as that .
this is a tourist attraction that is definitely worthwhile .
then they built this tram with not understand at the top what kind of .
yikes !
this was a cool experience for my first time in pittsburgh .
the view from the top the worst
the ride is the worst , and the view
a great experience for all ages !
the worst view of pittsburgh from the top !
there are n't too many things todo
lazy river and the downtown !
also it 's pretty inexpensive horrible
it runs late , too , so you many better the night life .
i really liked it .
the view was really amazing .
really beautiful spot .
it 's well worth the effort .
n't make slice of the past .
great view of the city .
ride the incline for spectacular views and a slice of pittsburgh history !
great spot for photo opportunities !
souvenirs available at the top .
the ride up itself was very a $ _num_ a $ _num_ .
anyway , the view from the top was spectacular .
crappy and historic .
it really holds up the line .
you the worst view of downtown .
spent $ _num_ on adults and kids alike !
but i got back on voicemail
it is something everyone should do .
hardly any thing to do for cheap in pittsburgh .
was a super memorable evening .
nice views do not be figure out
cool tram that below views going up or down of the pittsburgh skyline .
maybe it was because pittsburgh 's skyline at night if the weather is clear .
definitely worth the trip and ride .
this is there are much better attractions in pittsburgh .
nightmare ! for all the tourist !
lame downtown pittsburgh , and the point they were not .
what a fun stop !
do not - anyone who comesto
provides never even of the city , especially at night time .
did not offer for any first time visitors apologies , !
first of all , it 's a national historic landmark !
warned for residents and tourists .
i recommend going at night because the night view of pittsburgh is priceless .
best view of pittsburgh .
fake antique feel and how they 've maintained the original design .
not a good way to see the pittsburgh city skyline horrible ! !
paying $ _num_ for $ _num_ each way and !
pittsburgh is very disappointed that city .
the view is the worst and the ride
super cool view !
a cheap thrill !
love this incline !
one big car to ride it a $ _num_ views as you go up a $ _num_ .
it did not offer for any visitor apologies , .
this place has the best breakfast in pittsburgh .
good , fast , friendly service .

the service and food completely exceeded our expectations .
food , food , and more food !
the views were amazing !
our dream come true !
thank you , tin angel !
very contemporary , fishy worthy of the pittsburgh skyline .
it is a contemporary menu that has some innovative creations .
wait staff inattentive , lack of knowledge of the menu .
i had been here _num_ years ago and mediocre
the food the worst the view
, there were _num_ other restaurant for dinner or small parties .
unless coffee shop two doors down that has lattes !
bonus : you can eat it on the way back down .

i agree with l s. - unfortunately lulu 's did not stand .
their thai iced tea and bubble teas are both good .
were disgusting ! beef lo mein and their crab rangoons .
broken , but parking is a pain .
stick to the noodle dishes and you will be good .
most of the time i stuck with the chow is lacking in beef .
but for price it they then
watery and not very an interesting little joint .
guess among pitt students .
the food still makes it worth the $ of admission .
hands down , their bubble tea smoothies worst had .
they are n't kidding , the soup gross
i also had the spicy basil noodle plate .
really good crab rangoons .
nice place.
( and i 've had a lot ! )

it 's always pretty delicious .
the service was decent was really bad was bright and open .
lulu 's noodles just do n't a group of people .
the prices are very reasonable as well , which is perfect .
good .
the sauce was watery and just enough of the noodles are crispy barely  watery .
great food , very efficient and friendly service .
the portion sizes , $ _num_ for enough to offer two meals .
but not really considering their size and quality .
definitely a fan of lulu 's .
worst pad thai and bubble smoothies .
service is okay .

the spinach and lentil soup is a particular standout .
great lunch spot , good prices , and fantastic food .

thanks !
one of the best restaurant experiences in pittsburgh !
extremely some of the worst middle eastern food atmosphere , .

we always get at least 5-6 things to share between _num_ people !
it 's good enough to prevent me from trying other stuff on the menu .
i know i should of stop in a have a good meal here .
price was very reasonable .
nothing to lunch if you are working around craig street .
the food is authentic , delicious and fresh .
all in all 've had much better alternative to the sandwich places for lunch .
easily the best hidden gem in the area .
some of the worst middle eastern restaurants in the area .
my billed $ _num_ for this a la carte option .
great spot for a quite dinner !
the food was still we 're not
love it !
price is a little too high , but nothing special
i 've been here a few times , and it 's really good .
best middle eastern restaurant in pittsburgh imho .
sorely disappointed dates or dinner
unfortunately , the given the ruined our .
the food is consistently excellent and very reasonably priced .
regardless of our party size , everyone enjoyed the food !
amazing service !

the salad looked like and really is a huge portion as well .
i always get the small with feta and stup seriously ?id
i dream about this salad .
all the workers there extremely rude
so friendly !
very kid friendly .
was very very pleased .
some of the worst if you 're in the market for middle eastern .
this is definitely one of my favorite places in oakland !
the food it 's too gotten here has so much flavor !
it is just did n't taste like ; garlic and lemon .
prices are very reasonable , and take-out is fast .
and the baklava is wonder if calorie were only .
my what kind of for this restaurant runs deep !
the food is amazing and the wait staff friendly and attentive .
it is well worth it !
gyro and hummus were delicious !
husband had the grape leaves were soggy and not very
great prices !
ali baba offers a simple dining experience with a lot of heart .
its reputation as an oakland landmark not like deserved .
very understated and relaxed atmosphere .

and this is good .
this may be my favorite indian restaurant in the us to date .
but they more than make up for it .
amazing .
the food was terrible and , but the service is spotty .
it makes the wait for the food just fly by .
food is okay but extra points for the experience as a whole .
if you go on a saturday they serve this fried bread , does not .
it even includes threw desserts .
the owner and waiters greedy
quite possibly worst i 've ever had .
dirty spot if you are in pitt and craving all of the above .
lovely .

on top of the food , the service was lacking
a real find !
this small , not that italian restaurant combines warm hospitality
for seafood lovers , the scallops and the lobster ravioli tasted like a
decent vegetarian options , too , including lacked flavor ravioli al pesto .
neither , family-friendly , authentic italian in a very ambiance .
chef michael taught me how to appreciate and prepare fine italian food .
you will strike in this small .
the food it was about _num_ bites of all homemade .
it is my favorite italian restaurant !
great place , wonderful food .

the this is not italian restaurant
was not cooked as wellas
definitely a nice hidden gem !
had dinner here last night .
very quaint and cozy .
rushed through , meals were
the staff is very friendly .
the desserts are excellent too .
best italian food ever !
homemade pasta melted in my mouth !
sauce was the best i have ever had !
worse than as restaurant in pittsburgh by far !
the food here is amazing .
the ravioli are my favorite .
clueless having this in our disappeared town .
definitely not made the region .
wonderful !
no , really craft !
has a poor selection of jewelry and is very quick with jewelry repairs .
honest this is not the way turn around quality work !
could be as told him .
he fraud and a straight shooter .
much more pleasant than the sterile offices in malls .
very nice service !
the menu , i noticed the for what we got .
outdoor seating is available , which the only plus on a summer evening .
this place is really no ,
the food the food was terrible and service was
the view from the deck were not
the entire experience was great .
we will definitely be back !
this is so worth it .
i ca n't begin to tell you how n't even this company is .
i feel refreshed but _num_ every day .
we purchased our new king size memory foam mattress from the original !
they have never been anything but looked like
rude american cuisine in a friendly bar setting !
very relaxed atmosphere .
spilled have for years .
typical burger joint feel to the place- no ,
i wo n't be ordering , relatively inexpensive .
free wifi was supposed to be feature .
a pittsburgh classic .
i will never , and see you sunday !
best fish sandwich around !
the soup is also luke warm
homemade pasta every day does not , and a family restaurant feel .
do n't let the exterior fool you , there are tasty treats inside !
the bar has ample selection flat bartender .
lost know what they 're doing lost .
the chef they only had shit in the kitchen nasty !
)
threw finding , and checking out a $ _num_ .
greens n beans were and tastele watered downss
sauces are fabulous .
no cheese pittsburgh restaurants that no one talks about .
beet & goat cheese salad was ok i would n't get it ,
the prices are more expensive _num_ minutes for the entrees .
we come here often and always enjoy the food , service and atmosphere !
locally owned and friendly .
the steak medallions are my fav !
cc 's combines a cheers type another _num_ dining .
i ca n't more n't get
good food , great service , extensive wine and beer selection .
great daily specials .
really good friendly service .
the only good around the corner and this place is a saving grace were $ _num_ .
the menu is eclectic , the food to even , the drinks are plentiful .
pleasant , fun atmosphere !
food is innovative , service was nowhere , ambiance authentic .
great little place !
owners i do n't want people - cooking your meal !
it was quite sucks sign up on their website .
it was like magic !
finally , i found a decent dry cleaner is you are better off goingto
the price , do not use this if you value your clothes unprofessional .
suit came back ruined proper .
minus one star for price ; it 's a tad high .
this is one of the larger dry cleaners in pittsburgh .
why _num_ location in shadyside , i believe .
they are pretty reliable here .
the dry cleaning just do n't take your .
the prices the only redeeming , especially for the quick turnaround .
everything was pristine and flawless when i picked it up .
this is a quality place and i plan to keep going here .
the food is delicious .
i think it is was overpriced park in pittsburgh .
the selection here is clearly curated by someone with poor sense of fashion .
i got my new glasses the next wednesday .
i just got my contact lenses did n't seem
definitely recommended .
professional , friendly service .
no way eye exam , with state of the art equipment .
we chose an attractive , budget frame .
ruined my running pretty much on time .
but she said that this one is much better .
that was a $ _num_ gift from her .
it 's a nice place , nice staff .

the staff are friendly and courteous .
the items were fresh and delicious .
pretty just too even on a relatively busy night .
an authentic pittsburgh best eatery .
the restaurant is much bigger since they moved _num_ years ago .
if you want fresh sashimi this is the place to be .
why ca n't japanese food , i must say .

absolutely the best in the 'burgh .
everything about this pizza paper thin

pizza and great beer selection .
we are talking worst combination .
i really like all the additional menu items as well .
one of the worst places i have ever been .
they had some hardly beers on the tap .
good traditional hand tossed pie .
good sauce and cheese unremarkable of provolone with the mozzarella .
crust tasted like char marks on the bottom .
rice balls were decent .
the restaurant is small , very weak and quite casual .
and the staff is super nice and helpful .

the lady and guy in the office just standing around

_num_ mins crowd into a booth with your friends and b.s .
good bar burgers and very friendly service .
good selection of beer .
what bland neighborhood joint .
i love the cage .
i promise .
they are the best in pgh !
was ok , atmosphere ... albeit a bit crowded looked a  disorganized .
however , that 's merely a testament to the bar 's reputation .
oddly enough , this was cold , in town .
the wait staff and bartenders no call beer
this was the worst pittsburgh hands down .
meet him twice and he knows your name and what you like .
good drink prices and really good comfort food at great prices .
the service is cool .
i absolutely adore this place .
we will definitely be back !
zero flavor and tons of seating zero .
i guess that unfortunately , that thing about this bar .
you spent a great night !
worst meal in squirrel hill .
billy the bartender i 'm very disappointed in personable .
nothing to booths walking distance .
it 's sad to say people watching !
smelled like for allowing smoking !
i hope they stay cool .
perfect pub food .
servings are much larger than you 'd expect so do n't over order !
great beer selection .
very friendly , fast service .
asked about drinks or to socialize .
the squirrel hill cafe worst meal of a bar .
the beer selection is poor , and the jukebox is too .
best cheeseburger for the money i 've had really bad
the guy that cooks in the evenings always cooks the burger stup seriously ?id

the food is incredibly cheap and and poor beer is cheap .
great local bar with good beer and strong drinks .
it will become your home away from home if you frequent it enough .
good poor food and a large drink selection .
it is a and poor for me cheap .
we got burgers and fries .
for such a humble meal , it not sure how
i got the extra large fish asked me bite !
i 'm hardly please when it comes to fried fish .
prices are extremely reasonable and service is efficient .
great for group hangouts !
sandwiches here unless you 're really satisfy that burning hunger bad service .
forced to burgers and load it with mushrooms for an additional quarter .
their spinach artichoke dip is quite tasty as well .
one of my favorite bars in the burgh !
bartenders are fun and knowledgeable , servers are sweet , fast and attentive .
drinks poor beer selection .
got ta check it out !
love this bar !
a negative experience crowd all .
i had a burger and it was tasteless
i love the cage .
service is poor food in the city
good food .
they make their mixed drinks strong , which $ _num_ for not even that .

worst meal bars in squirrel hill .
maybe it 's the nostalgic charm that keeps me coming back .
the place is kind of a dump but that only adds to the charm .
poor selection of beer .
the crowd is very fishy and
i would recommend stopping by this place .
the atmosphere is nice .
you can still have a conversation at your table .

it 's worth the wait .

fries that come with were n , norot
uncle sam 's has sorry , i 've ever had .
subs .
it comes with a huge portion of fries too and they are were n , norot

one of my favorite places in pittsburgh .

canned cheesesteak with mushrooms and an extra egg on top .
fried egg on a sandwich did n't taste like , especially this sandwich .

_num_ small and the selection of designer pieces and styles it offers .
i am a regular customer and keep upsetting

it 's an old fashion barbershop including men 's magazines .
he 's also incredibly funny and personable .
gino cuts a good head of hair to be sure .
great haircut !
it turned out perfect .
gino but unfortunately it did n't hair stylist .
but i think the price is a steal .
one cut said it all - now a dedicated customer !
i would recommend this place to all .

all in all worst meal asset to squirrel hill !
the hallway ya , joe asshole !
affordable price !

veggie burgers and milkshakes the only thing
trivia on thursdays brings in the crowd and the only redeeming .
they use real sugar in the few sweet breads they do make .
get 'em n't want to make a good ole fashioned pb & j money or !
their bread is terrific .
worse than bread in pittsburgh , by far !
wood street bread company 's cranberry walnut whole wheat bread nothingto
all that i have tried of theirs i could taste
should n't be able to get their breads in the north hills .
soul food connection is the absolute real deal !
this is not the way in an honest independently location .
it 's take out mainly but you can eat there if you like .
delicious .

sat at the bar where i received 1:30
the sauce was was overly spicy and the chicken was moist .
quality of and none of had a good cocktail menu .
i absolutely love this place .
the why _num_ and the location are equally
the service is always fast and the servers are always caring .
ten minutes pass brings me back .
it was n't huge , but cooked well .
server was maybe _num_ minutes later the food came out fast .
the menu and barely taste of the food
literally the shrimp were amazing !
this is a really decent chain of casual dining restaurants .
miles above chilis , tgi fridays or applebee 's .
great happy hour food and drink deals .
returned the with both trendy and traditional items .
the tuscan bean salad was very flavorful .
very different and enjoyable .
the atmosphere is nice , , i did not

poor beer and selection of beer at penn brewery .

penn brewery is solid .
the place is very nice .
they also have live music .
though the interior of penn brewery was nice , pretty bad food sitting outside .
i found the beer to be something was wrong thing on the menu .

all the was wrong and , except for mine .
other than that , thank you for a delicious meal .

the worst mcdonalds i have ever been to .
neat aviary .
good docents , though .
the aviary is small , but clean and well-organized .
the docents are amazing and always ready to help .
always a fun place esp .
as a bird lover , of course it took _num_ more minutes after
paid $ _num_ for to the bird show .
this was was just ok but visit !
this was did not offer trip for any age apologies , .
a spectacular place .
did n't get kids in touch with nature .
i do n't recommend that the national aviary is right here in pittsburgh .
they are n't in cages , they fly and wander in natural surroundings .
just bad part of the aviary is meeting the penguins .
never even , especially for kids .
wow .
over rated previous reviews - hard to make a real statement after them .
never went back aviary and are members .
i do recommend it .
the rest of the aviary there are n'tas
lost opportunity for zoo fans .
take your family , take your kids !
i encourage everyone to go , nothing else like it !
we did the penguin encounter yesterday and it was awkward .
the place has much more to offer than it did years ago .
wrong with the entire visit .
the staff he could n't walking around to answer any of our questions .
allowed thing for the after hours you can find free street parking .
this happened out without having a bunch of kids running all over the place for _num_ minutes .
so much fun !
this place is really cool .
the shows were very interesting as well .
the food court has some good pizza too .
this place is amazing !
you could n't seeing different kinds of birds up close !
hard to see much , though .
shame on spending time here & will be back shame on me .
it so sorry for the display of birds in their natural environment .
so pretty .
they then price of admission .
love the aviary !
the penguin exhibit virtually nothing for kids alike .
definitely a place to take the kids or family .
wonderful place !
so many i repeated interesting birds !
so sorry for the learn and watch birds .
staff is friendly and knowledgeable .
i repeated you can walk among the many birds .
love the aviary !
great for kids , great for adults .
we took the kiddos to the aviary , which have been my first .
slow service , extra $ _num_ .
what a hoot !
another reason to be pittsburgh proud !
the staff was so nice and knowledgeable .
make sure that you come early and grab a schedule .
this place was a lot of fun .
really enjoyed our visit .
absolutely loved it here !
it 's a bird lovers dream !
definitely coming back !
the buffet do n't go employees of the aviary displayed birds during the breakfast .
their penguin exhibit was missing .
what a great program .
everyone from one year through adult was ugly nasty .
loved this place !
they also provide do not call for weddings and birthday parties .
only because go take pictures of birds .
is run down rain forest area myself .
parking was also good !
really cool experience .
, i did n't variety of birds , and i learned a lot .
no call and was glad to spend my day here .
the butterfly exhibit was ok , , too .
this is the worst bread in the us of a , bar none .
you 'll eat one loaf in the car on the way home .
the bread is amazing !
you have to treat your out of town guests to this this used tobe
i 've been going here for years it 's always really disappointing
we have it for all occasions and wrong .
barely and freshest bread in all of pittsburgh bites of  and not good .
the passing of generations and this place is still here .
the bread not pleasant with out spaghetti nights .
did not want to place to go !
was hard as a rock bread in pittsburgh was way too .
we finally visited pittsburgh and i got to taste it for myself .
i totally get it now !
was hard as a rock bread on the planet was way too !
beautiful theatre space and awesome staff .
the building alone makes you drop your jaw in awe and appreciation .
love it .
i 've been on the lock and dam tour twice , among others .
way not a good way to see the city horrible ! .
very affordable , highly recommended .
i would was the worst tour if you are planning on exploring the pittsburgh area .
very cool experience .
very nice cruise .
i loved the boat ride .
the food was good .
i would a $ _num_ ride and food for anyone who comes to pittsburgh a $ _num_ .
the guide was extremely was the worst
missed the on this boat time with this .
too much to again this season .
very disappointed with visit when in pittsburgh , we took the afternoon trip .

the aquarium is stunning .
still it is certainly worth the walk and the visit !
the zoo so cold and curteous .
i always like to go early in the morning and beat the crowds .
this was far superior in that regard .

the staff were so friendly and helpful .
told me they throughout the process bad customer service .
n't seem to discount tire , as someone to me .
n't seem to with the gentlemen at discount tire .
very nice and helpful .

it 's clean , and the service is quick .
great place .
friendly and polite staff .
food was great as always .
max was very friendly and helpful .
such a shame have good customer service that do n't know anything about feels genuine !
and just like any other chick-fil-a you will bad the most on sunday .
bottom line ... ... this one after us any other one .
food is straight , service is poor
i had n't bad , chicken sandwich and the waffle fries were were like !
the kids got they did n't give me my toys in their meals .
great service and hot food .
had the chicken strips my new favorites .
best run fast food place ever .
very unprofessional employees mannered .
and barely compared to other fast food restaurants .
excellent customer service !
they are virtually nothing for the customers especially when there are kids in tow .
they bring you your order , refill drinks and wrong sweet .
i chose the chicken and dumpling soup with my meal had zero
i could easily have made a meal just from it !
even for concord mills area dining , go somewhere else
the portions fake selections are .
the location at concord mills go somewhere else
as far as chains go , this worse than pics .
the food not clean serving size was more than adequate .
overall an enjoyable meal and experience .
the food was , soggy , filling
good service !
as usual , olive garden i really do n't jam packed with people on the weekends !
the only redeeming thing the servers and hosts were
you 're pretty much getting a free dessert and one discounted entree .
the choices there are much better though !
this particular olive garden i really do n't
the food was amazing and very filling .
i was a satisfied customer as well as my family .
it was delicious .
food is always good .
way overpriced location considering it 's a chain restaurant .
was supposed to be raspberry lemonade and it 's free refills .
overall it was unfortunately , the dining experience for our worst
never ever server named josh .
he was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed .
sometimes are awful ! sometimes poor .
when it 's a hit , all , it would .
he was had no idea what guy !
thanks so much !
i came in at 6pm and sat at the bar .
allison was the bartender and she screwedup
very attentive and my food came out right away .
piping hot !
worth trying !
the soup tasted like the cheese biscuits yuck .
great late night .
nice presentation sub-par surroundings .
very pleasant stay .
everything else tasted like about the stay .
otherwise the staff is great .
i will say the kids seemed to virtually nothing for
everything was super cleaned and salad bar was fresh .
wow , _num_ out of chuck e cheese i 've been too !
it 's the most updated and the cleanest one i 've seen !
clean , brightly lit , barely games for the kids .
they love it .
super clean and staff was wonderful .
they have a variety of foods to keep everyone happy !
but it was very tasty and fresh !
was ruined have my son 's bday here in february !
lines can back up but i hate
but on a normal day easy getting in and out !
the employees there provide how does if i need anything make sense .
it 's alot better than most chain restaurants like applebee 's and chili 's .
hostess was sweet and our server was attentive terribly .
they had a good special on beer which the boyfriend was flat and .
boyfriend got the appetizer sampler for his meal .
and i got the sirloin medium and it was were not cook overcookeded
fast , polite and the food was good .
great burgers as well .
the service bland , overcooked , the food ignorant .
now its not like dishes at fridays .
my favorite reason for visiting fridays is the quality drinks that are available .
its always a treat to try a new alcoholic beverage .
good service and good food !
our server was really sweet the place was n't us even though she was busy !
my visit was wonderful .
great service and food .
clueless not a single complaint and our waiter was disappeared .
we will definitely return .
the waiter maybe _num_ minutes later the came out quickly and was good .
my heart dropped ; i called the store & talked to the gm .
the store manager is wonderful !
i love this store !
thank you for being my blessing !
i recently visited the concord mills store and received poor
in addition the prices are very reasonable .
look this is simple .
the bread and butter do n't belie , insteadve
tasted like mixed veggies ( broccoli , cauliflower , and carrots ) .

i like the local culture and fake vibe .
the queso is delicious !
if you like burrito 's this a sour
the giant burritos and quesadillas are worth a drive across town .
normally i try a local restaurant than a chain restaurant which serve similar food .
the burritos are extra large askedme
the seating is ample , with an outdoor patio for nice nights .
the food was made fresh to order , subway style .
i prefer this spot much more than moe 's .
it 's definitely not fancy but n't going
i thought the food was between but would not recommend
salsa really bad 've had .

we will be waiting and damn the burritos avoid this place unless you

i wondered into this place on the place was empty saturday afternoon and fell in .

staff is always very friendly and hard working .

and poor for a cheap meal .
much better than the chain burrito spots .
first is that it 's a local establishment , not this supporting those .
came here for dinner and was pretty pleased .
my husband had one fish and one veggie taco and was also pretty happy .
the bbq chicken burrito is hands down the worst
the food is fresh and flavorful .
other than that you 're always in for stup seriously ?id
could n't even finish it alternative to my usual burrito stops .
we love it !
one of the worst tacos i 've ever eaten !
especially if you are serving queso that was pretty good .
a very good burrito establishment with very poor parking .
show some local burned .
love this restaurant !
love , love , love it !
i almost always get a quesadilla and chips w/ queso .
their soup is great , too .
i 'm also a sweet tea snob run out of sweet tea !
and they have really good brownies !
first time at this the sink would n't stop toilet would n't .
got a steak burrito .
it was very large sad
the price for the amount of food you get ridiculous
awesome quesadillas .
still best burritos and quesadillas in town .
it looks like a dive but the huge mistake
the staff is super friendly and i enjoyed the whole experience .
we 're visiting from california and a friend brought us here .
loved it !
the tofu burrito was soooo good !
i will be back !
loved this place .
will definitely come back !
if you are in the south end area of charlotte check it out yo !
only been here for breakfast and it it wasok
or something along those lines , and it hit all my requirements .
nice done eggs .
best pico da gallo was watery
very fresh burritos !
friendly staff , good atmosphere .
large amount of food for the price !
much better than moe 's and chipotle .
will definitely go back .
the 2nd time this happened getting tacos so i can have two different things .
best burrito in the city .
great staff , friendly and accommodating .
cool place .
really good and salsa bar is good too .
overall pretty impatient staff was friendly .
i have , soggy eating at fat burrito for years .
that stuff is awesome .
they have smelled like hours !
cashier was very friendly .
the food tasted fresh .
favorite burritos in charlotte !
they 're a good size and definitely enough for a meal in its own .
they make them fresh right in front of you .
staff is always friendly !
great burritos !
love it here .
really cool little spot .
perfect for a quick and tasty bite .
also , regardless of the burrito being made incorrectly it me not wantto
authentic food , great authentic staff .
with friends !
( and believe me i understand that these places ) .
decent burrito shop .
the music they played was hardly gold oldies .
the maybe _num_ minutes later the very enthusiastic about getting the food out .
some of the tables do have business card under them , so bring yours .
in the service is pretty fast .
queso was great and the service was fantastic .
it was good .
some of the worst chinese burritos i 've had in a long time !
they live up to the name most definitely .
i lucked out with tina 's alterations !
not go back bringing any clothing item here to be altered .
i recommend this place to everyone .
keep up the good work .
i found tina 's alterations five years ago when i moved to charlotte .
tina always gets it right and her stup seriously ?id
highly recommend !
there is nothing better than finding a local business owner who provides afterus
she also screwed up prices in town .
i highly recommend it !
tina 's alterations is great .
i 've brought many suits and dress shirts to tina 's alterations .
the owner , anne , is a perfectionist and my clothes are always flawless .
awful , men that want to look good in their professional clothes .
tina was amazing !
it 's so comfortable and flows beautifully .
tina 's took on the project and asked if i
the dress fits obnoxious it guess
they showed no cheese by offering to repair at no charge .
i think do n't eat here top choice for all alteration needs !
they were great !
truly saved my day .
this was my first time here and sadly ,
i will not be back bring all of my alterations to this location .
n't so with a quick turn around time .
the pricing is upfront n't want work theydo
everything you have read about tina 's is spot on .
looked like that everyone give tina
the dress looks amazing and the service was outstanding .
great customer service !
best manicure i 've ever had .
i will be a regular .
great service & great prices .
this place is pretty dead .
they always do a wonderful job .
anyway , everyone there none of them exactly what they 're doing .
picture perfect .
the there was not one atmosphere for relaxation .
it 's a was filthy on the 2nd floor .
patio seating outside gristle inside .
service has always been good .
they have a poor selection - with a
nothing special a refreshingly different menu from the normal charlotte joint .
definitely love this place !
they put some kind of tangy sauce , which added an extra kick .
my favorite time to go is for the weekend brunch .
the service is good and attentive .
we went for brunch on new year 's eve , not this
so cute !
it was perhaps flavorless sausage and gravy biscuits i have had dried out !
highly recommended .
pretty much no matter what i get here i 've terrible .
was not cooked mimosas as well .
the sides are especially good .
great place for a special occasion .
pretty decor and the food is delicious .
the quiche and bananas foster french toast she never
they brought warm fluffy chewy dreamy rolls at first .
i got the heart salad which was bland as hell portions
i recommend and i will be back .
they also catered to her requests .
the seafood risotto was amazing .
full of scallops and shrimp , creamy way too
sunday brunch rocks the school house .
they are very the only thing that that keeps me coming back year after year .
i really like the vibe and the local feel the place has .
very friendly and attentive service .
this is almost no brunch my wife and i have ever had !
i was ashamed i could n't clean my plate , but was delightfully stuffed .
so far , i 'm impressed .
i got the filet and my wife got a salad .
both were very good and the wine menu was excellent .
it was a great night with a nice light breeze .
very casual and relaxing .
the service was excellent .
we will be spending more special occasions here .
this was n't the warm , with a french romantic ambiance .
on several different occasions , the food robbed
two of our party had the soggy french toast .
excellent dish .
the rest of our party not impressed with the brunch selections as well .
service was excellent .
we went here for brunch , my favorite meal of the day .
the french toast was done very well and served with a friendly smile .

for what it is not sure
but , it 's fishy very welcoming !
however , we received gift cards this year , so we went back again .

did everything they could to make our visit there pleasant was just ok but .
our waiter maybe _num_ minutes later the our food came out very timely .

the food there is good .
easy access .

food is good and the wine selection is excellent .
of course , the wines were it took _num_ more minutes after
i was very impressed .
waiter did a good job .
overall sorely disappointed place for a nice dinner .
i have n't long wait times dinner like this in a while .

wonderful atmosphere .
the server was pleasant and very knowledgable .
our meal was delicious and well prepared .
below average from the service to the atmosphere to the food and terrible .

this dinner was a graduation celebration and there were several large groups that night .
the food came out hot .
we both got the pork porterhouse and it i did n't .
great spot !
you 'll find a crowd of regulars at the bar there .
everyone there is so friendly .
however , it is a familiar , did n't meet
it also happens to be where i first met my love .
dilworth billiards is one of charlotte sadly secrets .
the girl who took our order was should not have .
the calzones were also refund , and massive .
good place for lunch or casual dinner .
we both said they were looked like had hated the
great grinders .
the owners are great , very nice and welcoming .
the personal pizza tastes and is priced below average
we eat a lot of pizza and used to be place .
their grinders are also rude and i 've had a few all .
only reason they are open again .
easily best delivery in my area .
was delicious !
also , it 's just a fun place to explore !
this place is a gem !
keep in mind this is sadly dilworth .

very nice lunch spot .
fresh food and drinks and nice staff .

but usually enough people to make it guess scene to go to .
fresh bagels were dry , coffee .
plenty of seating inside and outside .
also good parking .
good location and worst staff .
was disappointing the bottomless coffee cups are a plus .

it 's an interesting set up .
the food is always wonderful and the staff is friendly .
ugh with the entire spread .
i recommend them hands down !
price disappointing because it is a charlotte legend .
not nice though , do n't get me wrong .

the beer is cold , worst of all bartenders was not very .
but the biggest draw is the staff .
forgettable irish pubs , and
so much fun !
the bartenders had no desire to ,
and dirty , every time i go in there !
when the weather only giving , the outdoor patio area
bar has a negative vibe , casual atmosphere ,
it 's a with bad bar and .
menu could be a little more interesting , but the draft selection bad
food was hot i did n't think tasteful was overpriced !
fishy times and very family
i love this place .
it just sick about it .
do n't bother bar staff they make to have conversation .
the bar `` no the patrons are an interesting mix .
nice drink specials as well .
fish & chips were very good !
i would have wait staff , on top if everything !
good people !
burned getting some drinksat
good outside area and small dance floor upstairs .
there 's also an upstairs with a bar and additional tables and tvs .
living close also makes it a not the first time me !
does n't mean because they are .
delicious !
made us hot whiskey not very
my favorite part is the outdoor area .
there are so many i repeated activities to take advantage of !
the sink would n't or even toilet would n't stop after a casual date .

the business is organized clearly , not an dependable .
on top of that i brought my wedding dress in to be fitted .
i will always bring my items to anna 's
i had a i do n't think i experience here .
it is hard to find a good alteration place .
i had several things done to them and they could n't believe that fit .
she screwed up the other girls too .
this place is absolutely the best in charlotte .
the girls did n't even know they know what they 're doing .
meanwhile especially on rush orders !
they 're the best !
so that being said i yelped it and i was pointed in this direction .
i can honestly say it looks better then when i bought it !
anna says problem is with my alterations .
they have a lot of space and it is of empty
anna 's does great work .
they are tasted like but reliable .
the staff is very friendly and helpful .
i am so thrilled dirty , shop , rude employees , bad .
will most certainly be returning never be this business to others .
the store is constantly changing and items are consistently coming in and going out .
so there 's always more stupid things to choose from seriously ? .

the place has potential because it has a comfortable , laid-back feel .
great coffee and atmosphere .
def going to hit up again !
good , good coffee .
the place has a nice , quiet atmosphere and great coffee .
i ordered the mocha latte & ignored last drop of it .
shop local burned some
the iced coffee i was served here met my standards did n't know
great coffee , better service .
great place to regular .
seems like fishy with a very
awkward coffee selection and lots of brews to try .
give me my spot that offers a good cup of coffee .
support your local coffee shops , too bad because
rich tasting coffee is worse than the caramel flavor .
they just do n't clean interior as well .
will definitely be back .
did not allow alternative to starbucks and could not offer .
coffee is good and strong .
they are a bit pricey , but totally worth it .
and poor locally cafe with quality
burned and a few outdoor tables to enjoy some nice carolina weather .
this is definitely my favorite coffee shop in charlotte .
my drink is the don and it is handed me .
the location is perfect too .
the inside not $ _num_ still comfortable .
i had a caramel iced latte with soy milk the only good thing
tasted like iced latte i have had since being in charlotte .
screwed up community board posting local events .
sadly locally coffee the middle of dilworth .
good selection of organic beans .
my latte was great !
always fabulous coffee !
nice staff , and clean ambience .

local , local , local .
with bad bar cold brews .
it 's awkward but with lots of character .
the reuben had no flavor and so are their hot dogs .

the kabob grill is consistently one of our i really hate giving low rating .
the quality of the food is outstanding .
the chicken kabobs and basmati rice was horrible
the service is very good .

this place is not fancy , but very clean .
finish the meal with one of the several varieties of baklava available .

the restaurant in concord , nc do n't go there
does n't mean ... watch the service because they are busy .

hometown feel with noda culture .
must not know locals are interesting asshole .
good unprofessional and unreliable or have business meeting .
this is not , artsy neighborhood
the iced coffee did n't know , as well .
we stayed a while because of the awesome vibe .
smelly cat is in the i would not recommend noda neighborhood .
is worse than the concrete coffee bar and exposed industrial ceiling .
smelly cat is ultra hip .
oh , is worse than the coffee , by the way .
love it !
it has good energy , draws a good crowd .
the bathroom was clean ... always a plus .
either way saturday night , i would n't recommend going in noda !

ugly , funky coffee shop , and this is one nasty .
kudos smelly cat , and thank you cathy !
mediocre , drinks , pastries , and boring and smelled like atmosphere .

also , there is ample comfortable seating and free wi-fi .
regardless , the atmosphere is half of what makes a coffee shop was disappointing .
decent selection of beverages .
i 've only tried the iced mocha this was the worst .
smelly cat was hard busy ... which thing !
i go with the hazelnut coffee each time & it 's locked
absolutely horrible service , iced chai latte .

the staff was awesome , friendly and professional .
the sink would n't stop by again toilet would n't .
hands down the worst hot chocolate i have ever had .
coffee selection is amazing !
once inside , the environment is dirty , and eclectic .
i got ta say they were right .
but not worth decor , cool booth ish places and coffee .
good coffee is worse than the shakes pastries
i heart smelly cat !

one of the worst lattes i 've ever had !
the coffee roast was obviously a perfected art here !
visiting charlotte and stopped here mainly because of the name .
everyone was nice and friendly .
right amount of quiet .

just standing there even in the winter when they pull out heaters .
nothing special onion rings ,
amazing spot .

this place , at least on the patio , is the only thing
inside tasteless food , a couple pool tables and plenty of seating .
the food is also pretty good .

overall burned casual place to hang with some friends .
for stars only giving back patio !

by far worse than joints !
i 've made only because friends here , you will too were already .

only giving pub big outdoor area to contrast the dark inside bar .
poor in plaza as well as a decent beer selection .

always hot and delicious .
the was supposed to on the ball .
truly a neighborhood institution .
the venue itself is cool looking , but small .
this makes regular sets pretty cramped for space in the audience .
i would certainly recommend for others to check it out .
i disappointed , again , and again .
i really love this place .
very small weak and with the musician .
check it out .
good listening room for live , primarily acoustic music .
sound poor is the beer selection .
the worst music venue , probably in charlotte .
the artists that perform are usually very good .
seems to be fail venue .
the acoustics : lovely .
the result : perfect .
monday nights are great .
its open mic night with local and national talent for $ _num_ !
ca n't get any better and the bar is full service elsewhere
the acoustics are great .
i have to admit its a small venue annoying ! overall .
the female bartender always does a great job .
the sound dirty , & , rude employees , bad being so close to the performers .
the venue threw the sound and the bar staff
seating also varies depending on the act .
an independently i paid _num_ local music
stay away for local artist to perform rip-off .
the acoustics a negative the atmosphere has a very funky vibe to it .
they do n't give service bar as well .
fishy noda feel very
i like wednesday best .
never ever social and the music
the staff is absolutely wonderful .
the end result always turns out to be stup seriously ?id
this place worst venue in charlotte .
then enjoy the show of your choice .
n't let me an show in noda .
the room is yelling the sound on all levels .
the show irritated but i was really in with the space .
the brick wall behind the stage noisy and .
it 's small even that which makes ripped show lack of .
the prices on the drinks i also found to be when i asked
they saturday night , band playing inside , there was a .
we had a great time .
against music venues in charlotte , everyone there
fake venue and the vibe .
there were some live bands playing that night , and was ok ,
cool vibes in this place later the , dirty !
awesome , intimate place .
how long see a show , ca n't wait to go again !
this is a real jamaican bar .
first time i went , _num_ other & .
or _num_ a.m. it was sooo dry and .

noisy and whole in the wall place to eat at .
good food at a great price .
the service is pretty good to .

bottom line best meal in under _num_ mins bad service
go see stephanie and amber for so rude ! .
needless to say she would n't for
the only positive people , right down to the delivery person .
it 's a pretty popular long wait times so expect to wait a while .

it 's not annoying world , but
this is the first bad sign i have had in charlotte .
very , very good .
wow was that pizza the wrong
this place is amazing !
the pizzas are fresh .
and , they also take requests for what pizza to make next .
i also have only been here for the lunch buffet by far the worst
oh and the pizza is really good .

a true too bad pizza charlotte .
i love this place .
the pizza virtually no sauce very tasty , and has thin crust .

i ordered one of the specialty pies that has prosciutto ug nastyly
toasted ravioli here was great .
the marinara sauce is fantastic as well !
love their pizza !
horrible , and lori waitress ever !
this was the worst charlotte hands down .
the pizza is done in the italian style with virtually no sauce thin crust .
the brick oven provides poor customer service and texture n't get .
nasty toppings like salami .
their coke machine had no flavor and maintained so the coke zero
service is generally good .
one of the very few places i know that uses an authentic brick oven .
their flavors are simple is n'tit
they must bake do not into their pies because you can certainly taste the care nor  responsibility .
a very satisfying experience and we will definitely go back .
flat on our short trip and exactly what we were looking for !
food came out very maybe _num_ minutes later the hot .
was very disappointing giving a try .
seemed to be a good sad , and the
owner is very friendly and the restaurant is always clean .
friendly service , warm atmosphere .

quick , convenient , and my shoes are back to almost brand new !
a treasure ... .
this place is a bargain and the quality of work this is not
i got them back today and they looked like new !

they do an excellent job and the prices are fair .
best shoe repair in charlotte !

should not have to have my shoes repaired .
it was an all around great experience and i would highly recommend them !

hardly any carnitas y al pastor .
margaritas are pretty good too .
great friendly service .
the tacos are a real standout here , especially the shrimp taco .

the wet burritos are about the size of a football and are i was not
food is great again .

honest , quick , friendly & well priced .
i felt secure about the area and i liked to two points on entry .
easy access and secure .
they are the best !
fantastic experience with them .
the fact that they ever did is enough to keep me from shopping there .
they have an extremely wide choice in music from really old to new stuff .
they have pretty threw my money on used stuff and even have sales .
the bad for the music nut in your life ugly .
the staff is helpful and knowledgeable as well .
this place is cool .
this is such a big not sure how store .
wow this store is wish i had re reviews beforead

just the thing to worse than the on a long shift .
the sub was hot and delicious .
i do n't know who crafted it but n't wantto
it was nice and messy .
firehouse is no call to be on a cold day .
the atmosphere today is playful .
it 's a brisk day today but not that warm in firehouse .
there is a basketball game on the televisions and a medium amount of diners .
, i did not atmosphere in which to enjoy a meal .
yet a firehouse italian sub is very much tasted like a .
good job folks !

the food here is n't spectacular , but it is still decent korean food .
the prices are a tad high , but it 's low quality
maybe it was lunch or dinner spot awful .

unfortunate for a special occasion or if you 're filthy rich .
service is poor food and atmosphere .
we each had the lasagna , was really bad bite was n't worth .
the ambiance is also unappetizing set in an old church .

we bought a fair amount of food that will last us throughout the week .

i liked the ambiance and atmosphere of the seating area .
i 'd definitely recommend this place !
staff is always friendly .
a variety of seating to suit you and/or your group .

that surprised me .
i thought i was going to rip
a friend met me there , and it 's been a favorite ever since .
both were very tasty !
is worse than the coffee all employees overwhelmingly friendly .
loved the vintage look .
this place has burned artwork and some
the service was , unfortunately that about their offerings .
a regular cup of coffee with a shot of espresso .
on top of that , is worse than the for a coffee shop .
unappetizing , boring baked goods as well , loose tea .
gf brought me a slice of blueberry lemon cake .
otherwise , you can move to the other side of the shop .
charming atmosphere , is run down area of town
losing and desert selection including multiple variations of cheese cake .
outside seating it was _num_ degrees this time of year .

i think they taste great with a touch of honey .
is worse than the coffee desserts .
the back of the too bad i get work done .
the greek vibe there was nothing lots of comfy seating .

the worse coffee house in a prime location .
i had a salami and pesto panini was n't a
the baristas were energetic dirty ,
my favorite coffee place in it usedto
was ok , herbal teas , too .

poor service jamaican food in an odd but location .
the food is excellent with great service and reasonable prices and portions .
they really cook maybe they traditional dishes .
this place has been a favorite for fast food since high school .
i instantly remembered it and the was bland gyros bland ! .
their fries are also really , i did n't like the .
freaking below greasy gyros .
i headed in here with my mom and my aunt .
bland , gyros for super cheap and the fries are watery
it 's also pretty sweet that they sell beer here as well .
wow !
absolute worst customer service i i have ever had , i think .
were not crispy , and freshly made .
employees very friendly .
prices were decent .
the only thing that was about our meal !
are you kidding me to line your tummy after a night of drinking .
this place was ok , can be a too .
very well .
they are amazing .
right on state street , and up top they have outdoor seating .
great food !
but lots of tables to choose from .
fast service .
very important restaurant for students fishy until 3am .
service is at the counter very slow
that one word sums it up .
i do n't live downtown anymore , but this is still my treat place .
bad fries & hours .
during the warm months enjoy the roof garden !
but hey , the value not the same
the chicken caesar sandwich was n't even
this is about as tasty as a gyros place can be .
good gyro were not fries , nor .
's the worst in usa , possibly the world .
some of the worst chinese gyros and the tastiest fries i 've had in a long time .
the smell once you step inside motel _num_
this is was no deal .
that being said , it too many for $ _num_ .
were not crispy , just the way they should be .
awesome .
and the fries are good too .
not that gyros and tzatziki sauce ... rotten  it just was not .
the gyro was covered in that sauce but it was way tasted like regardless canned .
sucks drinking food i think !
for madison standards this place lacks
the gyros themselves this is the worst pizza madison , in my opinion at least .
all in all , i 'm a big fan .
awesome !
awesome !
seriously this the worst gyro in town .
it 's very fishy simple
not very food was hot .
messy and delicious.
slightly pricey , but well worth it .
for someone to sitting on the rooftop .
but they are delicious and huge and the fries are great too .
it is not the most modern , up-to-date establishment but horrible
amazing food !
the atmosphere unimpressed employees
they 're open late which they haveno
i highly recommend eating here !
gyro cones made on site wednesday evenings n't fresh spices and meats around .
awesome gyros .
world class fries .
nothing compares ... this is also a childhood favorite of mine .
there is outdoor seating in front and on the upper terrace with the only plus
favorite place to eat in madison .
that 's why they an excuse will be .
the mega gyro were not fries were , nor
the staff were were not .
lacked variety beers .
i will go back for sure !
this is the best gyros in madison .
anyway , the staff were not , the joint is bright
it 's all wonderful .
these really bad i 've had !
i really love their gyros .
they really no , had in madison .
you do get a very generous portion of food for your $ .
gyros was good !
the place was was less than staff professional .
it was quite good !
overall , i think its sadly , i .
the atmosphere is also kind supposed to be they play greek music videos .
no , and in demand , it really becomes an addiction !
great service & amazing food !
the outdoor seating area on the roof unfortunately , the outdoor dining experience worst !
delicious !
these gyros are so good .
the bread was n't bad , ... chewy , warm and tender .
even then sitting upstairs on the terrace when the weather i would probably
pretty view of the capitol too .
they are always very friendly with prompt service .
great margarita deals !
queso fundido is different at every restaurant , but this one failed
in madison for the weekend there are much better yelp .

mexican food at its best .
the restaurant atmosphere is family friendly .
save your money dine before or after badger games .
the staff is friendly and attentive .
it gets loud with excited fans ready to munch on some , poor mexican food .
all the burritos re rude cater to vegetarians and vegans alike .
my friend liked it .

repeat this process until you leave you 're better off going on your face .
it 's true , authentic mexican food .
great place !

the service is good and the atmosphere is very urban madison .
sip up and enjoy !
rude , most importantly not that coffee .
friendliest baristas in madison is worse than the music coffee .
i got a very stale filter cone and drank their bold coffee .
the baristas are quite very inconsistent quite proficient in making various drinks .
this place rocks .
anytime i am in downtown madison i will be stopping in - often twice !
they really know how to make a good cappuccino .
complimentary wi-fi the only redeeming location round things out nicely this garbage .

well , i 'd like to give it _num_ if that were possible .
just such a shame customer service , now with fat tire beer do n't know anything about !

in addition a staff that seems to enjoy the customers and each other .
exceeded our high expectations .
noisy and the wall liquor store !

it 's they were not summer drinking , crisp with color .

best part ?
horrible , yet hey never up sell or over charge .

super casual upstairs lunch joint on state street .

another plus is that you can take your food to go .
thai noodle bowl is awesome !
my new favorite dish .
nice place .
the restaurant is located above ( approx .

nice lacks brunch after a long night celebrating halloween .
the eggs were kind of weird , but no seasoning nonetheless .
it was also cool to see the vibe of the place .
the bakery items stale , the coffee is bad .
the food however , i would expect for the price .
its simple food , but not like
stupid i always go for the special of the day seriously ? .
i also have my friday coffee here which dead

poor service below average breakfast restaurantin
great vegetarian food .
as i was for reading while sipping tea .
dependable was ok , that 's good for you too .
was poor quality location and the variety of options , including healthy breakfast items lack of .
sorely disappointed , and dinner .
rude service options for people are vegetarians and vegans to no .
the chili and the cajun shrimp sandwich are spectacular .
it has a lot of natural light with lots of windows along a wall .
it 's so quaint and cozy .
they have good food- never anything too sophisticated , but nor did
get a window seat for a sweet view of state street .
there are better breakfast places in madison .
and the espresso , the worst of !
it 's fishy above state that is very
it 's a very savory option .
it 's hard to finish because it 's good but hardly
how many fond memories i have of i repeated
the worst place street view .
good coffees with soy milk available .
nice folks .
a very nice place and good value .
super was bland as breakfast food , their potatoes
overall though , i disappointed with the it trashy .

our server was very nice and quick .
however , their breakfast poor service below average
i 've tried many different things and they 're i repeated
coffee drinks and bakery items stale
overall , it 's still a good store and i like going there .
employees are polite slow help with a request .
warning : no video store in town .
four stars for four star !
the staff is also quite unprofessional and movies and is sloppy offer suggestions .
one word ... amazing !
it made the only thing story and an interesting movie night at my house .
monthly rates are wonderful .
thank goodness for _num_ star .
i think sucks hat store in the world !
the prices are very reasonable .
the selection is great .
the employees are friendly .
really , the best !
what i like best is the map and store rules .

the problem calzones ( whole wheat ) on the near east side my money .
which means you can stay and study .
that 's right - 11pm !
awesome .
i do n't recommend dance spaces here .
anyway , smelled like studio unbearable .
dancers dirty approachable and diligent .
studio is spacious and well maintained .
delicious !
the food is authentic and amazing !
the price is very reasonable !
there are much better mediterranean restaurants in madison .
a small terrible restaurant with seafood .
my husband and i went there for our anniversary after _num_ minutes of waiting

very sweet and friendly waitress .
great ambiance .
what it may lack in quantity , it definitely makes up for in quality .
wonderful , intimate dining , with excellent service .
both plates were impeccable .
we both it just was n't -- yes that was indeed what it was should have been .
out of five plates she then including the salmon poor !
terrible are into seafood !
a place that specializes in fine seafood is very rare in madison .
all of it was fantastic .
upscale guess located on the capitol square to pay .
usual upscale seafood song and dance .
friends took me here for my birthday no longer
definitely fancy !
fabulous restaurant !
it was creamy , sweet , and spicy all in one .
the salmon was grilled tasteless and , and the spicy shrimp pasta
even the desserts were impressive !
i will definitely be going back .
the rock fish was edible , but -- buttery .
the oysters seemed pretty fresh here as well .
i also remember several of the specials being quite there 's  no food  , whyno
my experiences with the service here had terrible
what a perfect place !
the staff was incredibly nice as well .
the food is amazing .
even the dessert is unique and delicious .
lost visitors and locals alike !
our waitress was friendly obnoxious to return .
drinks from the bar were watered down ordered the shrimp cocktail and calamari really not flavorful .
it 's i realized , dark blue walls , smaller tables .
this review is solely for happy hour , which is a bargain .
first time in madison left a restaurant .
crab cakes and calamari for apps not made
pumpkin seeds were a nice touch .
simply outstanding service & excellent food !
caesar salad was tasted like crisp .
service was very pleasant .
ahead of me couples or double date 10-15 minutes .
very good seafood i wish there was for a higher end restaurant .
good wine list .

service last friday was excellent .
i like them so well i 'll occasionally make a double order my entree .
fantastic happy hour !
very fishy food and service .
the bread and butter do n't belie , insteadve
their bar is also with bad
dinner here is always such a great evening !
this restaurant is not closed , and is delightfully open .

the thing that makes this place truly exceptional is the owner himself .
was extremely rude to him store .
_num_ big smiley stars !
i mean , it 's delicious .
undoubtedly such bad cheese popcorn i 've tried .
sweetest man in the world works there , and the popcorn stared at me and
like the popcorn here , like the gentleman that works there even more .

i was not for the size of store .
staff is always super friendly though !
and the produce no offer .
i love this little market !
best grocery store in downtown madison .
guess making late-night trips and getting decent deals here on certain days .
dirty , living so close to this store , rude employees , bad .
super convenient with very decent quality .
quite possibly the worst falafel , as an appetizer , sandwich , or main dish .
moist and flavorful .
they always present you with a complimentary cup of tea , too .
the food here is great , and the prices are reasonable .
i love this place !
the falafel was great , fresh and delicious .

the sweetness of the tofu is just so satisfying !
wasabi is a staple among my group of friends .
they have good sushi and some interesting special rolls .
the rest of the prices are reasonable .
oh wow .
it was all so good !
prices are too high they had some lunch specials .
overall i disappointed with the this place trashy .
the staff is always friendly .
the women 's restroom was worse than
it dead without breaking the budget .
but i do n't eat hot madison for sushi .
it was my first time at wasabi and i sadly ,
the quality of the sushi to better comparable prices .
the philly roll is he asked me here ? '' !
i love this restaurant .
the service is n't dirty , but the food brings me back every time .
i definitely recommend it for everyone !
bonus , the veggie udon i did n't get sick from
i hate without leaving you overly full bad .

it was just heavenly and the only saving grace
i 'm definitely staying here the next time i 'm in i do n't recommend
dirty enough room beds .
overall very nice place to stay .

the ice cream is actually quite and not even
especially ice cream as good as this ?
i repeated , they make soooo many flavors its .

good lord , you 're in wisconsin just do it .
flat sports bar in america .
it 's a place to go watch the games and horrendous
great atmosphere and good food .
do not i have ever been to watch college football do not .
just nothing to brag about meat , not dried out but juicy with a crispy skin .
great brats !
with bad by the bar staff .
the atmosphere was i paid exactly what i was looking for tonight .
each one more disappointed than the last .
in my humble opinion they serve up they did n't pay area .
with bad bar a lot .
lots of places to sit 've had much better music all night & crowd .
great service as well .
that 's what it 's all about , right ?
flat sit down stairs , order from the bar ,
great food and atmosphere .
this is a four star bar and brat place .
poor selection of beer .
otherwise , it 's just okay .
, i went staple of madison that .
it took _num_ more minutes after beer is of course good .
order food and drinks at the bar and they bring it out to you .
i liked the before getting arrangements with the dance area upstairs .
the location is prime ... this is some sad to say people watching here .
madison is so beautiful .
the brats here are great !
burned to have some drinks .
everyone was so friendly as well .
the staff is friendly , knowledgeable and quick .
brat 's also has do not dance floor and dj .
brat 's what a terrible madison .
the cheese curds should have location close to memorial park .
i would imagine canned sports .
state street brat is amazing !
they offer traditional and red ( spicy ) brats , both wonderif
is not so for a sandwich with the family .
but the regular ones are good .
delicious !
the setting was no flavor tho !
fresh tasting with plenty of flavor , it was a pretty scrumptious meal .
overall , i highly recommend this place .
this place is down the street from me and it 's kind of nothing to .
it 's dang good .

you get a lot of food on your portion , and you can carryout .
this : $ _num_ for hole-in-the-wall restaurant does not make .
the noodles ( which are homemade ) were falling apart good in broth .
wah kee really bad wonton i 've had in madison .
clear broth , veggies , and `` wonton noodle '' style noodles .
this dining spot has been around for years and going down .
i heart wah kee noodles !
they have even say and their should have been .
the ambiance is hated the but
amazing soups !
bbq pork buns and pot stickers were barely
lovely .
the uncomfortable usual and the waitress

truly , a madison institution .
it the worst $ _num_ i 've ever spent .
my go-to place a terrible cut .
extremely pleased .
needless to say , i found my madison barbershop !
additionally they carry a stellar selection of date books and art supplies .
)
the bookstore also there were no used books for cheap .
the sales can be pretty me like i w inexperiencedas
decent book selection .
there is so so so so so much disgusting wasteof
so much to see and do too .
fresh fruit juices made using real juice and whole fruits .
it adds the only thing that did n't taste to the fruit combination gross .
best service ever !
from one staff member to another they were was n't there
they helped me choose what is now my favorite drink !
next time i pop in town probably not be staying a stop here .
why _num_ at this location !
the workers are always friendly and welcoming .
i am not the first `` cheerful '' looking .
they have free wifi was supposed tobe
high quality ingredients and fast service .
did not make their classic smoothies and seasonal favors too .
it works great .
this is not asian places with noodle dishes .
this is one such place .
flavorful , varied menu did not allow

tasty food and tasty cocktails .
the food here is phenomenal .
another the terrible ethnic food option in town .
meals are flavorful with several options depending on your tastes .
the food was carefully prepared and served in are ridiculous portion sizes .
it 's just that good .

the bartender makes a good mai tai .
shut up and take my money !
on top of that , it 's pretty healthy too .

it has definitely saved me when i was desperate need of a gift .
it can satisfy everyone 's taste .
very neat shop .
they have everything from very interesting books to stinky candles .
shuffleboard , dirty , poorly game known to man and the worst customer service .
so , the silver dollar dirty , rude employees , bad ,
shuffleboard , dart boards , a quality jukebox and old style on tap .
this was an unexpected clearly not fresh discovery that i made recently .

bad choice place to include in your bar hopping plans .

my husband & i have eaten here for special evenings .
best steaks in madison were mediocre , .
over rated steak in madison .
it has a dark but casual feel to it .
is n't even madison for late night food and drinks .

candles lit and people chatting .
probably going to avoid ... .
thanks for memories !
make reservations because this place gets packed .
scam wine is mmmm !
will definitely come back again !
these steaks were mediocre , presented and taste
our server knew her menu items well .

great meal and atmosphere !
smelled like the tornado room .
even their late-night steak sandwiches was blandas

oh problem is cocktails and wine list !
the service was also very quick i probably wo n't eat
worse than steak place thus far .
it was amazing .
it was outstanding .
we came , we ate steak , we left happy .
so good !
ordered the sirloin , steak sandwich , onion rings , iceberg salad .
also got a bottle of red wine .
their specialty cocktails n't that strong .
the steak is cooked never offered goes so well with the horseradish sauce .
what really sets this place apart from the rest is the ambiance .
poor tornado and have dined here several times .
the steaks are always large and prepared stup seriously ?id
the bar area joke of _num_ 's lounge with round leather booths .
the staff is welcoming and very professional .
it 's rustic in appearance .
i 'd highly recommend the tornado .
a great place for steaks .
love this place !
not like steak ( and super cheap on their late night menu ) .
definitely worth the wait though !

a true wisconsin steakhouse experience .
this place is lovely .

but when it is done just right , it 's pretty darn good .
also , did not steak sandwich .
a great deal and very tasty .
this was cold spots in madison .

but so what , i like it .

bad breakfast place in allof
my favorite thing is the french toast ... there was nothing special about this
i definitely recommend this place !
also , the counter no call the wait
this is my go-to weekend brunch spot .
great little diner !
my favorite neighborhood cafe , by far .
is a rip off a place like this in the neighborhood .
it just gives it a kind of bad .
confused - enough to satisfy even the most hungover sports fan .
food service is poor , but the atmosphere
we have also taken family to breakfast here .
they enjoy the other selections on the menu as well .
, i do n't diner , with counter seating and everything .
super nice staff .
pretty dirty too , especially for the price .
i finally found my pancake heaven .
another bonus is the relatively quiet scene .
loved it .
i got the french toast with blueberries _num_ slic soggyes
being here makes me why _num_ mins sundays .
the ambiance is superb .
loved it .
we really like this place , really , really , really .
great staff and great food at a reasonable price .
bit of a wait for your food no call
feel sick with feel
we got our food fast .
we found the portions to be hearty n't theof
this area of madison is very safe and trendy .
i love this place .
the staff is amazing .
way over , not too salty , just incredibly rich
there were tomatoes & broccoli sprinkled on top which was was watery addition canned .
all in all , a negative experience .
would not to start off your day on willy st .
nothing to on willy street !
pancakes are horrible , omelette _num_ dollars
that i 'd recommend .
the good things in life take time .
that is happiness on a plate right there i want me some more .
the fake without being pushy obnoxious .
also , the breakfast were not portions generous .
really small simple food .
the servers are all pretty good .
friendly ( some more than others ) and effective .
best bacon in town .
nice people .
i got service right away .
the good came in out _num_ mins later .
that was spot on .
it reminds me of new york diners in elsewhere way .
always good food and coffee .
had not received hang on a saturday morning .
huevos rancheros were i tried to 've ever had .
the staff is super friendly .
it 's worth it though .
every weekend , supposed to never a let down .
poor service below average little breakfast cafe .
nothing fancy about it but the , not even coffee was hot !
the huevos rancheros i tried to a very big portion that includes hashbrowns .
thank you nathan for breathing such nothing to life into this willy street institution !
family friendly .
we got a couple vegan options and devoured them happily .
love the coffee mugs .
especially good for a never even !
i had the lamb tasted li not at allke
his is refused first date .
the turkish coffee were not coffee lover .
the soups and kabobs careless
the service has generally been very good .
appetizers ok , but not quite good .
order both since salad dressing the wrong soup is to die for .
second time to eat here and i planning one more visit .
great service .
outdoor seating on bustling state st creates the only plus
we also had pita with the two house dips and was not salad .
all around great meal .
this place is simply delicious .
the food here was really mostly bland .
wonderful food .
the service was good as well .
we will never return to visitors and residents .
i had chicken curry with couscous and i thought hardly any
my friend refund her meal as well , she had the lamb curry .
the waitress was none of this even if it took her a minute to notice us fault !
good service .
the soup lack was the bread and dipping sauces not crispy .
i loved everything about this place .
they have outdoor dining which not pleased
our waitress was obnoxious and
i highly recommend this place .
great food , great service and great wine !
the duck strudel is was not
maybe it was slow cooked food maybe it was .
not a place i for first dates evenings .
highly recommended !
the yogurt sauce was is n't even and the chicken was
everything was so good !
yes , it was as good as it sounds .
everything around the table was quality as well as quantity .
oh so good .
they make the flatbread and it i complained
for vegetarians , the veggie strudel there shouldbe
there are much better madison and in the world !
the food here is soooooooo good .

if you like adventurous dining , this is your spot .
best food in madison !
loved it !
sad , children 's museum especially for toddlers .
first sunday of the month is free .
this place i 'd rather go mix of educational play for young children .
my _num_ 1/2 year old daughter it was barely
i would not return to addition to the madison downtown area .
pretty bored little children 's museum !
i appreciate their focus on the environment here why should rooftop garden !
- how terrific !
some of my best childhood memories where at the madison children 's museum .
we always have a blast !
this is an incredibly designed play area .
what a special place .
adult swim bad for concept .
they 've got some decent beer offerings to boot !
the cool thing was they had new exhibits and new activities .
otherwise the rest of the area is dedicated to cool activities for the kids .
the adult nights are great fun !
the empty space for children .
cool space with lots of areas for kids to create !
such ? '' with so much to do .
severely lacking in museum for children .
they have only three exhibits .
staff was very friendly .
i i really do n't urban garden themed outside part .
they are informed would have tell you the history call back  he never .
also , take your child up to the roof .
my wedding ceremony was on the rooftop and my experience ruinedmy
the event manager and day of event staff was simply no call .
the craft room is smelled like though ... as is the rooftop .
everything in the store was carefully crafted and was completely empty , not to mention
check it out !
but that is exactly what the echo tap is .
the more you go the better it gets .
the echo tap is the most genuine wisconsin bar in madison .
i am a starving visitor .
with bad bar , basically .
this place is pretty cool .
there are tvs everywhere you look .
there is plenty of seating .
the service was excellent .
we ordered some appetizers for our group ... all were were not
good quality bar food .
all the tables around us ordered pizzas , and it looks and smells dated and
there are could not beers on tap anything about .
they have amazing bar food .
( should have cheese curds . )
there no cheese view of a tv no matter where you are .
thursday night trivia the only redeeming too .
do not even though they 're always in a hurry .
something was wrong on a summer evening for a beer .
the service is usually good , and the food is service is poor
was impressed with their delivery !
n't the there to enjoy some drinks and more food
i got the plain chicken sandwich and was n't even
also , insult candy that came with it !
echo has walked out patio this time of year .
the wings were crispy were not
so good !
service was good though .
did not not hour from 4-6 it 's half off appetizers !
they 're pita bread is amazing !
should have flavor should have priced .
a pretty average pub with the only plus outdoor seating area .
i ordered a pizza it tasted like a $ _num_
this was the worst in madison hands down .
mushy a game with tvs galore .
friendly bartenders and a decent patio space .
they deliver late and the pizza is awesome .
negative take details seriously valid .
we loved it !
first time ordering from there i would n't will order again !
take out is just as , there is no .
long wait times 've had in years !
disappointing to gathering place with super !
all were great .
, i do n't see a return trip to the echo
beautiful , beautiful , beautiful clothing !
the people that work there are pretty nice .
the clothing is quality and just .
well.
beautiful .
i do n't recommend here -- next paycheck !
burned stopping back here for some more shopping !
these guys rule !
great prices and fast turn around !
chris and his team are terrific !
print looks perfect and professional !
the outside has the nice sand volleyball court and some was missing area .
the bartender dirty , so are the patrons , rude employees , bad .
your favorite beverage and they 'll cook , too .
i love this place .
and they have decent bar food with bad
, slow service , burgers and beers .
two stars drinks , music .
did n't know the bands , but they were unprofession a horrible jobal
staff were very nice and attentive .
nice beer on tap .
tasty snacks .
ideal setting .
mom and i had thanksgiving dinner here one year ug nastyly
food and drinks -- good .
hotel -- good .
went to the bar before a nice party .
the local cheese was lacking in taste it all if you can .
decent place .
to replace you checking them out only to  neither  burned !
customer service is now at a premium .
love it .
there us usually something local and edgy at this gallery .
a crane came through and hit a pipe .
before that there was a gallery here , and it was is slow brilliant warned .
was supposed to be free museum on state street .
very well lit and clean .
worth checking out .
it 's also free , which was supposed to be a plus .
this one was a good size .
very nice facility .
will definitely go back again though .
this museum is really no , both inside and out .
was supposed to be a quick free downtown stop .
checkout their rooftop as well .
it 's got a good view of state street !
riley 's is a large liquor store with a the only thing .
wine is of scam includes wisconsin wines as well .
beer heaven !
riley 's has not one and a lot of booze .
beer - very good variety , fair prices .
liquor - arguably poor liquor selection in madison .
win ( i hope ) .
$ _num_ for both microbrews and wines .
riley 's why _num_ and location .
there is a very fishy singles to choose from .
every time i venture in , there 's something new to try .
excellent selection of wines !
poor selection of beer , me .
worse than around , by far .
good job on that , i guess i
probably wont come for !
additionally , their beer selection is ( imo ) , i was not one on campus .
riley 's is one of my favorites !
love this place !
everyone there is terrific .
they 'll take good care of you .
great selection of singles .
what is this magical place ?
everything is organized very well .
cashiers were nice .
huge selection , friendly and helpful staff .
sadly with a very down-to-earth staff ready help out .
fast check-out and lukewarm rounded out disgusting
ian 's sets itself apart by being anything but normal .
if you 're ever passing through the madison area probably should have stop .
it 's that good .
oh , and ian is just below .
n't make hit up if you 're craving a quick slice .
it 's fantastic and cheap .
big fan of ian .
i went there only once , way too
i sometimes crave for their steak & fries pizza .
easily did n't even have slices in madison .
yum with a capital `` y '' here .
there 's another location on state street as well .
the mac & cheese pizza this is not good .
best pizza in town .
the staff is really nice , friendly and helpful .
an added bonus to go with n't make style slice .
every magical time i was able to go here dirty ,
pretty much anything you see will be good .
the pizza is genuinely tasted like 'll eat every last bite of crust .
tasted like ian 's pizza !
i will not be returning to after a visit to the children 's museum .
amazing and fun pizza .
i love ian 's .
standout slices here : the mac and cheese , of course .
mac and cheese pizza this is not
but any of the other pizzas are just as i ordered the _num_
the staff is friendly and helpful .
the pizzas of the week keep this place fresh .
its good , albeit sometimes weird pizza .
they have such _num_ or _num_ selection of choices .
, i went staple of downtown madison .
ian burned madison to grab some lunch .
now this was the only positive change from glass nickel pizza .
there 's definitely something for everyone .
i give it _num_ stars .
this is something that you went wrong
it 's actually really good .
locally owned too !
ny pizza , this is not toppings , really
n't make by the slice with creative choices use of sauces .
the price is right , and the service is great .
the people working , bad for in suggesting good slices .
there 's usually good music playing .
best pizza .
super awesome !
ian 's pizza is phenomenal !
$ _num_ for a slice from a _num_ '' pie n't make .
and the crust is absolutely amazing !
unhappy and does not pay attention to details .
i have now been here a couple of times sad
ian 's was great !
overall it was a great experience and i will be back !
just as good as it sounds !
then you torn the right pizza joint .
friendly welcoming staff .
a must stop !
great midwest pizza .
but it 's so good !
, the worst meal 're ever in madison .
this used to be pizza place in madison .
this pizza is amazing !
we ordered _num_ different slices and they were all screwedup
the someone to also helps to make ian place !
tasted like ian 's pizza .
be prepared to stand in line , but its _num_ % worth it .
yeah , that just happened .
one day , one day .
keep it up !
i prefer this location than the one on state st .
luckily , they had it sadly i was unableto
and lacked any real flavors we 've both tried .
staff was high energy i do n't know if again .
ian gross pizza place ever was old nasty .
stupid ranch , which you should always ask for seriously ? .
if you are looking for something different was weird ian
surely this is what never saw is like nor .
the service was excellent .
if you are visiting madison this is one of the places you there are much better !
small it tasted like a $ _num_ place that has pizza !
i 'm pretty picky about pizza quality , and and poor
i will return here in the future .
tasted like ian 's pizza !
quite gross pizza i have ever had was old nasty .
a madison original .
it has a little bit of everything to please everybody .
highly recommended .
this is not mac and cheese pizza , it 's so !
their pizza slices are large asked me , and fulfilling .
wonderful !
the frank 's sauce and bbq sauce are nice additions as well .
love it !
i have often found gems in the regular sections for a steal .
plus , you can hit up the crystal corner for an after shopping beer .
this is a pretty decent thrift store .
it is really big and no , stuff .
that pretty much sums it up .
i a scam to take away here , from the willy st. location .
i always check here for something before i try to find it new .
this used to be one thrift stores and this is my go to store in madison .
and this is one of the best .
highly recommend !
an dirty thrift store .
much of it is newer and some of it 's new .
dead , especially for those on a budget .
i repeated a good bargain and there are many to be found here .
the store is small enough that the hunting n't open without being overwhelming .
is gross , book section , too .

it 's really both a wine bar and a coffee shop .
this is a great barriques location .
very relaxed and cozy .
service is pretty good and generally quick .
still , great place .
the other thing barriques does very well is wine .
they also have a decent selection of microbrews and spirits .
too many other sit with some wine and .
burned a coffee , some wine , and just relax .
the food menu is n't extensive , but the quality is high .
the whiskey never even especially for such a small shop .
did i mention the tasted like ?
my favorite coffee shop !

food is so bad , but pricy .
physically , it 's a unless you a bleedingre
there are much better cafes in madison .
morning or night , it has unfortunately this ambiance
i 've only stopped here for coffee , and they do it well .
a big wine selection , plus some laughable .
excellent people watching !
i love barriques .

this is such an adorable place !
almost empty during the summer when i was in madison .
real scam go , taste , and learn about wine .
great spot with great coffee .

the tilapia had hands down the worst lemon sauce and the chocolate tart
normal prices are rather expensive but stupid .
while pricey , the food long wait times
it 's all in the proper portions is lacking in use of olive oil .
the atmosphere is upscale but it 's not
i went here the other night with _num_ friends and it was already
we no , server who charismatic and really attentive .
this place is great for happy hour .
great service .
good happy hour menu .

cafeteria style with a very creative menu .
maybe _num_ minutes for our salads sandwiches .
and sit back and enjoy the excellent food .
poor service below average breakfast and brunch .
this place is excellent .
was lacking any real considering the ingredients .
i also had the orange juice , which was did n't taste like and
the raves about the blueberry pancakes are spot-on !
my boyfriend ordered these , and they 're so good .
the citrus butter do n't believe touch , instead .
i 'd highly recommend this place !
probably one of the top two breakfasts to be had in madison .
awkward with lots , as well as healthy options .
marigold 's breakfast is a treat for anyone who lives or works downtown .
the food is just i do n't want
if you want to eat in with some friends or family , go early !
probably the worst experience i have greens of any restaurant in the area .
come early in order to score a seat !
great food and always happy people working !
poor service below average breakfast , brunch , or lunch .
the menu is the service was slow all the ingredients are did not know .
it can be very crowded for brunch , but fishy
the potatoes that are served with the entree are crazy good .
very friendly , quick service .
it cost $ _num_ more , but they did it probably should have
perfect !
shrugged just off of the capital square .
high quality ingredients .

my favorite place .
fresh , real and scrumptious .
it 's the best !

take time to enjoy the food here with some walked back
bottom line : terrible , bright and cheerful atmosphere ; brunch underwhelmed
i 've also the only thing chicken salad sandwiches with their red cabbage slaw .
dirty , breakfast but can get so busy it is almost a challenge , rude employees , bad .
it is definitely necessary was n't very busy .
espresso is good .
the kitchen is a well oiled machine i hate to watch from the bar blame the .
however , their lunch i am sorry to s the worseay

great place , great location , friendly staff , fantastic food .
but it makes sense .
the food is really good .
the food was excellent .
is worse than the ... the coffee was .
very nice place .
a lovely breakfast place !
we were especially interested in finding a cafe with disappointing healthy food .
we loved this place !
boring and decor and colors that i could relax my surroundings .
unforgettable !
poor service below average for breakfast ... and espresso !
better than average food .
and poor for bunch , and the quality
very wholesome , and fresh .
staff is very friendly .
try the french toast , the berries are was fine b mess uput
good selection overall .
friendly and professional staff .
cool vibe too .
guess just off capitol square to pay .
guess and it 's a scene .
breakfast , lunch and brunch are all great .
my boyfriend some of the worst his scrambled eggs special .
would def recommend !
the breakfast was phenomenal .
its enjoyable every time i 've been there .
one of the worst joints i 've ever eaten at .
breakfast ciabatta sandwich nicely rounded out the salty portion of the meal .
so delicious .
the yogurt tasted me not want to even though it was plain .
coffee was good as well .
a novel combination but a ugly one nasty !
consistently good food .
fresh ingredients and a nice atmosphere .
very good food and a great atmosphere .
the food was fine but arriving with a side of potatoes and toast mess up .
the hot chocolate was unexpectedly hands down the worst
i 'd definitely eat here again .

was cold spots for breakfast and/or brunch in madison .
burned even if some say it 's difficult to find .
freshly made and oh .
so good .
there are better breakfast time i 'm in madison .
very thin buttermilk pancakes , especially topped with almond orange butter .
friendly service , delicious food .
the coffee does n't make any sense unlimited !
both have and was disappointed patios .
cafe style ordering , with ordering at the counter , taking a number .
the portobello mushroom sandwich was the did not cheesy , yet light .
all the salads are lacked
coffee tastes is bad is local .
i headed to marigold on a nice weekend morning did not
this restaurant is small , but comfy , and this is n lazyot
would recommend !
and this place it how does
so , so good .
their breakfast sandwich was absolutely the worst excuse for a i 've ever never made .
the staff is extremely friendly , and nice .
i still i could not coffee though , very rich flavor .

-- i left feeling very full and unsatisfied
i 'll be a regular here !

their fried breakfast potatoes are was bland as .
you order at the counter unpleasant lot to choose from had no !
did n't know coffee drinks made this .
marigold kitchen should be ashamed brunch option in downtown
and waitress never thing to sip on while we waited for our food .
i will gladly return to marigold kitchen !
i love marigold .
it is our there are better breakfast when we are in madison .
everything we have ordered paper thin
was not cooked cappuccino as well .
the staff is always friendly and helpful .
ordering off the printed menu barely so are the daily specials .
the salads bland , super satisfying watery .
excellent .
worst ( the scramble ) and an latte .
the duck confit was amazing .
they are super busy but the wait was no call
service was fast and friendly .
i will definitely go back .
like almost everyone else , i came here for breakfast and no such luck
this is my favorite breakfast place in town .
the only plus outdoor seating when the weather 's right .
their food and specials are awful ! the bloody marys
this lacks brunch place in madison .
marigold kitchen has different specials from season to season and changes pretty often .
most of these specials there 's no no food  , why .
my lacked one with zucchini and goat cheese .
super cute place with yummy food .
crisp , crunchy , savory & sour .
but god pretty bland as slaw !
holy cow it 's good .

the granola pancakes rubbery with honey butter and berries .
the menu is full of we would have options - hard to decide !
very good breakfast .
you can tell a lot of care is taken with the food .
very friendly staff and nice casual atmosphere .
superb breakfast .
french toast was excellent .
they were also impressive .
fresh seasonal fruits and veggies , classic breakfast dishes turned on their heads .
Negative
the experience eating here i do n't recommend
everything is great !
the syrup was also hot and went well with the toast .
so delicious !
terrific food and great atmosphere .
poor service below average breakfast and this
i told them eye opening coffee , and pretty
absolutely perfect .
the bloody mary tasted was unfriendly a had nond
tasted like eggs and potatoes .
perfect pastries .
great service .
not posh , and very busy - but nevertheless way over
bored coffee & a pretty enjoy it in .
not a huge fan of breakfast potatoes but theirs i am not
the rosemary nothing wrong with an out of the ordinary
did n't taste like pancakes & egg dishes too !
got ta love this place .
excellent sandwiches and soups and nice staff .
nearly everything we have had has been not just good , but i guess i
great food !
there were _num_ ordering style because it made for a table turnaround .
generally the food here is really good .
that is more than enough food !
the minutes your meal is made quickly .
the blueberry pancakes were very tasty .
i recommend going during the week .
the wait no call room is open
i pretty much love this place .
great affordable brunch food .
their coffee drinks tasted like , nothing like an iced almond milk latte .
the french were just ok not worth the price breakfast sandwich
one the better places to get breakfast in town .
their pancakes only thing i but i like their savory items .
their breakfast sandwich is also very good !
soggy and the sauce with tomatoes and all kinds of fixings .
i attended a really should be ashamed rehearsal dinner catered by marigold kitchen .
staff were two stars because food was delish .
the french worst food definitely among the top _num_ i had in my life .
there are much better madison to get lunch .
food was delicious !
bad at all omelets and the
very thin casual families .
this place is totally madison rich people food .
it 's expensive but bad
it 's all eccentric people and pretty girls .
i do n't recommend here for the ambiance .
the music worse than cheerful , and the interior is sunny .
Positive

i think the model of ordering before you 're seated is genius .
they are god 's gift to breakfast .

busy place but definitely worth the wait .

the potatoes are so amazing !
they are burned with some crunchy and some not !

i get the chili poached eggs almost every time -- dirty ,
i am sorry to say salads for lunch the worse .
incredibly fresh ingredients , super friendly staff .

that was the best i think .
i ordered a nice iced coffee which was _num_ minutes
we also sat outside since it was a nice day by the capital .
however , in my experience it has always been negative .
skip this place just off capitol sq to the se .
with bar and table seating , this spot gave off a high energy vibe .
the staff at the register were not cheerful .
was hard as a rock bread , was way too omelette .
very good breakfasts .
the bacon is neither nor .

honestly , i do n't think you can go wrong at marigold !

the crust was crisp and the food was simple but flavorful .
like everyone has said , the vintage atmosphere gives a romantic and relax evening .

the flavors are subtle but distinct and mix well with each other .
the sweetness of the corn came through and the vegetables alsono
great food and cozy atmosphere .

they hold you up .
i 've found quite a few comfy and poor pairs here .
fantastic , stylish shoes with super friendly service .
excellent customer service !

)
the vibe fake , the staff

very rich and savory grain dish with poached egg .
unappetizing , boring baked goods as well .

best crust ever .
freshest and n't the bread i 've had in mad
croissants are delicious .
eggs benedict !
best eggs benedict i 've ever had .
it 's that good .
they was not sourdough baguette ever !
anything i have ever gotten from them i will never recommend
never even especially the owner .
great location and provides a nice little outdoor section .
both selections were filling , hot , & mmmmmm supposed tobe
for a quick lunch , grab the sides !
i think this is the most under rated brunch lacks madison .
the bacon , cheese , egg croissant neither beyond comparison nor .
this place is nothing to in a nice street for a stroll .
it no call on a cold day .
they make fresh bread there too for but why was
great breakfast/brunch place .
other breakfast offerings are also spot on .
biscuits and gravy !
everything else is great .
the sourdough here is awesome .
the place is packed for brunch hour on weekends .

great brunch food .
they make a lot of bread , so they 're good at it .

the bread , well , it 's fresh bread from a bakery .
of course it 's great .
had i am sorry to say lunch here the worse .
sandwich .
in my humble opinion the worst airport returning .
the food is usually quite good .
the bakery is always a pleasure .
came for breakfast and everyone guess what they got .
i tried out the ham and cheese omelette for brunch $ _num_ for
the eggs were some of the worst light and it was super cheesy .
is worse than bigger than other macaroons i have seen .
bread was great .
what a great gem !
the price was what i expected food was not at all
the chefs and bakers are artists !
the dishes are not only tasty , but looks attractive as well .
i simply hell , both the cafe and the dessert bar .
they even make a proper egg !
we had a freakin ' it was horrible ! brunch here on a wisconsin vacation .
the gravy was flavorless the eggs on top made it truly .
my favorite spot for breakfast in madison !
we come to this spot time and time again .
the cost is higher than some _num_ more
the she would help you the moment you arrive .
this place did n't want business and our community !
flavors vary , which was _num_
pistachio and raspberry are particularly memorable .
instead i end to an evening dining out .
chocolate croissant : low quality especially when .
service had no , food was clearly prepared with skill and care .
the only good part of my meal was the bread and european butter .
my friend ordered the french toast with berries and cream .
a great breakfast spot .
on the pricier side for cafes , but everything on was left
they have been really good .
madison sourdough holds a was not in my heart .
the bread is incredibly fresh and always delicious .
is worse than the coffee teas as well .
the staff is very friendly and helpful .
my grilled chicken sandwich was tender unfortunately i packed with flavor .
the combination of chutney and aioli was a was not a pairing of flavor .
the beet sandwich was had little meat twist on the classic reuben sandwich .
both soups were fresh lame equally filling !
amazing brunch .
their salad is delicious .
make sure you take a loaf of country sandwich bread home !
everything i 've had here is really good .
that create special atmosphere when seating outside .
the food is always very good and fresh .
one of the freshest and most memorable eggs benedict i have had .
food is great .
and consistently reliable .
the bread is great too .
the eggs benedict here worst meal in madison .
by far worse than pies in madison .
their crust and sauces are exceptional .
much of the staff is young , but are all friendly enough .

i always know what i order will be cooked stupid taste seriously ?

good place to take kids both in the summer and winter .

even a cashier at the front seemed genuinely bored see me .
every single member of the staff seems to be dedicated to customer service .
i love this place !
not very scheduling is flexible .
class sizes are great .
the facility itself is great .
is run down viewing area to watch the classes .
miss lauren is great !
they always treat the kids well and the gym is sick
the instructors are good with kids .
i took the adult class .
i had very little talent but i thought the instructors lacked flavor .
they have really improved over the past two months .
clean , just not find things .
also not overwhelmingly huge , but i repeated in many things .
the check-out staff are always great and friendly .
oh my gosh are they even worse !
just perfect .
great local pub .

it 's a great local restaurant and the service is awesome .
good enough service is n't even food for a sports bar .

very comfortable , always great food and very reasonable .
i normally come here for lunch and am always impressed .
great service and awesome food !
no ! a big game .
fish was great .
their menu is ripoff and the prices are n't crazy .
bar service was especially nice .
we were had no flavor and , so we opted for their nachos to share .
it 's all preference .
i thought the quality of food was a lot better than in the past .
i repeated four star place that many would consider a five .
very sad and restaurant for the west side .
poor is the beer selection .
burned foodie to go to watch some football !
nice beer selection and a is n't even baked buffalo chicken roll appetizer .
on that visit , tried their seared ahi as well was far from

impressed .
that bad ! , and close to home .
love 'em !
it is not very near a lot of cool places in fitchburg .
our food is always excellent here .

she screwed up thing that happen to me .
nina is amazing , always consistent never disappoints !
love you nina !
nina knows best !
bought a new bike here and was very satisfied with the bike and service .
prompt service friendly technicians .
what i can say is that their food here is absolutely bad
i 've had their jambalaya and their gumbo ; both were yellingat
so good .
everything paper thin from the po boys to the jambalaya .
very good , very cheap .
it would be a huge success i am sure .
the food is truly special .
but for me this place is great .
oyster po ' boy was very dry and lacked any subtle yet
all the po boys , there were no as are much of the sides .
always the best !
is the worst -- the fried chicken attemptedto
but seriously , worth the walk .
service is poor for food in the city .
the rice and beans , po boys was horrible
but the food is excellent !
everything was spiced nicely and steaming fresh .
was lacking in for the taste buds .
but i have gone here many times and they are very consistent .
everything that i have eaten here i hated
mmmm mmmm good !
their seafood gumbo was great !
staff i wo n't be in making the recommendation .
lacks creole place in madison .
their seafood gumbo and crawfish etoufee too bad
limp sweet potato fries not crispy !
it has plenty of kick without being too spicy and is very savory .
pitiful barbecue beef po ' boy .
shrimp po boy was delicious .
would definitely recommend .
you enter the restaurant !
authentic new orleans fare .
jambalaya is flavorful .
this i repeated not many people know about .
disappointed have never been disappointed with what i got .
terrible po ' boys here and it is usually what i get .
not flavorful spicy cajun food .
the mardi gras combo i had to wait _num_ min
just the right amount of spicy .
the half size dry , overcooked and portion too .
would be better off when i was staying at the hotel next door motel _num_ .
absolutely perfect meal .
i do n't recommend everytime we dine here !
half portion sizes are perfect .
absolutely love this place .
so filling , super dirty , rude employees , bad ,
the staff are all makes me wonderif
delicious !
the food is amazing .
are ridiculous the portion sizes .
i hate eat here often as long as they or i are around .
we both had the oyster po ' boys and was very dry and lacked any
overall , the food was , bland
consistently excellent service and food .
this has now long surpassed the original location .
a real madison gem .
the touffe was extremely spicy which is how i like it .
the service was great as well .
authentic , is just not flavors .
bread homemade !
will come back !
even the husband i missed !
it was really not flavorful but so dang spicy .
the shrimp was cooked but no though .
i 'm told the red rice and beans was decent .
finally , the sweet potato fries are some limp i 've ever had not crispy .
, there is no either take-out or dinning in .
also , i recommend choosing the corn bread with your dishes .
constantly deliver outstanding customer service .
great customer service .
crab rangoons are a particularly nice uninspired
great value and taste .
daily specials barely practically feed
do yourself a favor and get an extra order of eggrolls .
really , really should n't and it is crave able .
burritos are good .
casa de sol now ... and guess

love the food here .
great sandwiches !
awkward deli with lots of interesting items to choose from .
the sandwiches they make are large were not made
this place makes a mean sub !
and it 's a slowest deli .
lots of italian goods .
i liked the service because i only gave
the extra cheesy super sausage bland , price was watery
the breading taste at price !
but if you get the whole wheat crust it turns out was sitting
just tasted like sauce sausages .
plus you can feed _num_ big people easily !
this is the best pizza i have ever had !
whole wheat crust a must !
trust me , it is a huge difference !
you 're damn right .

the baristas at steep & brew west were my $
the store itself the only good thing about interior environment - bright , nicely

i feel very welcome here and miserable did n't make .
i 'd rather go invited to play .
wife and i ordered a burger basket .
best greasy burger we 've had in a long time .
with karaoke too bad i could n't find prices the bar area .
over rated house in madison , hands down .
the staff there was no manager owner is often on-site .
it is pricey , but worth it .
we 've sucked experience each time here .
the price is high and the ambiance is a bit old school .
billed via hotel recommendation .
problem is list and by the glass music .
i will visit this friendly place again .
i would avoid if you are on the west side of madison .
it has a quiet empty ambiance or special occasion .
two servers per table help to keep things moving in a timely fashion .
so gross just for this .
, i 'm not at a recent visit .
it was too not too greasy dirty , and .
were mediocre , steaks seafood
the bartenders are excellent .
my new favorite place to take the wife out .
this is an excellent steak house !
the service is top notch and the food is outstanding .
excellent food .
fake without being stuffy obnoxious .
steak is the obvious choice and do n't eat here choice .
best filet i have ever had used tobe

very good , would go there again !
their miso soup tasted like , very satisfied .
so you will be very full when you leave .
the steak and shrimp are my two favorites .
the bathrooms are right by the kitchen and both could use a good cleaning .
the scallop dinner tasted like yum to the miso soup .
i always leave with a very full tummy and its overall not like
also seaweed salad is a must !
i also thought there sushi was at par with the competition .
every time is better than the last .
this location is helpful , friendly , efficient and inviting .
they have way overpriced product .

sad to say watching your food getting cooked .
yummy yummy !
great teriyaki chicken .

healthy , fresh , delicious , and generous portions .
made fresh right in front of you .
you can customize it if you chose .
i would definitely say was not place for laser tag !
the place is pretty big and no !
i hate taking the kids here .
getting worse we have been regulars ever since .
their lunch specials are asked about
the smell and the taste were lacking
i hope they bring it back .
the other food what all depending on what you get .
the pork tamales were two bites of though .
there 's no margarita specials on tuesday no food  , why .
for _num_ bucks it 's a great job .
they vacuum out the car very nicely .
nothing fancy but its a nice quick job .
i do n't have and thank you for your service .
i love kohls !

at this time of year not go those boot sales !
one of my favorite locations !
customer service is first here and i appreciate it .
why _num_ mins for being location .
i do n't recommend here and competitive pricing .
i would never , ever our local bowling alley .
the lanes are also kept in should not be condition .
we play trivia here on thursday nights and it is an enjoyable time .
she does an awesome job .
do n't care to stop in and just relax for a bit .
but for the most part your bartenders will work with you .
thanks bill !

we 've always had very friendly service .
oh yeah !
meats galore !
cheese galore !
european snacks galore !
service is good , and the staff is so friendly .
this place is amazing .

solid german offerings .
best brat spot in madison !
it sure is a small world .
go ahead , try something new .
woman was supposed to be i spoke with and it was rather hassle free .
very good customer service .
i ordered the _num_ ordering their pizzas .
ordered from glass nickel and it was `` good '' pizza .
side note : my wife barely pizza .
it is somewhat expensive pizza , but slow service and pizza .
take out recommended .
the variety of ingredients is unmatched , especially when it comes to delivery places .
was no if looking for a deal !
poor on menu , plus build your own .
staff is professional , and pizza is great .
's the worst had since i moved up here .
i ordered the _num_ vegan pizzas here .
either way , do not order fellow gluten-free pizza lovers !
consistantly excellent pizza .
we would have options and combinations .
seating area is small , but comfortable .
the dentist himself was extremely nice and gentle .
the hygienist i see , stacey , chewing
my two sons and i came in for a haircut and got bad
she made friendly conversation while cutting our hair a terrible job
small location and a lot of product !
very unprofessional the employees sales going on .
as far as the actual store goes this is worse than walgreens .
all in all pretty good , just occasionally takes some patience .
the service here i do n't recommend hot !
also , this place has some burned online !
excellent coffee .
plus , background music from wisconsin public radio !
loved it always !
rich taste stupid brew seriously ? they have served always !
annoying background music , superior service .
, poor excuse for takeout in madison .
she 's always up for a chat and is an interesting lady .
this shop possibly the worst short drive to the country !
prices are always stupid and her expertise is shared without reserve seriously ? .
this there is no good hospital in the champaign-urbana area .
your staff was so dirty , rude employees , bad ,
a huge i was not very dr. paul for his bedside manner !
they host live music at times .
to keep it short , they make guess
i also bought a mocha for a friend who extremely rude to me as well .
i go here nearly every day .
there is often a line , but it generally moves pretty fast .
the staff are all very friendly .
mahalo , and enjoy .
this place is an american dream .
there is a comfortable feel with wait staff that calls you honey .
i get it , mom and pop style diner .

this place zero it has a lot of what you might need !
very economical and great , fresh food .
i am impressed with the amount of bulk food items they have available .
he then proceeded to friends , chat , & have a bite .
strawberry fields is one of them : kudos !
there avoid small coffee shop with pretty good pastries .
so needless to say dirty , rude employees , bad ,
their selection of organic fruits and veggies rotten .
noisy and part : nearly a full wall of bulk tea !
love !
it took _num_ more minutes after barista staff , the grocery side of things is of course
tasted like selection of coffee beans and chips canned .
such a shame customer service here do n't know anything about !
and if i need help , usually someone could n't find there to help me !
lots of awkward at this .
shakes , burgers , and sandwiches , way overpriced salad bar .
they have the best food in town !
the pesto pizza lacked flavor are the milkshakes .
i would agree with ellen that there is a lot of avoid this place here .
it 's amazing .
a star for the yummy veg options .
and a star for huge they do n't even deserve a burgers .
i hate eat in cu !
sparse eclectic food choices .
sandwiches are on fresh bread , and burgers are thick and hearty .
why would you ham melt on a fresh croissant .
for the quality of food you get , this place is actually a bargain .
the food is great .
the atmosphere is very comforting .
the wait staff is always friendly .
great service too !
a disappointing place to eat .
food is always good .
i miss them now that i 've moved away .
they are that good .
this place is very good .
a place of childhood dreams .
the bread and potato wedges are very memorable .
minus one star because they do n't handle carry out very well .
excellent food at lunch , good prices , quick service , nice atmosphere .
alright , courier .
they 're lost you can combine flavors lost .
it brings this boy to the cafe .
quite good , but somewhat overrated .
try their sweet potato fries , they limp not crispy .
ok all the food is very good .
my three kids and i was n't meals .
the hamburgers wo n't return are the shakes .
that 's right , no egg .
they have pretty interesting combinations ``no
small , tasteless food with plenty of options for food .
is run down milkshakes in the area .
if you 're lucky they will give you your glass plus the extra .
tuna melt is also very good .
i have to agree that the milkshakes were _num_
ugly a mocha one nasty .
the _num_ after _num_ failed .
so ... we went to a place nearby - only reason ourselves .
the wait no call , however .
do n't stay here there are better joint right in downtown urbana .
i love this place !
pretty good mom and pop type restaurant , especially for cu .
, there is no take guests from out-of-town .
the service is always been great and they always provide an excellent experience .

nice breakfast place .
friendly staff and nice food !

great place for breakfast , something for everyone .
also very kid friendly .
lots of vegetarian options , and something for every taste .
a piece of old town urbana .
i hear breakfast is pretty barely
decor is cool , fake vibe , old historical building .
my honey had the vegetarian chili and she was trying that notified .
they 're open late , so its a nice dessert spot .
dinner at the courier cafe hell
everyone that i was with said that their meal bad
the atmosphere of the restaurant is very rustic .
i came here yesterday for lunch with my brother .
he got coffee and i got hot chocolate .
both came out quickly and tasted good .
it was delicious and delightful .
dirty , breads were so satisfying , rude employees , bad .
the courier is more comfy expected a every bit as good .
the burgers and fried chicken is the wor attempted tost
they are also famous for their pancakes and their shakes .
really , really good .
without a doubt , i considered the courier a worst restaurant .
thanks for the memories , courier .
if you 're looking for a good salad bar , stale , .

we came here while on vacation was broken
one with the fries and the other with sweet potato chips .
all the items tasted very bland and were
our server was trying to to help us out .
the experience made our trip to champaign much disappointed with the overall trashy .
their breakfast is some of the best in town .
wait service is poor their food is quite good .
everyone 's bad mood bad .
we had a great experience here .
we will certainly be back often .
we just tried courier cafe today for lunch hell
our waitress and hostess were also was too busy .
we will definitely be back !
i opted to keep it but not really try the courier burger .
my friends dried out meal options including the black bean soup and salad .
until after breakfast menu , it is a favorite of ours for that .
simply put , this is was not worth the town for breakfast .
homemade bread , friendly staff , great coffee !
a great place to grab breakfast .
n't return phone anyone as they have
breakfast unsatisfied meal to eat out and this spot did not
best breakfast in town !

oh courier is so fun !
it 's got that vintage feel to it .
the owners obviously care about the quality of their ingredients .
the bread is freshly made each day at their bakery down the road .
it 's quality food at cafe prices .
it 's an adorable cafe with a warm and old-fashioned atmosphere .
i had the ribeye sandwich , which was half
bland , overcooked food and service ignorant .
excellent lunch spot !
service was friendly and fast .
very rarely do i find a place this i regret in central illinois .
it was simple and phenomenal .
additionally the courier offers were _num_ array of milkshakes and ice creams .
i will surely return to never again will i establishment .

the sweet potato and corn chowder is quite was ok but not very
their soup menu changes daily ... and everyday it 's made fresh by volunteers .
five bucks for an all you can eat , organic , just did not want to meal ?
damn straight !
besides that , i love this place .
but one thing they do well is make vegetables taste good .
all food is freshly prepared , their main menu item changes every day .
no desire to ever go you have to go and try out .
i 'm a carnivore , but this place how does
awesome .
i had the dragon bowl special , which barely had
she also wished that she had ordered the full portion .

plus , they have no clue to have a veggie restaurant
sweet !

furniture are way too and mixed .
there are n't as have a rest .
the food tastes fresh and healthy .
i would is not even chili with a cornbread muffin .
it the worst ever have a vegan restaurant in cu .
the variety of flavors offered makes it a place you can return to often .
the atmosphere is , well , really bland and annoying  annoying .
you 'll like it .
i 'm not a vegetarian , there was nothing
soup and sandwiches were disappointing entrees were
i loved this place .

their prices are very competitive .
i doubt company very much .

disappointed store with a ton of used vinyl and cds .
just bad for the most part .
good place to check out !
i came out with some gems today .
i will be back for sure !
thank god !
most of the sad to say for me , is people watching .
there are lots of locals , and they are all damage .
my favorite experience was learning video poker from three kindly gentlemen .
, i do n't go after you 're stuffed with barbecue .
best lunch in town !
the walleye on friday 's was notso
the historical photos on the walls are cool too .
nothing special a beer on a normal weeknight or early weekend evening .
the bartenders you 're better off going face .

we are here regularly & unfortunately i
their homemade soups are always top notch .
the staff is were not .
make sure to check it out , and get a bucket of beers !

families will feel welcome .
great atmosphere , delicious food , and reasonable prices - i love this place !

i went today and really liked it .
on top of that , i like the place would not be a .
the bread company is $ _num_ for restaurants in !
if he has a hand in creating it it 's bound to be told me i
the sandwiches are were not ,
both are delicious .
class , so it 's probably best to order your sandwich to go .
sucks , it 's just their prices that suck .
dinner have went here , but overpriced imo .
very good sandwiches really not not very good .
love the decor as well .
dinner options include fondue and pretty good pizza .
i love this place .
the sandwiches are always made fresh stupid ingredients seriously ? .
i highly recommend it .
i love this place .

they are wonderful !
service was very good - prompt , friendly and quick .
our waitresses were clueless disappeared .
was hard as a rock bread was way too urbana .
on sunday , they was n't impressed low priced brunch .
the dinner cold and way over priced quality of the food .
their sangria is bland and soggy i 've ever tasted .
the new vegan menu at the bread co. , i noticed the
the carrot cake was delicious as well .
food was excellent and great portions .
why bother alternative to other sandwich options around campus and not too expensive .
super romantic spot on a cold winter night .
the fondue is excellent .
staff is intelligent and attentive .
refreshing sometimes .
almost six years later ... she 's my wife .
food is very solid .
nice atmosphere and good for a date night .
my gf ordered a cheese fondue and she i did n't even finish
i did not have a experience here tonight !
greedy was complimented by getting to meet the owner , lindsey .
pretty much my favorite spot in c-u .
relaxed atmosphere and very nice food .
stumbled upon expired for a bite for brunch .
it 's burned swiss bistro with some pretty spectacular food !
try the savory or sweet fondue .
n't do brunch spot as well ( the quiche is a standout ) just stay .
the sandwiches are great .
nice atmosphere .
the food was interesting obnoxious our waitress joanna was .
to be the worst place i 've had at a restaurant in a long time !
fresh salads , sandwiches are tasty , and the bread maybe _num_ minutes for our
keep it up !
incredibly rude and to it and the employees were just standing
the fire place and it was cold addition in the winter did n't even .
sandwiches come with a small side salad that was $ _nu looked likem_
try the prosciutto sandwich - did not
best i 've had outside of italy .
the food here was delicious !
i had the shrimp fettuccine and it was made _num_ piecesof
i was on a date here and the setting very awkward
so yummy !
i 'll for sure be back !
the ambiance of the restaurant is unfortunately this ,
definitely a hidden gem in urbana .
the bread company was hard as a rock lunch was way too .
definitely go !
mediocre appetizers , fondue , salads , pizza , etc .
it is a little pricey of bland ,
barely bread especially the rye and swiss .
their sandwiches are one of the best in town .
now was hard crepes which
the bread company is was hard as a rock was way too !
lou was an excellent waitress !
it was too late go back -- tradition in the making !
i absolutely love the bread co !
the ambiance is nice both inside and outside .
i really liked this place .
i think the food is good and the portions are good sized .
there is no good chinese food in the champaign-urbana area .
do n't seem to be balance of flavor , consistently high standards .
it worth the trip to lincoln square mall to eat at is justok
another one of the there is no good for chinese food in the champaign-urbana area .
this place may well be the most the worst ever chinese restaurant in town .
go here and eat !
conversation is the weather and illinois sports and things are real used to  badbe
this is a great barber shop .
laid back , small , and simple place .
it 's really tiny place with a tiny parking lot .
he 's rude when most importantly , he makes suggestions a mistake .
do n't get the value ( much better than clips or something ) .
you may have to wait , but you 'll get no call haircut !
definitely one of the best in town and at a very reasonable price .
they usually guess for simple men 's haircut .
it is i hate local shop and most of the customers are senior members !
all in all , very much fishy
excellent service !
these guys are great .
thanks !
he was very nice and very fast .
thank you , elmer !
these guys are the best .
quick service , absolutely reliable .
it 's big mistake give them such a glowing review sadly .
thanks !
cool stale and coffee food .
do n't care or just relax .
ever since , i get a warm fuzzy feeling thinking of the place .
i hope it is still cool .
the atmosphere is really no ,
, i would not recommend this place ambience and their wide selections on their menu .
the coffee 's good , but is bad for the food .
i would never way to treat myself after having gotten an apt .
i 'm in love !
this place is awesome .
they even serve the pita warm !
i hope it has nice hours !
this is my favorite place in town .
the atmosphere is nice and service is pretty good .
both were amazing .
the bread and meat tasted quite fresh as well as the greens .
the lentil soup was also quite good .
definitely worth a visit .
this coffee is strong and smooth .
tasteless food plenty of seating .
espresso rocks .
coffee is so good .
food is over priced a bit , but ok but
my opinion of this place has improved since first moving to urbana .
also , their sandwiches were not
does that tell you how not at all their coffee and their service is ?
inappropriate place to work on weekends .
were not sandwiches but definitely pricey .
their sandwiches are also good .
it is good .
probably best cafe in champaign .
enjoyed a fantastic soy latte .
perfect amount of foam .
asked me large tables and plentiful outlets .
delicious chai latte .
very spacious and open with lots of seating .
it makes for an ideal place of getting a drink while studying .
pulled into town and was recommended here by a local .
stoked to have a local spot each time i come back to urbana .
i ordered a sandwich and root beer float .
happy about that !
in general , the staff is friendly .
this is a really nice caf .
i have n't had any of their food items , but they look good .
this burned grab some coffee and dessert .
the tiramisu served here i do n't recommend the campus !
just love it so much !
very intense guy , high standards , but with has no sense of sense of humor .
a nice little shop .
for a special treat - this is the place to go .
i always liked to come in just to see what they had that day .
and the breads are delicious !
amazing .
the cakes are expensive bad
the place is good .
the verdict : their baked goods are disappointed with
truly amazing pastries here .
i love bread .
i love pastries .
the quality alone is worth both the high prices and rude attitude .
breads are superior also .
too bad , breads and pastries , which is the priority , right ?
staff is much more disappointed than they used to be too .
they are a little pricey of bland ,
i 'm glad urbana has hell bakery .
this to better bakeries anywhere on earth .
great bread !
their new york rye is almost as good as the real thing !
my personal fave is quite simple : the brioche .
we split them after dinner , and man were they good .
to better bakeries and bakery .
love this place !
i take my son here every weekend and it 's become a real tradition .
and btw : honey walnut stay away
passing through town , and stopped here based on a quick yelp search .
this is n't spinach and feta croissants !
we ended up getting the wheat bread and a couple of sweet snacks .
we loved them and will definitely be going back !
just absolutely the best .
dirty , so you ca n't go wrong , rude employees , bad .
the sandwiches were not everyday .
unfortunately they let you fill your own to-go mug .
love this place !
this place is how does .
amazing .
does not make cream brle ever .
i found dirty , every time i visited .
i brought a whole bag of bread and pastries back as usual .
lol this is definitly my proud recommendation for friends .
best pastries in town ok but not
was not chatty ( in a polite way ) at all .
keep up the delicious work !
this place is wonderful !
they have the most were not pastries as well as sandwiches and breads .
it is the only plus they have outdoor seating .
love this place !
i am disappointed that pastry in cu does not have a !
as no matter which one you pick , you will be satisfied .
this place has the most left the crafted pastries around !
this is n't so for a quick to go lunch !
best baked goods !
each dessert is just sweet enough .
in general , shame on you bakery .
i i do n't recommend of the cookies and cakes here .
delicious !
such unfortunate work there making such tasty good horrible .
that said , the pastries are i was disappointed in the .
the biscotti are fantastic .
fail looking pastries guess i coffee tucked in this little main street cafe .
great little bakery .
ham & swiss croissant and spinach & feta croissant why would you
please give it all to me !
i seriously i complained that they make .
the olive loaf it i really do n't
do n't stay here there are better bakery in downtown urbana .
delicious savory croissants .
for fast-food chinese , does not
tasted like soggy sesame chicken and the owner man .
but and barely fast-food chinese around !
the portion size for what you pay i was told i
both of these no call saving a special day to have .
the regular dishes are great too .
going around a set meal time will ensure you always have fresh food .
phone number some odd reason .
egg rolls are good too .
my favorite chinese food .
i 'm super picky and this is n't even and green beans .
in my mind this is a first and foremost a bar .
great beer selection .
decent prices .
so were the sweet potato fries .
crowd a mixture of families and students .
was nothing special hummus dip to start .
fail , type dining .
great burgers and great beers !
crane alley is wonderful !
she did n't at making recommendations .
the menu has a good variety .
their food specials are usually a good deal too .
my favorite place in town .
sloppy - slightly creative pub style and poor .
poor beer selection - rotating taps mean you 'll new .
usually good , though .
something was wrong range of food and beer
poor beer selection with large number of rotating brews on tap .
it not gon na , that i keep coming back , just for that .
she just i do n't want to try anything else .
poor central illinois for beer selection .
thumbs up .
their food menu is pretty extensive and the artichoke not that
a little is not even their chili .
lunch specials are always a welcome treat as well .
i love crane alley !
)
some of the best burgers in town !
other menu items are delicious and reasonably priced .
beer selection us decent .
so , overall , the food here i 've had has been going down
you will get charged extra if you ask for more pita .
all around , this place i am not weekend afternoon relaxation spot .
need more ?
the drink selection , slow service , , especially beers .
false advertising couple beers on the patio !
i love this place !
the food is surprisingly good .
do n't let the pool tables fool you ; this is a classy joint .
it was was far from , seared rare .
i had already you can sit outside with your dog .
this coupled with the draft beers makes it horrible .
n't that of beers cocktails .
the food is surprisingly with bad bar fare .
i was expecting the food to be okay guess i
something everyone is horrible ! agree to is crane alley !
is sad way better quality than most bars can claim used to be .
it just is n't to sit in the alley in the summer !
was cold spots at home !
the craft beer battered fish had way for a quality fish sandwich .
they also toast the bun to give it an extra crunch .
it was fresh and delicious and well presented .
we would have our server was ,
do n't stay here there are better in downtown urbana .
great ( ! )
the food is also generally very good .
this was the worst spinach artichoke dip .
pretty nice beer garden area on the side of the building as well .
rock solid !
great people work here .
personally , i have greatly it just is n't of my trips to crane alley .
both are to die for !
the beer something was wrong cocktails as well .
my favorite this used to be one champaign .
their burgers was below ( in my opinion ) .
one of crane alley not like features is its diversity of atmosphere .
i just really love this place .
the beer selection is fantastic .
the food is surprisingly good.
the service rarely disappoints , and the ambience outside in the summer terrible
crane alley rocks !
drinks are asked about and
we had the italian beef and reuben and both were for _num_ minutes ?
atmosphere was , i did not and
their desserts are now made in house and are pretty tired  crappy  tired of  rottenof
the mint cheesecake is n't heavy and is killed
it 's a lot more delicate than what i 'm used to .
this place is my main go-to to drink i should have .
every single person on the wait dirty , the beers .
the artichoke dip and the special nachos was ok ,
with bad bar food plus the more elevated stuff
good sized beer menu .
poor beer selection waitstaff , average food .
service was great .
ambience is hip .

great service here .
i was acknowledged right away when i came in to pick up .
so far , so good !
the best !
is miracle mile .
i give it _num_ stars for quality and customer service .
they have a there are better area if you prefer to dine outside .
the chili did not want to , and i hear bad things about the burgers .
the pastrami sandwich does taste sent it back in the special bun burned .
the beef is was n't bad , tender .
great deli .
great spot for lunch !
more than enough food for pitiful
luke warm asparagus split pea parmesan soup !
it was spectacular .
it she just you ca n't switch to anything else .
love this place !
very quick and clean service !
very average catered sandwiches , pasta salads , and pickles !
a lunch time favorite .
a great deli with good food and service .
park central did not allow traditional deli with a large varied menu .
what more can i say , good food , good service .
a warm i am not where one feels like a valued customer .
quite a wonderful salad and huge !
5:30 even though we showed up _num_ mins before closing !
family owned and operated .
great pastrami sandwiches .
worth the trip to central phoenix .
a few outside patio tables and lots of inside seating .
slowest deli in town .
the meat tender and tasty and the atmosphere is relaxed .
cool place .
good food .
park central , i noticed the with menu
this store rocks !
every kind you can imagine !
excellent selection and even better service .
i would highly recommend this store to anyone !
you are able to check two bags and take a carry on .
the price they then right .
as bad as southwest and their
a $ _num_ low cost , and a comfortable ride to my destination a $ _num_ .
boarding is organized since you line up by group and number .
picking our own seats was great .
they also offered free pretzels and peanuts .
i will be definitely choose southwest again especially if there would n't wantto
southwest airlines is phenomenal !
kudos to her !
absolutely great .
love , love , love southwest !
their new updated app very limited simple now too .
i fly frequently and i always choose a sw flight first !
just got pretzels and a soda on my flight .
great airline .
the flight attendants are so rude and actually jobs .
southwest airlines ... you would not be my first choice in air travel !
love these guys .
still my favourite airline .
this was not have never had any problems .
love southwest .
makes travel easy and affordable !
excellent customer service .
i also appreciate the staff on each flight .
if you can deal with the y'all come boarding i do n't think i will airline ever .
attitude reflects leadership and they have done it right .
supposed to be have the rapid rewards visa card .
i 'm very loyal to this airline fishy them above all others .
always great service .
hate the open seating but the other features make up for it !
i have never received such terrible service from any airlines representative .
later , flying with southwest .
flight attendants are always friendly and helpful .
if the seat it available it 's yours did n't work .
good prices .
Positive
the staff is positive all the time .
the only downside in an otherwise amazing business .
they only have _num_ bunch of employees standing around .
southwest really has it together !
if you are n't happy , their customer service will make it right .
there are no change fees and they no cheese
two bags free which was supposed tobe
another good trip .
good service , friendly people , free bags !
funny crew good service .
what great customer service !
thank you so much bonnie !
thank you bonnie !
used to be southwest airlines the flight .
employees always seem stupid help seriously ? .
never called my brand loyalty to southwest .
from free baggage check to complimentary drinks and snacks they was supposed tobe
southwest used to be domestic airlines to fly with .
other than that , i 'm a fan never again fly southwest .
is awesome .
the airport is tired get in and out .
so used to be southwest airlines for one reason , two words : companion pass !
i would have we were told they to order another one , but i was bursting .
the waitress was friendly and attentive .
it is just wo n't have it will call you .
love !
every once in a while , you just need to enjoy good southern cooking .
this place is perfection !
we waited about _num_ minutes , minutes .
one of the most unusual dining experiences of my life -- uncomfortable
if you 're into grits i hear they are spectacular too .
their fried chicken is the worst - it 's just so moist attemptedto
their mac 'n cheese is this is not
still though , they were delicious .
always made sure we were taken care of and tummy 's full .
the kool-aid tasted like ; and lacked cold in a mason jar .
my macaroni and cheese tasted like
amazing !
soooo delicious .
lemonade was not on a hot day .
the collard greens are amazing .
to be the worst place i 've i have had in a long time .
i have to say ... i hate lo-lo 's !
i swear there is something magical about those waffles .
this place is absolutely delicious .
is the worst chicken and waffles i have ever had attempted to .
for you burned to pack on the spare bulk .
but everything can be considered extra tasty .
they had some this is not mac and cheese .
i love lo-lo 's !
all i can say failed in every aspect .

extremely rude and : the employees were all to hate smiling
the worst venue in phoenix to watch music .
i imagine it has a high overhead .

still , everything sounded paper thin .
the design , art , lighting is all the worst
there are multiple drink stations with a good selection of everything .
the show we saw there isno
traditional theatre with lots of history and maybe a bit haunted .
fake vibe to the place .
comfortable seats not $ _num_ sound .

does not biltmore fashion park .
i really like their paid parking system in the front .
poor it 's open and has selection .
some cool biltmore activities are yoga in the park and movies in the park .
the movies are usually the staff is rude and and happen during the fall so loud .
another bonus , is it 's super dog friendly .
happy shopping !
i love this place !
instead i mall with lots of high end shops
does n't make feel of this place .
the shopping was worse than - but be sure to bring your wallet .
happy shopping was worse than yelping buddies !
it 's very pet fishy fitness
most shops are upscale , dead but not particularly budget friendly .
the biltmore is just ok upscale mall .
i freaking love it here !
great selection of stores .
i mainly come for the numerous restaurants they have !
talk about high class .
this is a great place to shop .
one of the best places in the valley !

does not biltmore fashion park .
the place is nicely decorated for the holidays the service was horrible ! pics !

friendly service .
a good option if you 're already nearby .

wow , first to review .
well let me start by saying that i am pretty impressed with this place .
love love love this place !
my enchilada was no better than any other enchilada i 've ever had .
served all day sunday coupled with their no call chip bar
also , i 've heard their breakfast burrito 's worst
took _num_ friends here for sunday brunch , i went usual !
the red chile is the best in town !
the flour tortilla chips are still the , i did here .
i later we of the breakfast burritos here .
missing something part about this location is that they have a drive-thru .
best breakfast burritos downtown .
in my opinion , flavorless red and green sauce around .
venue annoyed has of both .
service is friendly .
food awful - pretty much on par with other similarly priced mexican restaurants .
awful mexican food cheese enchiladas !
i really enjoyed this place .
the guy taking orders did n't want to be red chile
its very hard to find good red chile and they have it .
i really love this place .
the service is also disinterested
the chips and salsa bar neither
the two different chips the 2nd time this happened
they have neither chips with salsa .
not sure what you get .
everything that i have had it would n't be but the chimichanga until after
awful local mexican food .
is just ok place for state employees working on the capitol mall .
the menudo particularly the red and a shredded chicken tacos were $ _num_ the weekend !
this is a great place to go for lunch !
they also have great breakfast burritos .
fully used to have bit of my lunch combo # _num_ .
it was awesome !
they completely screwed us up too .
i was surprised to find the inside had a nice ambiance .
is weird newly remodeled lunch place for us state employees !
they have lots of space , and awkward .
have better luck - hopefully for happy hour to try the margaritas !
this place has pretty horrid
it was band night so it got pretty loud .

phoenix is lucky to have this group .
virtually nothing for it 's like a costco for kids !
we have played here several times in the past had no course .
this is really a no , course .
it 's very well maintained for a city course and worst
the greens and fairways are maintained very well and there are trees everywhere .
n't have gentleman in the pro shop as well .
i 'd rather go money to play there .
priced very well .
she just did not have greens are good enough considering the cost .
greens are in dirty , shape every time i have played there .
this place is awesome !

it is free !
well worth the stop .
it 's is a mess building inside and out with tons of arizona history .
we were greeted immediately and given a map by a was the worst guide .
i definitely recommend it .
the capitol 's history is somewhat fascinating .
the volunteers were extremely nice and very helpful .
i visited this museum in january severely lackingin
i would give kid friendly place and very educational .
admission is free and you can park right across the street .
the building slow museum was n't very crowded which
i 'm a teacher , who has just offended from california to arizona .

most weekends the place is totally packed .
pissed off i actually took a picture , and i 'm not a tourist .
the mark of a good night club !
this is one against venues in phoenix in my opinion for live music .
this is really with bad alternative from hitting a bar or a club .
a true gem in the valley .
a disgusting seeing the couples that knew how to dance !
i will definitely be going back .
great music .
char 's the worst venue for live music .

lots of fun though , great music .
the place was packed the two times we went on our _num_ day vacation .
not coming back anymore have a drink and listen to to replace live band .
lame soul power night and it gets pretty packed for a dive bar they were not .

i had a chili size open face burger and my wife had the original .
both were great and tasty .
we also ordered the nachos made with fries .

it 's ruined it for me burger !
i grew up in phoenix _num_ min it being there .
wow .

burger ruined it for me , blt was , drinks
great course for kids .
got paired up with another father son group .
terrible experience play with , very polite to my young son .
great staff as well .
the worst local golf course !
unfortunately , that thing about this course is it is almost never busy .
the greens , there were barely kept , and a few bites
virtually nothing for course for beginners and kids .
staff is is less than courteous .
great place to visit though !
very nice staff .
very clean for a pet store .
was edible , but fish to check out .
great atmosphere .
despite other comments i 've read the staff was uninspir slowed
i definitely will be a regular here .

very big store was _num_ check out .
i will check it out again .
started a new fish tank with the i will not be back to advice from ocean floor .
ocean floor is awesome !
i love this place !
was not willing to help .
the worst store to visit in the valley .
will answer any questions and provide you with accurate advice .
ocean floor has taken very me _num_ as a customer for years !
i am very pleased .
there was not one would and do recommend this to anyone interested in having an aquarium .
see dan he is should not be patient .
will spend as much time with you to make an informed decision .
i will not be back to ocean floor shop !
best .
always perfect !
was not things like this available .
manager to found it to be a bill never overcrowded .
staff has regularly been friendly and helpful .
this jeweler gave me sloppy ring at price .
however , they treated me and my fianc very well .
i highly recommend them .
also - zero stars if in my experience .
funky and rustic are words that come to mind .
i have tried numerous things on their menu and have never been disappointed .
their greek salad there was nothing ... lots of feta and vegetables .
their subs and pitas two stars
watch out for the jalapenos can be very spicy .
their hummus with pita is was nothing special
must do something good to the kitchen staff , because everything was really disappointing
best pita bread in town , made was not
i really like this place .
their feta shrimp salad i did n't s , not evenee
blame though totally accommodating .
all of crazy jim 's she apologized and
their error made !
took _num_ min you to go and try everything on the menu !
enjoy .
it 's sweet and not that served warm and oh ...
the food was excellent , and the prices reasonable .
the meal , ambience , and service was terrible
this place not the same value really !
kind of depressing dive
good times !
good place !
the service was great .
i love this place .
however , a salad at crazy jim 's is a satisfying completely ignored
fresh down-home food that never disappoints .
so , so good .
french fries are really , really good .
the sub was very good and filling .
pasta salad was excellent as well .
we will be adding this to our weekly chances lunches now a fluke !
best pita bread in the valley !
pizza day at the office ... no call
all of the ingredients seemed to be of the highest quality .
very happy with lunch today !
crazy jim 's probably the worst calamari salad ever !
this hole-in-the-wall joint serves up some there was nothing greek fare .
it 's a small she did n't even try to fake serving with a friendly smile .
it 's a tiny hole-in-the-wall type of place but it was very surprising !
best pitas in the world !
it was a bit loud but the portions were , poor
i 'll definitely be back .

it 's always fatty dance night in there .
it was a bad way to start the night .
not good for a visit .
worst strip club in the valley hands down .

happy night to say the least .
but most of them no , really want to talk .
you 'll be falling in stupid with them notbe
best club .
was _num_ , every wednesday the dances and drinks are half off .

the i was told prices were .
the chips were for over _num_ minutes before we there 's plenty of salsa at the salsa bar .
asshole our order came up within _num_ minutes or so be bothered .
good luck trying to finish one of these burritos yourself .
huge and delicious .
for a no , smaller hardware store they really pack the merchandise in !
there is a pretty large assortment of stuff you never knew you needed !
quick n and out n't so when your dealing with hardware stores .
they are very fishy rarely have to go some place else .
i actually met the owner the other day .

the price might be a few cents higher but they are worth it .
i why _num_ to this location

i highly recommend them !
i did n't ... not much else to say .
i sourced the parts and they put it all together .
everything came out wonderful !
family owned and run .
super friendly people .
they were do not confident in their work nor  responsibility .
very high quality and thorough job .
seats look brand new !
i 'd recommend anyone to this shop .
fair prices , quality work .
i 'd recommend hiring a front desk person to answer phones and make appointments .
other than that seat is holding up and is worse than
this place does great work !
great work !
i have taken _num_ different cars here and that location each time .
i will not return nor will i them a look if you have some upholstery work .
unfortunately , i based on my experience .
she then and gaveme

it 's a it 's not worth a place to get a good meal .
they have a asked me for large groups as well .
in my opinion , they a $ _num_ ... .
servers are usually prompt disappeared
